However, much to the students' surprise, Cinta didn't win. The grand prize in the contest is awarded to a boy named Rangga (Nicholas Saputra), whose name is rarely heard of in the school. However, Rangga, rather than going to the podium to receive his prize, took offence and retreated to a hiding spot. Cinta is somewhat jealous of Rangga's unexpected victory, but is careful not to show it. This leads Cinta to search for Rangga and request an interview for the school bulletin. However, Rangga immediately detects insincerity in Cinta's congratulations and walks away, leaving Cinta to be irritated by his perceived arrogance.
