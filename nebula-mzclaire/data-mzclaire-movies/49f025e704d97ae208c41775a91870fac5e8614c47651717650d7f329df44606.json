{"country":"France","distributed_by":"Orion Classics","chocolat":"English-language film poster","Plot":"The film begins with an adult woman named France, walking down a road toward Douala, Cameroon. While walking, she is picked up by William J. Park (Emmet Judson Williamson), an African American who has moved to Africa and is driving to Limbe with his son. As they ride, France's mind drifts and we see her as a young girl in Northern French Cameroon where her father was a colonial administrator. The story is conducted through the eyes of young France, showing her friendship with the \"houseboy\", Protée, as well the sexual tension between him and her young and beautiful mother, Aimée. The conflict of the film comes from the discomfort created as France and her mother attempt to move past the established boundaries between themselves and the native Africans. This is brought to a head through Luc Segalen (Jean-Claude Adelin), a Western drifter who stays with the Dalens family after a small aircraft crashes nearby. He makes public the evident sexual attraction between Aimée and Protée, prompting the mother to act on her desire. This results in a fight between Luc and Protée, who consequently loses his in-house job and is moved to work outdoors in the garage as a mechanic.The title Chocolat comes from the 1950s slang meaning \"to be cheated\", and thus refers to the status in French Cameroon of being black and being cheated. Towards the end of the film, France's father reveals a central theme of the film as he explains to her what the horizon line is. He tells her that it is a line that is there but not there, a symbol for the racial boundary that exists in the country. This line is not a physical one but is still one that people widely recognize.","language":"French","cinematography":"Robert Alazraki","directed_by":"Claire Denis","Soundtrack":"The soundtrack, performed and recorded by Abdullah Ibrahim, was released in 1988 as Mindif","release_dates":"1988","produced_by":"Alain Belmondo, Gérard Crosnier,","starring":"François Cluzet, Isaach De Bankolé, Giulia Boschi","running_time":"105 minutes","music_by":"Abdullah Ibrahim","edited_by":"Monica Coleman, Claudine Merlin, Sylvie Quester","written_by":"Claire Denis, Jean-Pol Fargeau"}
