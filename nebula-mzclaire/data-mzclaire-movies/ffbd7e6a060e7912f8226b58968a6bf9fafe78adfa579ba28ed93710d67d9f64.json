Of course there are specific things that have been exaggerated or changed for cinematic purposes. Part of the experience of watching this movie is the experience of seeing that Donald Kaufman is credited as the co-screenwriter. It's part of the movie, it's part of the story.\"The idea to do a film adaptation of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief dates back to 1994.[9] Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997,[10] eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block.[11] Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character.[12] By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script;[13] he turned in a third draft in November 2000.[14]Kaufman explained,The idea of how to write the film didn't come to me until quite late. It was the only idea I had, I liked it, and I knew there was no way it would be approved if I pitched it. So I just wrote it and never told the people I was writing it for. I only told Spike Jonze, as we were making Being John Malkovich and he saw how frustrated I was. Had he said I was crazy, I don't know what I would have done.[15]In addition Kaufman stated, \"I really thought I was ending my career by turning that in!\"[16]Adaptation went on fast track in April 2000, with Kaufman making some revisions.[1] Scott Brake of IGN gave the script a positive review in June 2000,[17] as did Drew \"Moriarty\" McWeeny of Ain't It Cool News in October.[18] Columbia Pictures committed to North America distribution only after Intermedia came aboard to finance the film in exchange for international distribution rights.[19] Filming started in late March 2001 in Los Angeles, and finished by June.[5] The \"evolution\" fantasy sequence was created by Digital Domain, while Skywalker Sound was responsible for the audio mixing of Adaptation.
