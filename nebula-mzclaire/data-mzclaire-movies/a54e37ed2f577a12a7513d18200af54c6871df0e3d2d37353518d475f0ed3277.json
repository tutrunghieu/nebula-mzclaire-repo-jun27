The project's automatic countermeasures activate and attack robots are sent in to the past to try to eliminate the virus carriers. They fail to contain the virus, and Sinclair returns to 2073 to find the Earth in ruins, ravaged by both the virus and the attack robots continually sent from the original timeline.
