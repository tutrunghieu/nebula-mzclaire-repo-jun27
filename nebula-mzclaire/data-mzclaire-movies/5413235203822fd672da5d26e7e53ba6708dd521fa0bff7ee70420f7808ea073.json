{"distributed_by":"Warner Roadshow Distributrors","Plot":"The movie is divided into three clear timelines, the 1960s, the World War II period and the bucolic period (in order from newest to oldest). In the 1960s, the rich Della Franca family start a fight with the poor Bisbikis family over a man that romances with women from both families. The Della Franca's manage to put the mother of the Bisbikis', Lavrentia, out of business, which triggers the World War II flashback, where Lavrentia worked with the Greek Resistance. In that period, another event triggers the bucolic period in the form of Lavrentia talking about her ancestors, a man and a woman that lived in a small village in the countryside. No clear main plot existent in any period, the film mainly revolves around Lavrentia's history and the tragic events that stained her life. In the end of the film, it is revealed that the Bisbikis' are actually blood-related to the Della Franca's and they all live happily ever after.Although the film features mostly tragic events, they are presented in a way that parodies older movies of the Greek cinema, rendering them hilarious.[according to whom?] It is both a tribute and a satire of old Greek dramas, war movies and bucolic-style films.","language":"Greek","cinematography":"Kostas Gkikas","directed_by":"Thanasis Papathanasiou Michalis Reppas","release_dates":"Greece: 26 October 2001 Australia: May 1, 2003","produced_by":"Helena Hatzialexandrou","starring":"Anna Panayiotopoulou Mirka Papakonstantinou Tasos Halkias Maria Kavoyanni Joys Evidi Michalis Reppas Mina Adamaki Alexandros Antonopoulos Mimis Chrisomalis Kostas Evripiotis Sofia Filippidou Takis Hrisikakos Antonis Kafetzopoulos Trifon Karatzas Krateros Katsoulis Vladimiros Kiriakidis Kostas Koklas Elissavet Konstantinidou Anna Kyriakou Renia Louizidou Nena Menti Arietta Moutousi Yorgos Partsalakis Dimitris Piatas Hristos Valavanidis Yannis Zouganelis","running_time":"101'","music_by":"Afrodite Manou","External links":"","edited_by":"Ioanna Speliopoulos","written_by":"Thanasis Papathanasiou Michalis Reppas","budget":"â‚¬1,32 million"}
