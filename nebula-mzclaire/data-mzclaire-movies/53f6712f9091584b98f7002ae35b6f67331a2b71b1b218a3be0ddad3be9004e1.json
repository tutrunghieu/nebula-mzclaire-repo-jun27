The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others.The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.[1]","produced_by":"Sherry Simpson Dean & Desiree Markgraaff","language":"English / Zulu","amandla!:_a_revolution_in_four-part_harmony":"Official movie poster","edited_by":"Johanna Demetrakas","cinematography":"Brand Jordaan Ivan Leathers Clive Sacke","production_company":"ATO Pictures"}
