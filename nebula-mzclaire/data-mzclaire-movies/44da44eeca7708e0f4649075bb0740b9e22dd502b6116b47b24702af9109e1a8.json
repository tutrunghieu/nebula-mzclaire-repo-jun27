{"country":"United States","distributed_by":"Zion Films","Plot":"Brigham City is about a small, idyllic town in rural Utah. Wes (Richard Dutcher) is the town sheriff, a widower, and one of seventeen bishops in the town. There had never been a murder reported in the town until one day when Wes comes upon the crime scene of a murdered woman. Since Wes has no experience in murder investigations and because he wants to keep the murder's influence out of his town, he calls in the FBI from their closest office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Suspicion becomes rampant as more murders occur, until the killer is finally exposed.","language":"English","Reception":"The film has a 71% \"Fresh\" rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews.[3]","box_office":"$852,206[2]","production_company":"Main Street Movie Company","directed_by":"Richard Dutcher","release_dates":"March 30, 2001[1]","produced_by":"Richard Dutcher","starring":"Richard Dutcher Matthew A.
