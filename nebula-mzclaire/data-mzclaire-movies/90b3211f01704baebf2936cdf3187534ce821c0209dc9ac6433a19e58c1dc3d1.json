Meanwhile, Stiva meets his old friend Konstantin Levin, a wealthy land owner and aristocrat who is looked down upon by Moscow's elite for preferring country life to city life. Levin professes his love for Stiva's sister-in-law, Princess Katerina \"Kitty\" Alexandrovna, and Stiva encourages him to propose. However, Kitty declines as she hopes to marry Count Alexei Vronsky. Later, Levin meets with his elder brother Nikolai, who has given up his inheritance and taken a prostitute named Masha as his wife. Nikolai suggests that Levin marry one of the peasants on his estate. On the train to Moscow, Anna meets Vronsky's mother, Countess Vronskaya, and once there Anna meets Vronsky himself, and they have immediate mutual attraction. When a railway worker is killed in an accident at the station, Vronsky is seen by Anna, Stiva, and the Countess giving a large sum of money to the worker's family. Anna convinces Dolly to take Stiva back. At a ball that night, Kitty attempts to dance with Vronsky, but he dances with Anna, attracting the attention of everyone in attendance and leaving Kitty heartbroken. Anna boards a train to St. Petersburg, but at a rest stop notices Vronsky, who declares that he must be wherever she goes. She tells him to go back to Moscow, but he refuses.In St. Petersburg, Vronsky visits his cousin Princess Betsy Tverskaya, a friend of the Karenins, and begins to show up at all the places Anna and Betsy visit. Vronsky flirts openly with Anna at a party, which catches Karenin's attention. He suggests they go home, but Anna chooses to stay. Vronsky tells her of his intention to take a promotion in another city but Anna persuades him to stay and the next day they meet at a hotel and make love.Stiva visits Levin at his country estate and informs Levin that Kitty and Vronsky are no longer to be married. Levin focuses on living an authentic country life, working in his fields with his workers and contemplating taking one of their daughters as his wife, as his brother had suggested.Karenin hears that his wife and Vronsky are in the country estate and surprises them there, after she reveals to Vronsky that she is pregnant. Later she encounters Karenin who suggests he join them for the horse races that evening. The races begin, and Anna betrays her feelings for Vronsky as his horse falls and injures him. On their way home Anna admits to Karenin that she is Vronsky's mistress and wishes to divorce him. Karenin refuses and instead confines her to home. Levin sees Kitty in a passing carriage and realises that he still loves her. Anna receives Vronsky at her house in St. Petersburg and as she complains about why he failed to come earlier, he tells her that his duties as an officer have delayed his visit. Karenin comes back home to find out that Vronsky was visiting Anna, as seen from the love letters found in her desk. Meanwhile, Levin and Kitty are reunited at Stiva's house, and Karenin announces he is divorcing Anna, who begs him to forgive her, which he refuses. After dinner, Levin and Kitty announce their love to each other and decide to marry. Anna goes into premature labour.

Anna now begins to suspect Vronsky of unfaithfulness. She attends the opera where the upper class audience regard her with disdain as someone who \"has broken the rules\". Though humiliated, she retains her poise, only to break down once back at her hotel. The next day, Anna has lunch at a restaurant where the society women avoid her. Dolly, however, joins her and tells her that Kitty is in Moscow to have her first child. Dolly says that Stiva's behavior has not changed, but she has come to accept and love him for who he is.

The film received a positive review score of 63% according to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Metacritic reported an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 41 reviews and classified the film as \"generally favorable\".[20]Oliver Lyttleton of The Playlist awarded the film a B+ and called the picture a \"bold reimagining\" of the classic novel, comparing Wright's vision to the films of Powell and Pressburger. He noted how Knightley \"continues to go from strength to strength\" and also praised Law as \"excellent\". Even though he speculated that \"the film is going to divide people enormously\", he concluded it was one to \"cherish despite its flaws\".[21] Ian Freer of Empire awarded the film four stars out of five and was effervescent in his praise for Wright and the final result: he said \"Anna Karenina militantly doesn’t want to be just another costume drama; it attacks the heavyweight concerns of Russian literature (hypocrisy, jealousy, faith, fidelity, the pastoral vs. the urban, huge moustaches) with wit and verve; most exciting of all, it is filmmaking of the highest order, channeling every other art form from painting to ballet to puppetry while remaining completely cinematic\". He lauded the entire cast for their work yet concluded that \"this is really its director's movie\".[22]In The Observer Jason Solomons also called Knightley \"superb\", and declared that the film \"works beautifully...[it is] elegant and exciting [and] ...incredibly cinematic\".[23] Leslie Felperin of Variety was more reserved in her praise for the film, observing that although Wright \"knows how to get the best from Knightley\" and noting that the film was technically \"glorious\", it was also \"unmistakably chilly\" in the storytelling.[24] The Daily Mirror singled out Knightley as \"excellent\" and lauded Wright for \"offer[ing] a fresh vision of the Tolstoy classic\", concluding the picture to be \"with its beautiful cinematography and costumes... a real success\".[25]Others were less impressed with the film and Wright's take on such a classic text. The Hertfordshire Mercury conceded that \"costumes and art direction are ravishing, and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography shimmers with rich colour\", but ultimately found there to be \"no obvious method behind this production design madness\".[26] Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy also awarded the picture only two stars out of five, commenting that \"the third time isn't such a charm for director Joe Wright and muse Keira Knightley\". Although she found the actress \"luminous in the role\" she criticised Wright for \"outshining\" his star and affecting the narrative momentum by \"favouring a glossy look over probing insights into a complicated character\".[27] Neil Smith of Total Film also awarded the film two out of five stars, lamenting the fact that Wright's elaborate stage design \"pull[s] the attention away from where it should be... [and] keeps [us] at arm's length, forever highlighting the smoke, mirrors and meticulous stage management that have been pressed into service to make his big idea a reality\". He also dismissed Knightley's performance as \"less involving\" than her \"similar\" turn in The Duchess.[28] Richard Brody of The New Yorker criticised Wright for diverging from Tolstoy, without adding anything beyond superficialities in return: \"Wright, with flat and flavorless images of an utterly impersonal banality, takes Tolstoy’s plot and translates it into a cinematic language that’s the equivalent of, say, Danielle Steel, simultaneously simplistic and overdone.\"[29]","box_office":"$68,929,150[3]","cinematography":"Seamus McGarvey","production_company":"Working Title Films StudioCanal","directed_by":"Joe Wright","release_dates":"7 September 2012 (2012-09-07) (UK & IRL)|9 November 2012 (2012-11-09) (US)|10 January 2013 (2013-01-10) (Russia)|||","Production":"Joe Wright was hired to direct an adaptation of the Leo Tolstoy novel Anna Karenina, his fourth collaboration with Working Title Films.[5][8] Wright shot most of his film on a single soundstage at Shepperton Studios in a dilapidated theatre outside London.[9][10] Italian composer Dario Marianelli composed the film score, while Jacqueline Durran served as the costume designer. Sarah Greenwood was in charge of production design. Wright has worked with all three in past productions, including on the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice. Further crew members include cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, editor Melanie Ann Oliver, and choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui.[5]The cast include Keira Knightley as Anna, Jude Law as her husband, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as her young love,[4][11] and Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson as Konstantin Levin, as well as Kelly Macdonald, Olivia Williams, Matthew Macfadyen, Michelle Dockery, and Tannishtha Chatterjee.[6][12][13][14] Saoirse Ronan and Andrea Riseborough were initially cast in the film, but dropped out and were replaced by Alicia Vikander and Ruth Wilson, respectively. Ronan, stated that her reasoning behind turning down the role of Kitty was the film's long production schedule. It would have required her to turn down movie roles from autumn 2011 to late spring 2012, to film what would have ended up as a supporting role. By turning down the role, she was able to take the lead roles in Byzantium and The Host.[15] The Borgias star Holliday Grainger had a minor role as Baroness Shilton.In July 2011, Keira Knightley began rehearsals,[16] in preparation for principal filming which began later in 2011.[17] Filming began in October 2011.[8] The film was distributed by Focus Features in North America and by Universal Pictures International for international markets. The film was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and 9 November 2012 in the United States.[9][18][19]","produced_by":"Tim Bevan|Eric Fellner|Paul Webster|","starring":"Keira Knightley|Jude Law|Aaron Johnson|Kelly Macdonald|Matthew Macfadyen|Domhnall Gleeson|Ruth Wilson|Alicia Vikander|Olivia Williams|Emily Watson|","running_time":"130 minutes[1]","music_by":"Dario Marianelli","edited_by":"Melanie Ann Oliver","budget":"£31 million[2]"}
