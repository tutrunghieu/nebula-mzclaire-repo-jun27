In late 2002, producer Humbert Balsan authorized the US distributor of the film to release a statement which stated that Balsan had asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences if the film could run for best foreign language picture. According to Balsan, the answer was no, because \"Palestine is not a state we recognize in our rules.\" However, spokesperson John Pavlik states that the Academy had never made a decision on that issue because Suleiman had never submitted his film. Critics like The Electronic Intifada and others, claim that the Academy did make a decision, and that it was based on political considerations.[3]The film was considered for an Oscar the following year; Pavlik told Variety \"The committee decided to treat Palestine as an exception in the same way we treat Hong Kong as an exception. It's always the goal of the foreign-language film award executive committee to be as inclusive as possible.\"[4]","Awards":"The film screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival on May 12,[5] was awarded the Jury Prize[6] and the FIPRESCI Prize for \"its sensitive, amusing and innovative vision of a complex and topical situation and the tragic consequences that result from it\".[7]","Music":"Elia Suleiman has used entirely non-original music of various genres and artists in the film. These include artists such as the Belgian singer Natacha Atlas, Indian composer A.R. Rahman, Lebanese electro-pop band Soapkills and Paris-based record producer Mirwais Ahmadza√Ø.Track listing:","release_dates":"May 19, 2002","produced_by":"Humbert Balsan Elia Suleiman","starring":"Elia Suleiman Manal Khader","running_time":"92 minutes","written_by":"Elia Suleiman"}
