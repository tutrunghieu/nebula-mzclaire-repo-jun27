Witch Hunt takes place in the 1950s during the red scare, in which magic is substituted for communism. Dennis Hopper played Lovecraft in place of Fred Ward. Additionally, many characters have different background stories than in Cast a Deadly Spell. For example, Lovecraft refuses to use magic in Cast a Deadly Spell on principle, and because of a bad experience in Witch Hunt.","music_by":"Curt Sobel","External links":"","edited_by":"Dan Rae","written_by":"Joseph Dougherty","budget":"$6,000,000"}
