Fed up with the situation, she winds up running away for a while to Oregon, where she encounters a middle-aged married realtor (Bob Hope) who quickly becomes extremely anxious to explore their acquaintance further.","Reception":"With Bob Hope's film career on the downswing by the '60s, Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number! was critically panned and compared to a \"90-minute TV sitcom\".[6] The critic for the New York Times drew parallels with Up in Mabel's Room which Edward Small had made twenty years previously.[7] Reviews were poor.[8] However it performed well at the box office.
