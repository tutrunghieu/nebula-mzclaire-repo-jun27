The short, called \"A Cinderella Named Elizabeth,\" focuses on her status as an unknown actress from the middle America town of Youngstown, Ohio, and includes segments from her screen test and associated \"personality test\", in which the actress is filmed while being herself and answering questions about everyday topics such as her taste in clothing. The short also shows her visiting the Braille Institute of America to watch blind people being trained to do handwork — similar to the beadwork her character does in the film — and to perform tasks of daily living and self-care, of the sort that Poitier's character teaches Selina to do.[6]","music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith","edited_by":"Rita Roland","budget":"$800,000"}
