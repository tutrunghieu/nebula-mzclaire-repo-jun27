{"based_on":"Carrie  by Stephen King","country":"United States","distributed_by":"United Artists","screenplay_by":"Lawrence D. Cohen","Related productions":"Carrie, along with the novel, has been reproduced and adapted several times.The Rage: Carrie 2 was released in 1999. It featured another teenager with telekinetic powers who is revealed to have shared a father with Carrie White. The film received universally negative reviews and was a box office failure. Amy Irving reprises her role of Sue Snell from the previous film.In 2002, a television film based on King's novel and starring Angela Bettis in the titular role was released. The film updated the events of the story to modern-day settings and technology while simultaneously attempting to be more faithful to the book's original structure, storyline, and specific events. However, the ending was drastically changed: instead of killing her mother and then herself, the film has Carrie killing her mother, being revived via CPR by Sue Snell and being driven to Florida to hide. This new ending marked a complete divergence from the novel and was a signal that the film served as a pilot for a Carrie television series, which never materialized. In the new ending, the rescued Carrie vows to help others with similar gifts to her own. Although Bettis' portrayal of Carrie was highly praised, the film was cited by most critics as inferior to the original.[27]Early in the 21st century, playwright Erik Jackson attempted to secure the rights to stage another production of Carrie the musical, but his request was rejected. Jackson eventually earned the consent of King[28] to mount a new, officially-sanctioned, non-musical production of Carrie, which debuted Off-Broadway in 2006 with female impersonator Sherry Vine in the lead role.[29] Similarly, many other unofficial spoofs have been staged over the years, usually with a gym teacher named \"Miss Collins\" (as opposed to the novel's \"Miss Desjardin\" and the musical's \"Miss Gardner\"), most notably the \"parodage\" Scarrie the Musical,[30] which hit the Illinois stage in 1998 and was revived in 2005; Dad's Garage Theatre's 2002 production of Carrie White the Musical;[31] and the 2007 New Orleans production of Carrie's Facts of Life,[32] which was a hybrid of Carrie and the classic American sitcom The Facts of Life.In May 2011, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Screen Gems announced that Carrie would be adapted to film once more.[33] Playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa wrote the script as \"a more faithful adaptation\" of King's novel. Aguirre-Sacasa had previously adapted King's epic novel The Stand into comic-book form in 2008.The role of Carrie was played by 16-year-old actress Chloë Grace Moretz.[34] Julianne Moore starred as Carrie's mother Margaret White, and Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell.[35] Alex Russell and Broadway actor Ansel Elgort played Billy Nolan and Tommy Ross respectively.[36] Portia Doubleday was given the role of Chris Hargensen and Judy Greer was cast as Miss Desjardin.[37]Kimberly Peirce, known for her work on Boys Don't Cry, directed the new adaptation.[38] It was released October 18, 2013 and received mixed reviews.","carrie":"Original theatrical release poster","Plot":"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), a shy and friendless 17-year-old girl, is the scapegoat and outcast of her school. At home, she is abused by her mentally unstable mother Margaret (Piper Laurie), who is a Christian fundamentalist.While in the showers after gym class, Carrie unexpectedly experiences her first period and fears she is bleeding to death. The other girls, including Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) and Sue Snell (Amy Irving), add to her shame and humiliation by pelting her with tampons and sanitary pads, all of them chanting \"Plug it up!\" repeatedly. The gym teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) intervenes and as Carrie becomes more frantic, a light bulb suddenly bursts in the showers.Further examples of Carrie's telekinetic power are shown: when the school principal repeatedly calls her \"Cassie\" instead of \"Carrie\", an ashtray on his desk shakes and then spontaneously flips onto the floor; as Carrie walks home a cruel little boy on a bicycle named Bobby Erbter taunts her, repeatedly chanting \"Creepy Carrie\", but falls off his bike when Carrie glares at him; and when Margaret tells Carrie that the \"curse of blood\" is divine punishment for sin and forces her to pray for forgiveness. That night, a vengeful but miserable Carrie stares at her bedroom mirror until it shatters.Miss Collins punishes Carrie's P.E. class with a week-long detention, threatening the students with suspension from school and the prom if they do not attend. Chris becomes defiant and is coldly slapped by Miss Collins. Furious at her suspension, Chris storms out angrily swearing vengeance.Ashamed of her participation in Carrie's taunting, Sue persuades her handsome and charming boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to invite Carrie to the prom, but Carrie declines, fearing a trick. When Miss Collins asks Carrie what's wrong, Carrie reveals that Tommy asked her out. Miss Collins then convinces Carrie that she's beautiful and later warns Sue and Tommy that she will keep an eye on them to ensure that they don't taunt Carrie again despite Sue trying to convince her that they're trying to become her friends. Tommy later visits Carrie's house and repeats his invitation, which she eventually but happily accepts. Carrie tells her mother she is going to the prom, but Margaret declares the prom to be a sinful occasion. Carrie demonstrates her power by causing all the windows to slam shut, leading Margaret to believe she is a witch.Chris tells her delinquent boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) that she wants revenge on Carrie. He, Chris, and some friends go to a local farm and slaughter pigs and drain their blood into two buckets. Billy then sneaks into the school and place the buckets above the school's stage. At the prom, Chris' friend Norma (P.J. Soles) rigs the voting so that Carrie and Tommy are named prom king and queen. Sue then notices the bucket, she rushes to help Carrie. Before she can warn anyone, Miss Collins kicks her out, thinking she's jealous of Carrie becoming the queen of the prom. With Sue out of the way, Chris drenches Carrie in the pig's blood. Chris and Billy leave the gym laughing, as the fully humiliated Carrie hallucinates that everyone (including Miss Collins) is laughing at her.Immediately concerned, Tommy tries to help Carrie, but he is knocked unconscious by the bucket falling from the beam overhead before he can do anything. In revenge, Carrie telekinetically seals the exits and kills everyone as the horrified and helpless Chris and Billy watch from a window. Then Carrie calmly leaves the inferno and begins walking home, still covered in blood. Chris and Billy attempt to run her down in revenge, but Carrie telekinetically flips the car over and causes it to explode, killing them both.Upon returning home and taking a bath to wash off the pig's blood, Carrie prepares for bed, but encounters Margaret and breaks down in her arms. They recite the Lord's Prayer together, but halfway through, Margaret stabs Carrie in the back with a butcher's knife. Carrie falls down the stairs and is cornered in the kitchen by a crazed Margaret, who attempts to stab her again. Carrie sends all the kitchen knives and sharp objects hurtling into her mother, crucifying her in the doorway. The house starts to shake and then collapses around them as Carrie embraces her mother's body.Some time later, Sue, the sole survivor of the prom massacre, has a dream in which she visits the lot where Carrie's house once stood. As she places flowers on the ground, Carrie's bloody hand shoots out of the ground and grabs her elbow. Sue jolts awake in her own bed with her mother desperately trying to calm her.","language":"English","Release and reception":"Carrie received largely positive reviews and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1976.[12][13][14] The film currently holds a 92% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: \"Carrie is a horrifying look at supernatural powers, high school cruelty, and teen angst – and it brings us one of the most memorable and disturbing prom scenes in history.\"[15]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated the film was an \"absolutely spellbinding horror movie\", as well as an \"observant human portrait\", giving three and a half stars out of four.[16] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker stated that Carrie was \"the best scary-funny movie since Jaws – a teasing, terrifying, lyrical shocker\". Take One Magazine critic Susan Schenker said she was \"angry at the way Carrie manipulated me to the point where my heart was thudding, and embarrassed because the film really works.\"[17] A 1998 edition of The Movie Guide stated Carrie was a \"landmark horror film\", while Stephen Farber prophetically stated in a 1978 issue of New West Magazine, \"it's a horror classic, and years from now it will still be written and argued about, and it will still be scaring the daylights out of new generations of moviegoers.\"[18] Quentin Tarantino placed Carrie at number 8 in a list of his favorite films ever.[19]Nevertheless, the film was not without its detractors. Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice commented, \"There are so few incidents that two extended sequences are rendered in slow-motion as if to pad out the running time...\"[18]In addition to being a box office success - earning $14.5 million in theater rentals by January 1978[20] - Carrie is notable for being one of the few horror films to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie received nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards, respectively. The film also won the grand prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, while Sissy Spacek was given the Best Actress award by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2008, Carrie was ranked number 86 on Empire Magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[21] This movie also ranked number 15 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies, and No. 46 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Cinema Thrills, and was also ranked eighth for its famous ending sequence on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments (2004).[22]In a 2010 interview, King replied that he thought, although dated now, Carrie was a \"good movie.\"[4]","box_office":"$33.8 million[2]","cinematography":"Mario Tosi","directed_by":"Brian De Palma","release_dates":"November 3, 1976 (1976-11-03)|||||","Production":"Carrie was the first Stephen King novel to be published and the first to be adapted into a feature film. In an interview in Port Charlotte, Florida at a public appearance near his home on the Gulf coast on March 20, 2010, King said he was 26 years old at the time and was paid just $2,500 for the film rights, but added \"I was fortunate to have that happen to my first book.\"[4] De Palma told Cinefantastique magazine in an interview in 1977:\"I read the book. It was suggested to me by a writer friend of mine. A writer friend of his, Stephen King, had written it. I guess this was almost two years ago [circa 1975]. I liked it a lot and proceeded to call my agent to find out who owned it. I found out that nobody had bought it yet. A lot of studios were considering it, so I called around to some of the people I knew and said it was a terrific book and I'm very interested in doing it. Then nothing happened for, I guess, six months.\"[5]Lawrence D. Cohen was hired as the screenwriter, and produced the first draft, which had closely followed the novel's intentions.[6] United Artists accepted the second draft but only allocated De Palma a budget of $1.6 million, a small amount considering the popularity of horror films at the time. The budget eventually rose to $1.8 million.[7] Certain scripted scenes were omitted from the final version, mainly due to financial limitations.Many young actresses auditioned for the lead role, including Melanie Griffith. Sissy Spacek was persuaded by husband Jack Fisk to audition for the title role. Fisk then convinced De Palma to let her audition, and she read for all of the parts. De Palma's first choice for the role of Carrie was Betsy Slade, who received good notices for her role in the film Our Time (1974). Determined to land the leading role, Spacek backed out of a television commercial she was scheduled to film,[8] rubbed Vaseline into her hair, didn't bother to wash her face, and arrived for her screen test clad in a sailor dress which her mother had made her in the seventh grade, with the hem cut off,[5] and was given the part.Amy Irving was cast alongside her mother, Priscilla Pointer, who would play the mother of Irving's character.Nancy Allen was the last to audition, and her audition came just as she was on the verge of leaving Hollywood.[6] She and De Palma later married.De Palma began with director of photography Isidore Mankofsky, who was eventually replaced by Mario Tosi after conflict between Mankofsky and De Palma ensued.[9] Gregory M. Auer served as the special effects supervisor for Carrie, with Jack Fisk, Spacek's husband, as art director.The White house was filmed in Santa Paula, California and to give the home a Gothic theme, director and producers went to religious shops looking for artifacts to place in the home.The site of one of the locations where Carrie was filmed, Palisades Charter High School (\"Pali High\"), was owned by Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher - parents of Carrie Fisher - years before the school was built. Some years after the couple had purchased the lot, the State acquired the land by eminent domain (compulsory purchase) to build the school.A wraparound segment at the beginning and end of the film was scripted and filmed which featured the Whites' home being pummeled by stones that hailed from the sky. The opening scene was filmed as planned, though on celluloid, the tiny pebbles looked like rain water.[6] A mechanical malfunction botched production the night when the model of the Whites' home was set to be destroyed, so they burned it down instead and dropped the scenes with the stones altogether. The original opening scene is presumed lost.[6]The final scene, in which Sue reaches toward Carrie's grave, was shot backwards to give it a dreamlike quality. This scene was inspired by the final scene in Deliverance (1972).[6] Spacek had insisted on using her own hand in the given scene, so she was positioned under the rocks and gravel. De Palma stated, \"Sissy, come on, I'll get a stunt person. What do you want? To be buried in the ground?!\" However, Spacek declared, \"Brian, I have to do this.\" De Palma explains that they \"had to bury her. Bury her! We had to put her in a box and stick her underneath the ground. Well, I had her husband bury her because I certainly didn't want to bury her. I used to walk around and set up the shot and every once in a while we'd hear Sissy: 'Are we ready yet?' 'Yeah, Sissy, we're going to be ready real soon.'\"The score for Carrie was composed by Pino Donaggio. In addition, Donaggio scored two pop songs (\"Born to Have It All\" and \"I Never Dreamed Someone Like You Could Love Someone Like Me\") with lyrics by Merrit Malloy for the early portion of the prom sequence. These songs were performed by Katie Irving (no relation to star Amy Irving and her mother, Priscilla Pointer). Donaggio would work again with De Palma on Home Movies, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out, Body Double, Raising Cain, and Passion.The other songs were uncredited in the film and omitted from all album releases due to different ownership. These songs are \"(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave\" by Martha and the Vandellas, \"Education Blues\" by Vance or Towers, and a third song called \"Lady Lay\", which is also presumed to be by Vance or Towers (it was co-written by the band's Michael Towers[10])Additionally, two brief musical interludes during the prom (\"Pre-Prom Disco\" and \"Ernest's Announcement\") were also written by the same songwriting team who wrote \"Lady Lay\"[10] and have never been issued.The soundtrack album was originally released on vinyl in 1976 under the United Artists label. It was also released on cassette tape at some time during the 1970s or 1980s. A deluxe CD edition containing a few tracks of dialogue from the film was released by MGM/Rykodisc in 1997, and a 2005 CD re-release of the original soundtrack (minus dialogue) was available from Varèse Sarabande. Huge portions of the film's score were omitted from all of these releases. A bootleg version of the isolated score ripped from the Criterion laserdisc has also been in circulation on the internet.In 2010, Kritzerland Records released all 35 cues of Donaggio's score for the film on a two-disc CD set which was boasted as the complete score. Also included in this edition were the versions of \"Born to Have It All\" and \"I Never Dreamed...\" which were heard in the film, as well as instrumentals of both songs, and hidden at the end of the final track, a version of the \"Calisthenics\" cue with Betty Buckley's studio-recorded voiceover from the detention scene. The second disc was a remastered copy of the original 13-track album. The Kritzerland release was a limited edition of 1200 copies. Kritzerland re-released the first disc as \"The Encore Edition\" in February 2013; this release was limited to 1,000 copies.[11]","produced_by":"Paul Monash","starring":"Sissy Spacek|John Travolta|Piper Laurie|","running_time":"98 minutes[1]","music_by":"Pino Donaggio","edited_by":"Paul Hirsch","budget":"$1.8 million"}
