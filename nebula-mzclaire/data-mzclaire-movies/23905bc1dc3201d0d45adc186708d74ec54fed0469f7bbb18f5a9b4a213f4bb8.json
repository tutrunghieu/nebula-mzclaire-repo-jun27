{"country":"South Korea","distributed_by":"CJ Entertainment","Plot":"In the late 1960s, C'est si bon was the music lounge every unknown acoustic band dreamed of playing, and where Korea's leading folk musicians were born. It is where Geun-tae, a naïve country boy, meets musical prodigies and rivals Hyung-joo and Chang-sik. Together they form a band and name themselves after the iconic venue — the C'est si bon Trio. As the three young musicians bicker over their music, beautiful socialite Ja-young enters the picture and becomes their muse, launching a series of moving love songs. Ja-young falls for the pure-hearted Geun-tae, but they part ways when she accepts a once-in-lifetime shot at an acting career. 20 years later in the 1990s, Geun-tae and Ja-young meet again.","language":"Korean","Reception":"C'est si bon was released in South Korea on February 5, 2015.
