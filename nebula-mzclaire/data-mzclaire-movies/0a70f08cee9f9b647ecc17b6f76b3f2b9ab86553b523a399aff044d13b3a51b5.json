He is developing an engine that runs on wheatgrass with no results until he accidentally cuts his finger and the blood falls in the wheatgrass, which filters to the engine and then causes it to run.Andrews then tests his car out and offers a ride to Denise, who runs a meat stand and is a rival to Lorraine. After Denise expresses an interest in Archie (believing he can afford 30+ dollars a gallon gasoline), he drives her home, but runs out of fuel. Archie turns to hunting animals, but they do not provide sufficient blood. He turns to larger prey such as predatory people, and eventually, settles for any victim after rebuilding a more efficient blood engine.The government, which has been tracking Archie's progress, eventually offers him any position he wants, provided he can create more \"Blood Cars\" after the original is destroyed, and his existence is erased. Archie is concerned where the fuel for the new cars will come from, and the federal agents promise him it will come from invalids, convicted criminals, and the homeless. Archie agrees. Images of Archie's rise as President are cut with the government agents murdering Lorraine, Denise, his kindergarten students, and anyone that saw him developing the Blood Car.","language":"English","production_company":"Fake Wood Wallpaper Films","directed_by":"Alex Orr","blood_car":"Poster","Award":"Blood Car was winner of the New Visions Award at the 2007 Cinequest Film Festival.[5] Winner - Best Narrative Feature Film at the 2007 Chicago Underground Film Festival Winner - Best Feature Narrative Film at the 2007 Philadelphia FirstGlance Film Festival Winner - Best Narrative Feature Film Award at the 2007 Atlanta Underground Film Festival Winner - Audience Award 2007 Faux Film Festival Winner - Best Feature â€“ 2007 Backseat Film Festival","release_dates":"2007","starring":"Anna Chlumsky, Katie Rowlett, Mike Brune","running_time":"76 minutes","written_by":"Hugh Braselton, Alex Orr","budget":"$25,000"}
