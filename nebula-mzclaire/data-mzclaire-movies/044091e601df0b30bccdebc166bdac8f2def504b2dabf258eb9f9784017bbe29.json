{"country":"Israel","Plot":"The story takes place in the high-security block of the central Israel Prison Service jail. Uri and Issam are the leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian prisoner groups, respectively. After a musical performance in the prison, a row breaks out between Hoffman, a Jewish inmate, and a Palestinian. When Hoffman is killed, the security officer initiates a fight between the sides, pinning the blame for the murder on Issam's cell. Doron, the only Jewish prisoner in the Arab cell, is asked to sign a document implicating Issam in the crime, but refuses and commits suicide. He leaves a note saying that his cell was not responsible for the crime. As a result, Uri and Issam begin a general hunger strike, and make personal sacrifices in order not to break it.","language":"Hebrew","box_office":"$400,000[1]","cinematography":"Amnon Salomon","directed_by":"Uri Barbash","release_dates":"15 February 1985 (1985-02-15) (USA)|||||","produced_by":"Rudy Cohen Katriel Schori","starring":"Arnon Zadok Mohammed Bakri Assi Dayan Rami Danon","running_time":"103 minutes","music_by":"Ilan Virtzberg","edited_by":"Tova Asher","written_by":"Benny Barbash Uri Barbash Eran Preis"}
