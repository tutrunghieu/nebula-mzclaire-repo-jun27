{"country":"United States","distributed_by":"IMAX Corporation National Air and Space Museum","language":"English","Synopsis":"Cosmic Voyage takes on a similar format as the National Film Board of Canada's Cosmic Zoom, and IBM's classic Powers of Ten educational video. All based on the book Cosmic View by Kees Boeke. The film takes viewers on a journey through forty-two orders of magnitude, beginning at a celebration in Italy to zoom to the edge of the observable universe. The view descends back to earth, and later zooms in upon a raindrop on a leaf, to the level of subatomic particles (quarks).In addition, the film offers some brief insight on the Big Bang theory, black holes, and the development of our Solar System. It also simulates a journey through Fermilab's Tevatron particle accelerator in Chicago, where an atom collision is depicted.","production_company":"Cosmic Voyage Inc.","directed_by":"Bayley Silleck","Awards":"Cosmic Voyage was nominated for a 1997 Academy Award under the category of Best Documentary Short Subject.[2]","narrated_by":"Morgan Freeman","release_dates":"1996","produced_by":"Jeffrey Marvin Bayley Silleck","running_time":"36 minutes","music_by":"David Michael Frank","written_by":"Michael Miner Bayley Silleck"}
