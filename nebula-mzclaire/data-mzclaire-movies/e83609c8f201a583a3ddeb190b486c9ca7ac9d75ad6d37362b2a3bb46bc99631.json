{"based_on":"A Time to Kill  by John Grisham","country":"United States","distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","screenplay_by":"Akiva Goldsman","Plot":"Two white supremacists (Nicky Katt and Doug Hutchison) come across a ten-year-old black girl named Tonya (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly) in rural Mississippi. They violently rape and beat Tonya and dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her; she survives, and the men are arrested.Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), contacts Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey), a white lawyer. Brigance admits the possibility that the rapists will walk free. Carl Lee goes to the county courthouse and opens fire with a 5.56mm M-16 full-automatic rifle, killing both rapists and unintentionally injuring Deputy Looney (Chris Cooper). Carl Lee is arrested. Brigance agrees to defend Carl Lee.The rape and subsequent revenge killing gain national media attention. The Ku Klux Klan begins to organize in the area. Freddie Lee Cobb (Kiefer Sutherland), the brother of Billy Ray, calls Brigance and makes death threats and escalating, supportive acts of violence. The district attorney, Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey), decides to seek the death penalty, and presiding Judge Omar Noose (Patrick McGoohan) denies Brigance a change of venue. Brigance seeks help from his defense team, law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), close friend Harry Rex Vonner (Oliver Platt), and former mentor and long-time liberal activist Lucien Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland), a once-great civil rights lawyer.During closing arguments, Brigance tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the rape of a young 10-year-old girl, recalling the story of Tonya's rape. He then asks the jury, in his final comment, to \"now imagine she's white.\" The statement implies that, had the defendant been white, the father's motive in murdering the rapists would have been seen by the public as justified, and there would have been no prosecution. It also implies that if the jury can — at any time — be compelled to spare the life of a white man for a vengeful murder, then they must do the same for a black man.After deliberation, an African-American child runs out of the courthouse and screams, \"He's innocent!\" Jubilation ensues amongst the supporters outside. The Klan, enraged, begins yelling in anger. Meanwhie Sheriff Ozzie Walls manages to arrest Freddie Lee for his crimes, as well as a corrupted deputy that was by Freddie's side.The movie ends when Brigance brings his wife and daughter to a family cookout at Carl Lee's house to celebrate Carl´s freedom.","language":"English","Reception":"According to Boxofficemojo.com, the movie performed well, earning over $108 million domestically.The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, earning a 67% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews,[3] a critical consensus reading: \"Overlong and superficial, A Time to Kill nonetheless succeeds on the strength of its skillful craftsmanship and top-notch performances\". It has a score of 54 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 21 reviews.[4]Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying: \"I was absorbed by A Time to Kill, and found the performances strong and convincing,\" and added that \"this is the best of the film versions of Grisham novels, I think, and it has been directed with skill by Joel Schumacher.\"[5]The film was not without its detractors, however. Anthony Puccinelli gave the film one star, calling it \"worthless\" and remarking: \"A Time to Kill argues for vigilantism but disguises its message by making the vigilante black, allowing viewers to think their blood lust and thirst for revenge is actually empathy for the oppressed.\"[6] Peter Travers felt that \"they [Schumacher and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman] cram[med] in too much,\" adding, \"This distracts from the heart of the picture, which is in the bond between Carl Lee (the brilliant [Samuel L.] Jackson is quietly devastating) and Jake, a husband and father who knows he, too, would have shot anyone who raped his little girl.\"[7] Gene Siskel remarked it was \"An overwrought, contrived courtroom thriller\", \"cornball\" and concluded \"This story has been recycled out of countless better movies.\"Grisham enjoyed the film, remarking: \"When all was said and done I was happy with it, happy we were able to find a kid like Matthew McConaughey. It wasn't a great movie, but it was a good one.\"[8]In France, the film has been the subject of much controversy. Critics have accused the movie of making an apology for the death penalty and right of self-defense. A question mark was added at the end of the title (\"Le Droit de tuer ?\"/\"The Right to Kill ?\"[9][10]) so as not to shock the audience. Amnesty International France uses the word \"disturbing\" when referring to the film in one of its documents.[11][not in citation given] Les Inrockuptibles described the film as \"nauseating\", \"stinking\", almost \"fascist\", with a script \"ultra-populist\" that makes you want to \"vomit\".[12] Libération criticized the script, calling it \"extremely dirty\": the movie, says the newspaper, \"militates in favour of the black cause only to legitimize, after many plot buckles (resurrection of the Ku Klux Klan, the deceits of court, threats of [m]any kinds) the mentally ill gesture of the avenging father\". According to Libération, the movie \"justifies the indefensible\" with a \"dripping sentimentalism\".[13]","box_office":"$152 million[1]","cinematography":"Peter Menzies Jr.","production_company":"Regency Enterprises","directed_by":"Joel Schumacher","Soundtrack":"Elliot Goldenthal scored the film.
