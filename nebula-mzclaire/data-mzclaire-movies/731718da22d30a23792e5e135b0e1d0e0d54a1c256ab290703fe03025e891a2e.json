The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 192 reviews.[9] Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 38 reviews.[10]Jolie's performance was widely touted by top critics as her finest artistic achievement to date. Both she and the film received a positive review from Roger Ebert.[11] The film was described by Newsweek as \"a movie without melodrama or movie-star lighting…allowing Jolie to deliver the most delicate, powerful and human-scale performance of her career.\"[12] Other favorable reviewers included Peter Travers of Rolling Stone,[13] Justin Chang of Variety[14] and Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter.[4] Marc Mohan of The Oregonian named it the 10th best film of 2007.[15]However, Andrew O'Hehir, film critic for Salon.com, while finding Jolie's performance \"restrained and dignified\", dismissed the film itself, writing, \"it feels like an extra-long episode of 24 with a bad conscience and a bad ending.\"[16] Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum felt that Jolie's celebrity was a problem, commenting that \"Despite the best of intentions, an actress who makes her own headlines gets in the way of the big picture.\"[17]Asra Nomani—a colleague of Daniel Pearl who had agreed to participate in the film—stated that the film failed to portray Pearl as a journalist, doing his job, in favor of creating a dramatic arc of \"ordinary heroes\". She believes Pearl would have \"rolled his eyes\" at that description. Describing her own response to the film, Nomani said, \"For me, watching the movie was like having people enter my home, rearrange the furniture and reprogram my memory.\"[18]The announcement of the casting of Angelina Jolie in the role of Mariane Pearl drew criticism within the African American community.[19] Orville Lloyd Douglas, a pop critic, has criticized the casting[20] because, he said, \"Jolie is white\" and Mariane Pearl is \"mixed race\". In fact, Pearl is the multi-racial daughter of a Dutch-Jewish father and an Afro-Chinese-Cuban mother.[16][21][22] Pearl personally chose Jolie to play the lead in A Mighty Heart.[23] In response to casting complaints, Pearl said \"I have heard some criticism about her casting, but it is not about the color of your skin. It is about who you are. I asked her to play the role—even though she is way more beautiful than I am—because I felt a real kinship to her. She put her whole heart into it, and I think she understood why we should do this movie. We had something to say that we knew we should say together.\"[23]","box_office":"$18,935,657","cinematography":"Marcel Zyskind","directed_by":"Michael Winterbottom","Box office performance":"A Mighty Heart performed poorly at the box office, only earning a total revenue of $18 million compared to its production budget of $16 million.[7] The film opened June 22, 2007 in the United States and Canada and grossed $3.9 million in 1,355 theaters its opening weekend, ranking #10 at the box office.
