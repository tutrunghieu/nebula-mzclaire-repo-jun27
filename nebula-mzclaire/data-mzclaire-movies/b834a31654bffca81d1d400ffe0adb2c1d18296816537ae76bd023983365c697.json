Originally darker than the final product, the movie's original length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given special edition DVD releases on the same day as the Batman Begins DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.[31]There was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents death that he hadn't faced which was finding his fathers diary on the night of his parents wake and reading that Bruce insisted his parents go to the theater so he could watch one of the shows, meaning the reason he became Batman was out of the guilt that he killed them.Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film, others scenes had footage removed. These included:","Plot":"In Gotham City, Batman stops a hostage situation caused by Two-Face, the alter ego of the former district attorney Harvey Dent, but Two-Face evades capture and escapes. Edward Nygma, a researcher at Wayne Enterprises, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce Wayne, whom Nygma idolizes, rejects the invention believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley and making his death seem like a suicide, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him riddles. Bruce goes to meet the Batman-obsessed psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian for any ideas on the mindset of the person sending them and invites her to come to a big circus charity event event happening in town with him. At the circus, Two-Face and his men arrive disguised as clowns and threaten to blow up the circus unless Batman is surrendered to him then and there within so many minutes. The performers of the circus, The Flying Graysons, attempt to get the bomb away as its dangling from the ceiling. While they do so, Two-Face notices this and severs their trapeze, causing them to fall to their death (the circus had disabled safety nets prior to the interruption in preparation of the grand finale). Dick Grayson, the youngest member, is spared this fate as he managed to get the bomb to the roof and throw it in the nearby river.Bruce invites the orphaned Dick to stay at Wayne Manor. Dick intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family murder. While Bruce visits Chase Dick secretly follows Alfred and discovers the batcave where he hijacks the batmobile. When Dick learns that Bruce is Batman, he wants to be his sidekick and have Batman help him track down Two-Face so he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma becomes a criminal called the Riddler and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two engage in robberies in order to raise capital for Nygma to mass produce his brainwave device. At a business party promoting Nygmatech, Nygma discovers Batman's secret identity using the mind device. Two-Face crashes the party and after getting Batman to follow him nearly kills him in a subway explosion but Dick arrives, masked wearing his Flying Grayson costume and helps pull Bruce from the wreckage. Meanwhile, Chase's love for Bruce surpasses her obsession with Batman, as he goes to see her as Batman she tells him she now is in love with Bruce and later goes to the manor for dinner. Bruce decides to stop being Batman after recently struggling with why he has to be Batman, and now wants to stop so that Dick cant find and kill Two-Face and become a crime-fighter without a normal life. Dick runs away as Bruce and Chase have dinner at the manor together with Chase wanting to confess her feelings for Bruce. The Riddler and Two-Face attack Wayne Manor and destroy the Batcave. They kidnap Chase, while leaving an injured Bruce another riddle. Bruce regains consciousness and with Alfred he studies all the assorted riddles and discovers the Riddler's identity. He uses the prototype Batsuit that wasn't destroyed in the batcaves explosion and Dick returns in a suit of his own calling himself Robin. Bruce agrees that they are partners and together go to Two-Face and Riddler's lair, Claw Island, where both are separated. Robin finds Two-Face and nearly kills him knocking him down the edge of a cliff. Realizing that he cannot murder, Robin saves Two-Face, who pulls a gun on him and captures Robin. Batman manages to make his way into the Riddler's lair, where Robin and Chase are both held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to only save one hostage. Batman with a batarang destroys the brainwave-collecting device and manages to save both hostages. Two-Face flips his coin to determine Batman's fate, but Batman throws identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to fall to his death. The Riddler is sent to Arkham Asylum, but he claims that he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe. Batman and Robin continue to protect Gotham City from crime with Batman being Batman not because he has to be because he chooses to be.","language":"English","box_office":"$336.5 million[1]","cinematography":"Stephen Goldblatt","directed_by":"Joel Schumacher","production_companies":"Tim Burton Productions PolyGram Pictures","release_dates":"June 9, 1995 (1995-06-09) (Mann Village Theater)|June 16, 1995 (1995-06-16) (United States)||||","Production":"Even though Batman Returns was a financial success, Warner Bros. felt the film should have made more money and decided to make the film series more mainstream. Tim Burton, who had directed the two previous installments, was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer and signed Joel Schumacher as director.[4] After approving Schumacher as director, Burton met with Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, who agreed with him that \"the key element to Batman is his duality. And it's not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne\".[5] Burton along with Schumacher hired the Batchlers to write the script which introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be \"lighte[ne]d down\". Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One. The studio rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's past. He hired Akiva Goldsman—with whom he previously had worked with on The Client—to write the second draft of the script.[6]Production went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Dr. Chase Meridian but Michael Keaton decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the new direction the film series was heading in.[7] Keaton also wanted to pursue \"more interesting roles\",[8] turning down $15 million to appear in Batman Forever.[9] Val Kilmer was cast days later, and the filmmakers decided that Russo was too old for Kilmer, replacing her with a different actress.[7] Schumacher became interested in Kilmer for Batman after seeing him in Tombstone, and the actor accepted the role without even reading the script or knowing who the new director was.[10] Before Val Kilmer was cast, Daniel Day-Lewis, Ralph Fiennes, William Baldwin and Johnny Depp were all under consideration to replace Michael Keaton.[11][citation needed] Ethan Hawke turned down the role over fear of typecasting, but later regretted the decision.[12]Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton were in competition for Dr. Chase Meridian, with Wright appearing as the favorable choice. Nicole Kidman was eventually cast.[13] Billy Dee Williams took on the role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role.[14] Jones was always Schumacher's first choice, after having worked with him on The Client. Jones claims he was sent the script and was very cautious to accept,[6] but did so after his son's insistence.[15] Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point.[16][17] In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast.[18] Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted due to too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for Batman Forever. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor.[19] Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to go the role after a meeting with Schumacher.[20] Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double.[13] Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.[21]Filming started in September 1994.[4] Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a \"force\" and felt Ling could \"advance on it\". Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be in any way connected to the previous films, and instead was to be inspired by the images from the Batman comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a \"city with personality\", with more statues, as well as various amounts of neon.Schumacher had problems filming with Kilmer, whom he described as \"childish and impossible\", reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher during two weeks after the director told him to stop behaving in a rude way.[22] Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: \"Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I'm tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don't work with them again.\"[23] Carrey later acknowledged Jones was not friendly to him, telling him once off-set during the production, \"I hate you. I really don't like you ... I cannot sanction your buffoonery.\" [24]Rick Baker designed the prosthetic makeup. John Dykstra, Andrew Adamson and Jim Rygiel served as visual effects supervisors, with Pacific Data Images also contributing to visual effects work. PDI provided a computer-generated Batman for complicated stunts.[25] For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batman's costume was redesigned along the lines of a more \"MTV organic, and edgier feel\" to the suit.[26] Sound editing and mixing was co-supervised by Bruce Stambler and John Levesque, which included trips to caves to record bat sounds.[27] A new Batmobile was designed for Batman Forever, with two cars being constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close-ups with both showcasing a V8 engine.[28] Swiss surrealist painter H.R. Giger provided his version for the Batmobile but it was considered too sinister for the film.Elliot Goldenthal was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written, whereas most composers are hired during production. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from Danny Elfman, and requested an original composition.[29] The film's promotional teaser trailer used the main title theme from Elfman's score of 1989's Batman.[30]The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as Prince's soundtrack to the 1989 Batman film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie'. Hit singles from the soundtrack include \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\" by U2 and \"Kiss from a Rose\" by Seal, both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. \"Kiss from a Rose\" (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by The Flaming Lips, Brandy (both songs also included in the film), Method Man, Nick Cave, Michael Hutchence (of INXS), PJ Harvey, and Massive Attack, was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more \"pop\".","produced_by":"Tim Burton|Peter MacGregor-Scott|","starring":"Val Kilmer|Tommy Lee Jones|Jim Carrey|Nicole Kidman|Chris O'Donnell|Michael Gough|Pat Hingle|","running_time":"122 minutes","music_by":"Elliot Goldenthal","edited_by":"Dennis Virkler|Mark Stevens|","Release":"Batman Forever opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.8 million in its opening weekend,[1] breaking Jurassic Park's record for highest opening weekend gross of all-time (it was surpassed two years later by The Lost World: Jurassic Park's $72.1 million).[32] The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million. The film earned more money than its predecessor Batman Returns,[33] and was the second-highest (behind Toy Story) grossing film of 1995, in the U.S.[32]On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 41%, based on 58 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, \"Loud, excessively busy, and often boring, Batman Forever nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief.\"[34] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[35]Peter Travers said \"Batman Forever still gets in its licks. There's no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises.\" However, he criticized the film's excessive commercialism and felt that \"the script misses the pain Tim Burton caught in a man tormented by the long-ago murder of his parents.\"[36] Brian Lowry of Variety believed \"One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber batsuit. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, Alfred's? Some of the computer-generated Gotham cityscapes appear too obviously fake. Elliot Goldenthal's score, while serviceable, also isn't as stirring as Danny Elfman's work in the first two films.\"[37]James Berardinelli enjoyed the film. \"It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before.\"[38] Scott Beatty felt \"Tommy Lee Jones played Harvey Dent as a Joker knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue.\"[39] Lee Bermejo called Batman Forever \"unbearable\".[40] Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down.[41] In his written review, Ebert wrote: \"Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke.\"[42] Mick LaSalle had a mixed reaction, concluding \"a shot of Kilmer's rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience.\"[43]At the 68th Academy Awards, Batman Forever was nominated for Cinematography (lost to Braveheart), Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Frank A. Montaño, Michael Herbick and Petur Hliddal; lost to Apollo 13) and Sound Editing (John Leveque and Bruce Stambler) (also lost to Braveheart).[44] \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\" by U2 was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (lost to \"Colors of the Wind\" from Pocahontas), but was also nominated for the Worst Original Song Golden Raspberry Award (lost to \"Walk Into the Wind\" from Showgirls). At the Saturn Awards, the film was nominated for Best Fantasy Film (lost to Babe), Make-up (lost to Seven), Special Effects (lost to Jumanji) and Costume Design (lost to 12 Monkeys). Composer Elliot Goldenthal was given a Grammy Award nomination. Batman Forever received six nominations at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards, four of which were divided between two categories (Carrey and Lee Jones for Best Villain; and Seal's \"Kiss from a Rose\" and U2's \"Hold Me\" in Best Song from a Movie). However, it won in just one category—Best Song from a Movie for Seal's \"Kiss from a Rose\".In addition to a large line of toys and action figures from Kenner, the McDonald's food chain released several collectibles and mugs to coincide with the release of the film. Peter David and Alan Grant wrote separate novelizations of the film.[45][46] Dennis O'Neil authored a comic book adaptation, with art by Michal Dutkiewicz.[47]Six Flags Great Adventure theme park re-themed their \"Axis Chemical\" arena, home of the Batman stunt show, to resemble \"Batman Forever\", and the new show featured props from the film. Because of the mostly negative critical reaction however, the stunt arena was changed back to its original version after the season. Six Flags Over Texas featured a one-time fireworks show to promote the movie, and replica busts of Batman, Robin, Two-Face, and the Riddler can still be found in the Justice League store in the Looney Tunes U.S.A. section.","batman_forever":"Theatrical release poster by John Alvin","budget":"$100 million[1]"}
