She falls in love with Pakistani Heart Surgeon, Dr Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews). The film depicts her historic tours of Angola, in her campaign against the use of land mines. Trips to causes in Australia, Pakistan, New York City, Bosnia, Italy and ultimately Paris, are also shown, with recreations of the fashions she wore in real life. Her desire for a life with Khan ends due to his wish for a private life and objections to her celebrity.
