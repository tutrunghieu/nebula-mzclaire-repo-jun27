Roger Ebert called the film \"a textbook example of a movie going wrong before our very eyes.\"[1]Oldman's performance is generally regarded as one of the worst of his career.[2] The film marks his first use of an American accent, which was derided by many critics for rendering his dialogue \"forced and stilted\".[2] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave a scathing appraisal of the performance, writing: \"Oldman is a powerhouse...But what's a British actor doing playing a Harvard attorney in a Boston-based movie shot in Montreal? Flailing about like a drowning man, that's what. Oldman's [accent is] laughably in-and-out\". He added that \"Bacon delivers the film's one modulated performance\", while \"Oldman rants hysterically\".[3]","box_office":"$9,974,446","directed_by":"Martin Campbell","release_dates":"April 28, 1989 (1989-04-28)|||||","produced_by":"Hilary Heath Robert MacLean","starring":"Gary Oldman|Kevin Bacon|Tess Harper|Karen Young|Joe Don Baker|","running_time":"117 min.","music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith","External links":"","written_by":"Mark Kasdan"}
