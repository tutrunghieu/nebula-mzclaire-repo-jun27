{"country":"United States","distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","Plot":"After escaping from jail where they had \"one more week to serve,\" Laurel and Hardy travel to Scotland as stowaways on a cattle boat, where Laurel (as \"Stanley McLaurel\") believes he is heir to his grandfather's fortune. As it turns out, Laurel has only been bequeathed a set of bagpipes and a snuff container).Use of the latter causes Hardy, trying to demonstrate to Laurel the proper way to use snuff, to fly off an old bridge. His clothes are soaked.In the boarding house, Laurel swaps their overcoats for a large fish for dinner. In quick succession the fish \"shrizzles\" to about 1/10 its size, Hardy's pants are burnt and ruined, and an attempt to hide the still-hot stove results in the landlady throwing the two out and confiscating their luggage for non-payment of rent. Receiving an ad for a tailor's offer of a new suit, Laurel and Hardy accidentally go to the wrong floor and join a Scottish regiment of the British army and travel to India, where they frequently run afoul of their Sergeant Major (Jimmy Finlayson), and help their friend Alan (William Janney) reunite with his love (and Laurel's cousin) Lorna McLaurel (June Lang).","language":"English","cinematography":"Art Lloyd Walter Lundin","bonnie_scotland":"Theatrical poster","directed_by":"James W.
