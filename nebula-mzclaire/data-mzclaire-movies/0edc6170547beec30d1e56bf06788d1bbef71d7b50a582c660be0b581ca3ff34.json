{"country":"Switzerland France","Plot":"Jo is a twenty-five-year-old music composer. He has come over from Berlin and wants to be part of the nascent electronic music revolution, ideally by getting a job first as a DJ in the new nightclub on the island, Amnesia. Martha has been living alone in her house facing the sea for forty years. One night Jo knocks on her door. Her solitude intrigues him. They become friends even as the mysteries around her accumulate: that cello in the corner she refuses to play, the German language she refuses to speak... Slowly, they enter into a relationship that will challenge and change both of them.","language":"English","cinematography":"Luciano Tovoli","directed_by":"Barbet Schroeder","amnesia":"Cannes poster","release_dates":"May 2015 (2015-05) (Cannes)|19 August 2015 (2015-08-19) (France)||||","produced_by":"Ruth Waldburger Margaret Menegoz","starring":"Marthe Keller Max Riemelt","running_time":"96 minutes","music_by":"Lucien Nicolet","edited_by":"Nelly Quettier","written_by":"Emilie Bickerton Peter Steinbach Susan Hoffman Barbet Schroeder"}
