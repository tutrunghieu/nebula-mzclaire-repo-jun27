{"distributed_by":"Gaumont (France) Columbia TriStar (US)","language":"French","Critical reception":"Pauline Kael reviews the film favourably in her collection of movie reviews, State of the Art:Julia Migenes-Johnson's freckled, gamine Carmen is the chief glory of the production. Her strutting, her dark, messy, frizzy hair—her sexual availability—attract Don José and drive him crazy. Carmen, who's true to her instincts, represents everything he tries to repress. But after he has deserted the Army and lost the respectability that meant everything to him, he thinks she owes him lifelong devotion. Carmen's mistake was in thinking she could take him as a lover on her own terms.[3]","directed_by":"Francesco Rosi","Home media":"In late 2011 the film was released on both a regular, anamorphically enhanced Region 1 DVD, and on Blu-ray.","release_dates":"14 March 1984 (1984-03-14)|||||","Production":"Rosi selected 1875 for the period and filmed entirely on locations in Andalusia, using Ronda and Carmona and Seville itself to simulate the Seville of that era.[2] He worked with his longtime collaborator, the cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, and with Enrico Job supervising the sets and costumes. Rosi acknowledged Gustave Doré's illustrations for Baron Charles Davilliers Spain (which was published in serial form in 1873) as his principal source for the visual design.[citation needed] He believed that Bizet, who never visited Spain, was guided by these engravings, and shot scenes in some of the exact places that Doré drew.[citation needed]","produced_by":"Patrice Ledoux","starring":"Julia Migenes Plácido Domingo Ruggero Raimondi Faith Esham","running_time":"152 minutes","music_by":"Georges Bizet","External links":"","written_by":"Henri Meilhac Ludovic Halévy Francesco Rosi Tonino Guerra"}
