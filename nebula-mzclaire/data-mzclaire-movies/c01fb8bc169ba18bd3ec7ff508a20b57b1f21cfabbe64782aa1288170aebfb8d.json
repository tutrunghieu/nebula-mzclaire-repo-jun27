{"country":"United Kingdom|Spain|","distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","28_weeks_later":"Theatrical release poster","Plot":"During the original outbreak of the Rage Virus, Don, his wife Alice, and four other survivors hide in a barricaded cottage on the outskirts of London. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door, and let him in. A few minutes later, they discover that the infected have followed the boy to them. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors, while Don, Alice, and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice to abandon the boy, but she refuses. He abandons them as the infected break into their room by busting out of the window. Don desperately sprints to a nearby motorboat, narrowly escaping after a tussle with a recently turned survivor.After the infected begin to die of starvation, NATO forces take control of Great Britain. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American-led force, under the command of Brigadier General Stone, brings in settlers. Among the new arrivals are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy, who were out of the country at a refugee camp during the outbreak. They are admitted to District One, a safe zone on the Isle of Dogs guarded by the U.S. Army. Sergeant Doyle, a U.S. Delta Force Sniper and his friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter pilot, are amongst the military presence in charge of guarding the district. Tammy and Andy are reunited with their father, who was found by the U.S. Army and has become the district's caretaker. In their new flat, Don fabricates a lie about their mother, Alice's, death in order to conceal his cowardice.That night, Andy dreams about forgetting his mother's face, so Tammy and Andy sneak out of the safe zone, and return to their former home, where they begin to collect family photographs and other mementos. To his shock, Andy finds Alice alive and uninfected in a semi-conscious, delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where she is tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the rage virus. Don makes an unauthorised visit to Alice in her isolation cell, begging her to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him. However, when they kiss, Don is infected, savagely kills her, and goes on a rampage.General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and District One to be put into Code Red lockdown. Civilians are herded into safe rooms, but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room containing a large crowd and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The mob - now with half its members infected - breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy, and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. General Stone orders District One to be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but he refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who are possibly infected.Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to head to Wembley Stadium, but to leave the civilians. Doyle ignores his instructions and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape nerve gas released to kill the infected, but are unable to drive away due to corpses jamming the wheels as soldiers intending to light the gas with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits out of the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the car and is simultaneously roasted alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the London Underground, where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy. Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the English Channel to France, as previously instructed by Doyle.Twenty-eight days later, a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen running through a tunnel which, as they emerge into the open, is revealed to be the exit of the Paris Métro Trocadéro station with a view of the nearby Eiffel Tower.","language":"English","Reception":"28 Weeks Later gained generally positive reviews.[18] The film has generated a \"fresh\" rating of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 187 reviews (132 fresh, 55 rotten).[19] View London called the film an \"exciting, action-packed and superbly directed thriller that more than lives up to the original film\".[20] The New York Times's A.

We saw an opportunity to make a second film that already had a built in audience. We thought it would be a great idea to try and satisfy that audience again.In 2003, plans for the film were conceived after the international success of 28 Days Later. Danny Boyle, Andrew Macdonald and Alex Garland stated that they felt the time was right to make a sequel.[3]In March 2005, Boyle said in an interview that he would not direct the sequel due to commitments to Sunshine (2007), but he would serve as executive producer. He also revealed that the film would revolve around the aftermath of the first movie.[4] It was also revealed that the film would include the US Army \"declaring the war against infection had been won, and that the reconstruction of the country could begin.\"[5] Boyle hired Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to helm the project after seeing Fresnadillo's 2001 film Intacto.[6] Fresnadillo stated that he was \"thrilled working on his first English language film alongside such an exciting international cast and talented production team.\"[7]Both Fresnadillo and Lopez-Lavigne were involved in writing the script, which revolved around a family and what happened to them in the aftermath of the original film, which the producers \"liked a lot\".[8]Boyle said in March 2005 that the sequel would feature a new cast, since previous cast members Cillian Murphy, Megan Burns, and Naomie Harris were occupied with their own projects.[4] On 23 August 2006, Jeremy Renner was announced to portray Doyle, one of the principal characters for 28 Weeks Later.[9] On 31 August 2006, Harold Perrineau was announced to portray a US Special Forces pilot in the film.[10]On 1 September 2006, principal photography for 28 Weeks Later began in London[11] with much of the filming taking place at Canary Wharf.","produced_by":"Enrique López-Lavigne|Andrew Macdonald|Allon Reich|Bernard Bellew|","starring":"Robert Carlyle|Rose Byrne|Jeremy Renner|Harold Perrineau|Catherine McCormack|Mackintosh Muggleton|Imogen Poots|Idris Elba|","running_time":"100 minutes","Sequel":"Fox Atomic stated in June 2007 that they would consider producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well.[26] In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle said he had a possible story for the next film. \"There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've got to think about it, whether it's right or not.\"[27] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: \"I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between a group of people who are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware.\"[28] In January 2011, Danny Boyle said, \"There is a good idea for it, and once I've got [my stage production of] Frankenstein open, I'll begin to think about it a bit more.\"[29] On 13 April 2013, Boyle stated: \"[I]t’s 40/60 whether [a sequel] happens or not. But we did have an idea of where to set it and what it might be about.\" When asked to share that idea, Boyle laughed and said, \"No, because they’ll end up in The Walking Dead.\"[30] On 14 January 2015, Garland stated: \"We’ve just started talking about it seriously. We’ve got an idea. Danny [Boyle] and [producer] Andrew [Macdonald] and I have been having quite serious conversations about it so it is a possibility. It’s complicated. There’s a whole bunch of reasons why it’s complicated, which are boring so I won’t go into, but there’s a possibility,\" also adding: \"It’s more likely to be 28 Months than 28 Years. 28 months gives you one more place to go,\" hinting at the possibility of a fourth film as well.[31]","music_by":"John Murphy","edited_by":"Chris Gill","written_by":"Rowan Joffé|Juan Carlos Fresnadillo|E.
