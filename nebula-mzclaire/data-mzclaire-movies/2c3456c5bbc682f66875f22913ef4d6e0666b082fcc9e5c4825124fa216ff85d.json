Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film five out of five, describing it as \"a tragic masterpiece\", and saying, \"This documentary about the late British soul singer is an overwhelmingly sad, intimate—and dismaying—study of a woman whose talent and charisma helped turn her into a target\".[29] Geoffrey Macnab from The Independent also rated the documentary five out of five, reviewed it as \"brilliant\" and \"unutterably sad\", and stated: \"There were many, many contributory factors to Amy Winehouse going off the rails, which are explored in the effect of Amy\".[30] According to The Guardian, Amy has been placed at no. 3 out of \"The 50 Best Films of 2015 in Australia\" at the end of the year[31] and has been placed at no. 6 out of \"The 50 Best 2015 Films in the UK\".[32]Amy has broken the UK box office record for the highest opening weekend of a British documentary film, grossing at £519,000 from 133 cinemas three days after its release on 3 July. It also enjoyed success in the US, earning £142,000 from just six cinemas before it expanded in the following weeks. The film scored a $37,002 site average in the US in three days. The documentary has recorded the biggest ever opening weekend for a British documentary in the UK, and the second biggest discounting concert films of all time. The film opened with $222,015 across six sites, with a location average of $37,002 – $10,000 more than Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) managed on its first weekend and even beating March of the Penguins (2005) 's $44,373 and the film has increased its box office peak after its initial release nationally on 10 July.[33]Amy has become the highest grossing British documentary film of all time, as it opened with a box office of £3 million on its first weekend.[7]The film has been heavily criticised by Winehouse's father, Mitch Winehouse. He has distanced himself from the documentary, stating the film is \"misleading\" and \"contains some basic untruths\", according to his spokesman.[34] On 7 May, Winehouse's father Mitch appeared on This Morning and described the film as \"preposterous\". He further stated:\"The film is representing me in a not very good way. There is no balance, there's nothing about the foundation. It's portraying me and Amy in not a very good light.\"[35]However, he also said that the film contains \"superb\" and \"beautiful\" footage of Winehouse. He then added: \"Half of me wants to say don't go see it. But then the other part of me is saying maybe go see the videos, put your headphones in and listen to Amy's music while they're watching the videos. It's the narrative that's the problem.\"[36]Universal Music instigated the documentary but they only secured the cooperation of the singer's parents, Mitch and Janis Winehouse, when they signed up Kapadia as the director for the film. Winehouse's father, who was a fan of the director's previous documentary film Senna (2010), wanted the same treatment to be given to his late daughter's documentary. However, upon watching the completed film about Winehouse, Mitch was unhappy with how the film portrayed him. Feeling he had been portrayed as the villain, Mitch threatened legal action until limited changes were made to the film. However, he has still publicly condemned the final cut of the film, claiming that Kapadia had an agenda to make him the anti-hero from the start.[12]Mitch requested that he wants the film to be further edited, but the film crew have declined his wish, adding: \"When we were approached to make the film, we came on board with the full backing of the Winehouse family, and we approached the project with total objectivity.\" They said the film reflects findings from around \"100 interviews with people that knew Amy\". On 3 July 2015 (the day Amy was initially released), the singer's father, Mitch appeared on Loose Women to defend his place against the film and announced that himself and Winehouse's former boyfriend, Reg Traviss are making an alternative film, entitled A Letter To Amy, so it's a \"more accurate\" project, to \"correct all the wrongs and omissions\" that were in Kapadia's film.[37] On 24 February 2016, Winehouse's father, Mitch reappeared on This Morning once again and stated that he would prefer Adele to win the award that his late daughter was posthumously nominated for at the 2016 BRIT Awards.[38] This was because the nomination for \"British Female Solo Artist\" was as a result of the film and the film's soundtrack, which he seemed to be unhappy about.","amy":"British theatrical release poster","box_office":"$22 million[3]","cinematography":"Matt Curtis","production_company":"Film 4 Krishwerkz Entertainment On The Corner Films Playmaker Films Universal Music","directed_by":"Asif Kapadia","Content":"The film narrative is focused on the life of singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, who was found dead on 23 July 2011 from alcohol poisoning, at the age of 27 at her home in Camden, North London.[11]The film starts with a 1998 home movie depicting a fourteen-year-old Winehouse singing along with her long-time friend, Juliette Ashby, at the birthday party of their mutual friend, Lauren Gilbert, at a home in Southgate, London.
