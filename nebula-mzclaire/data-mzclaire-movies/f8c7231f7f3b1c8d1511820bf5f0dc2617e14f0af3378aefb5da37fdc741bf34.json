Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 83%, based on 110 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Smart, funny, and powered by fine performances from Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson, Drinking Buddies offers a bittersweet slice of observational comedy.\"[14] At Metacritic gives the films a score of 71 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"general favorable reviews\".[15]A. O. Scott of The New York Times remarked \"Mr. Swanberg’s camera weaves through bodies at rest, at work and at the bar in no particular hurry, and his script captures the idioms of men and women who are equally inclined to waste words and to say very little. But the busy tedium of their lives is given shape and direction by the skill of the cast and by the precision of the director’s eye, ear and editing instincts.\"[16]Upon the film's UK release, Peter Bradshaw gave the film three stars out of five, calling it \"a lo-fi relationship drama that is interesting, if unevenly presented...an intriguing and distinctive story, soberly told\"; according to Bradshaw, \"Swanberg interestingly shows how booze loosens them up, lowers their inhibitions, and yet blurs their emotional reactions, in the process weirdly muting and endlessly deferring the sexual drama.\"[17] Quentin Tarantino named it one of the top 10 movies of the year so far in October 2013.[18]","drinking_buddies":"Theatrical release poster","box_office":"$343,341[3]","cinematography":"Ben Richardson","production_company":"Burn Later Productions","directed_by":"Joe Swanberg","release_dates":"March 13, 2013 (2013-03-13) (South by Southwest)|August 23, 2013 (2013-08-23) (United States)||||","Production":"The idea to set the film in a brewery came when director Joe Swanberg received a brewing set-up as a birthday present.[5] According to Swanberg,\"I wanted to do something about Craft Beer [independent breweries] and set in the Craft Beer world but also I was inspired by Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, a Paul Mazursky movie. Just to tell a complicated adult [story] that was funny, that managed to remain funny even though it was getting into serious, interesting things.\"[6]The dialog was improvised.[7] Instead of a script, the actors received outlines which covered the major plot points and were told each day what had to happen in that day's scenes.[8] Relying heavily on improvisation is a key feature of the Mumblecore film movement. He said, \"knowing that the structure was already pretty heavily in place, it was about letting the actors own their characters, and have a big say in the clothes that they wore, and in the interactions that they have with each other.\" He added: \"The improv was used to mainly make the middle of the movie more complicated, and less predictable that a typical romantic comedy would be.\" Swanberg also stated \"They need to be listening to each other and reacting honestly and I need to be paying really close attention because there’s not a script to fall back on. The goal of doing it that way is to keep everybody engaged and create situations that feel fun and natural\".[9]Filming took place in Chicago, Illinois in July 2012.[10] The film was shot in an actual brewery, called Revolution, where one of the female brewers named Kate was the basis for Wilde's character.[11] The actors actually drank real beer during the filming and even did real work for the brewing company.[9] Wilde would later comment that the cast was \"hammered the entire movie\" [12] [13]The film concludes with an open ending with Swanberg stating \"it's hard for me, knowing how uncertain the world is, to put a certain, definite ending on a movie. I feel like I'm hopefully hinting that there's a resolution without it being cemented down, or hammering you over the head with it.\"[11]Drinking Buddies has music supervised by Chris Swanson, Grant Manship and Kathleen Cook of Jagjaguwar.
