She works as a waitress in a restaurant and falls in love with Eddie, a Māori chef, despite her father's objections. For a price, she agrees to marry a Chinese co-worker so that he (and his Chinese wife) can establish permanent residency. The money gives her the independence she needs to leave her parents' house and move in with Eddie. Complications arise when Eddie realises the depth of her father's fury and the strength of Nina's family ties.","language":"English Croatian Māori Japanese","Reception":"Broken English received generally positive reviews, currently holding an 82% 'fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[3]","box_office":"$541,377[1]","cinematography":"John Toon","production_company":"Village Roadshow Pictures Worldwide New Zealand Film Commission","directed_by":"Gregor Nicholas","broken_english":"Theatrical release poster","release_dates":"19 September 1996 (1996-09-19) (NZ)|2 May 1997 (1997-05-02) (US)||||","Production":"Aleksandra Vujčić had never acted before and was discovered in an Auckland bar.[2]","produced_by":"Robin Scholes Timothy White Janet McIver","starring":"Aleksandra Vujčić Julian Arahanga Rade Šerbedžija Marton Csokas","running_time":"92 minutes","music_by":"Murray Grindlay Murray McNabb","External links":"","edited_by":"David Coulson","written_by":"Gregor Nicholas Johanna Pigott"}
