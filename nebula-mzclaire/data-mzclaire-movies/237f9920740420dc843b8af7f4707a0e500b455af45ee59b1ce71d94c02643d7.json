{"country":"United States","distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","Plot overview":"Set in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, New York in September 1937 amidst The Great Depression , this coming-of-age comedy focuses on Eugene Morris Jerome, a Polish-Jewish American teenager who experiences puberty, sexual awakening, and a search for identity as he tries to deal with his family, including his older brother Stanley, his parents Kate and Jack, Kate's sister Blanche, and her two daughters, Nora and Laurie, who come to live there after their father's death.","language":"English","Reception":"Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"The movie feels so plotted, so constructed, so written, that I found myself thinking maybe they shouldn't have filmed the final draft of the screenplay. Maybe there was an earlier draft that was a little disorganized and unpolished, but still had the jumble of life in it.... The movie was directed by Gene Saks, who directs many of Simon's plays on both the stage and the screen, and whose gift is for the theater. His plays have the breath of life; his movies feel like the official authorized version. Everything is by the numbers.\"[2][3]","box_office":"$11,957,943[1]","cinematography":"John Bailey","production_company":"Rastar","directed_by":"Gene Saks","release_dates":"December 25, 1986 (1986-12-25)|||||","produced_by":"Ray Stark","starring":"Blythe Danner|Bob Dishy|Judith Ivey|Jonathan Silverman|","running_time":"109 minutes","music_by":"Michael Small","edited_by":"Carol Littleton","written_by":"Neil Simon","budget":"$18 million"}
