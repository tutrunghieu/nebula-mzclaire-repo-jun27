{"based_on":"Diamond Head 1960 novel  by Peter Gilman","country":"United States","diamond_head":"1963 theatrical poster","distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","Plot summary":"Richard \"King\" Howland is a swaggering bigoted land baron living on the Big Island of Hawaii. He objects when his sister, Sloan Howland, announces she plans to marry Paul Kahana, a native Hawaiian, even though Richard is having a torrid affair with an Asian woman, Mai Chen. During Sloan and Paul's engagement party, Mai Chen's brother attacks Richard with a knife. Paul tries to break up the fight and is killed. Bitter at her brother for Paul's death, Sloan runs off to Honolulu where she is taken in by Paul's brother, Dean, and his family.Meanwhile, Mai Chen gives birth to Richard's child, but dies during childbirth. Ever the rabid racist, Richard refuses to accept the child and Sloan takes it upon herself to care for the baby. After an angry fight with Sloan and Dean, Richard is confronted with a personal dilemma — whether to continue on with his close-minded ways or to welcome his newborn son into his family.Although the story is based on the novel by Peter Gilman, the screenplay by Marguerite Roberts makes several significant changes in Gilman's story. Several characters are eliminated, including Richard's father, Richard's wife, and his hapa haole (half-Hawaiian/half Caucasian) half-brother. Roberts also changed the ending of the story.","language":"English","box_office":"$4.5 million (US/ Canada rentals) [1]","cinematography":"Sam Leavitt","directed_by":"Guy Green","release_dates":"January 30, 1963 (1963-01-30)|||||","produced_by":"Jerry Bresler","starring":"Charlton Heston Yvette Mimieux George Chakiris France Nuyen James Darren Aline MacMahon Elizabeth Allen","running_time":"107 minutes","music_by":"John Williams","edited_by":"William A.
