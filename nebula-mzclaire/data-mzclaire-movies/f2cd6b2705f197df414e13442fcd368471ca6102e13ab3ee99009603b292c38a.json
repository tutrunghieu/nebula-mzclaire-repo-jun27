P. Balasubrahmanyam; the music directors were initially against including him, feeling that the \"Madrasi\" would not do justice to a Hindi composition, but Balachander cited that if the lead character played by Haasan could not speak Hindi well, then even if Balasubrahmanyam blemished the song, it would \"capture the character.\"[3]Two portions of \"Tere Mere Beech Mein\" were later sampled in the hit 2004 Britney Spears song \"Toxic\" as part of its hook.[4]","release_dates":"5 June 1981","produced_by":"L.
