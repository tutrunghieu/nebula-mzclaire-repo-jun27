The Hollywood Reporter described the outcome as \"a major upset\". Der Spiegel said it was a \"very conservative selection\".[3] Der Tagesspiegel criticised the outcome, saying that the \"jury shunned almost all the contemporary films that were admired or hotly debated at an otherwise pretty remarkable festival\".[5] The film was also selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.[6]Critics praised the use of actual prisoners in the film, saying it brought a higher intensity to the piece.[3] Filmed largely in black-and-white, it has been described as a \"deeply humanist film\" that \"blends gentle humour with an emotional punch\".[5] Paolo Taviani said that he hoped moviegoers would \"say to themselves or even those around them... that even a prisoner with a dreadful sentence, even a life sentence, is and remains a human being\". Vittorio Taviani read out the names of the cast.[3]At Metacritic, the film was given a rating of 76/100 based on 12 critics, which evaluates as generally favorable reviews[clarification needed][7]","language":"Italian","cinematography":"Simone Zampagni","production_company":"Rai Cinema La Talee Stemal Entertainment","directed_by":"Paolo Taviani Vittorio Taviani","release_dates":"11 February 2012 (2012-02-11) (Berlin)|2 March 2012 (2012-03-02) (Italy)||||","produced_by":"Grazia Volpi","starring":"Salvatore Striano Cosimo Rega Giovanni Arcuri Antonio Frasca","running_time":"77 minutes[1]","music_by":"Giuliano Taviani Carmelo Travia","edited_by":"Roberto Perpignani"}
