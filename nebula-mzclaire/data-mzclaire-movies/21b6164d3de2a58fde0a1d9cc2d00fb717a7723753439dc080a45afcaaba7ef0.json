{"country":"United Kingdom","distributed_by":"Columbia","Plot":"Moore and Caine play dual rolesâ€”a pair of small time con-men and a pair of inept nuclear physicists who believe they have invented a limitless supply of energy. The con men use their resemblance to the scientists to con their way into the scientists' safe deposit boxes and steal the formula, but in so doing, they become entangled in a shady world of spies and international intrigue. The film includes a number of cameo appearances, including Jenny Seagrove (Winner's partner at the time) playing two different roles, John Cleese, Patsy Kensit, Alexandra Pigg and Nicholas Courtney. The film also features Roger Moore's daughter, Deborah Moore, in a supporting role.","language":"English","Reception":"The Radio Times Guide to Films' review of Bullseye! states: \"this appallingly unfunny comedy is a career low for all concerned\".[2]","cinematography":"Alan Jones","production_company":"21st Century Film Corporation","directed_by":"Michael Winner","release_dates":"United Kingdom: 2 Nov 1990","produced_by":"Menahem Golan Michael Winner","starring":"Michael Caine Roger Moore Sally Kirkland","running_time":"95 minutes","music_by":"John Du Prez","External links":"","edited_by":"Terry Rawlings","written_by":"Leslie Bricusse Laurence Marks Maurice Gran Nick Mead Michael Winner","budget":"US$15 million[1]"}
