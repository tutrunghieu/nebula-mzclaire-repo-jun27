{"based_on":"BloodRayne  by Majesco and Terminal Reality","Cast":"","country":"United States Germany","distributed_by":"Boll KG Productions","Plot":"The film centers on the character of Rayne, an unholy breed of human and vampire called a Dhampir. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood. She is the daughter of the Vampire King Kagan who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan raped her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her.Sebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, who fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a Dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with Kagan. Rayne sets out to the monastery to find it.Rayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it.When she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called Belial, who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water; the rib overcomes the cross; and the heart overcomes sunlight. The parts have been hidden across the lands. As Kagan wants all these parts, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him.Rayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne fights and kills her for it. With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart.Sebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne. The film ends when Rayne leaves the castle and goes to the mountains.","language":"English","bloodrayne":"Theatrical release poster","Critical reception":"BloodRayne has received negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a rating of only 4%, meaning that out of 50 reviews only 2 were positive. The consensus reads: \"BloodRayne is an absurd sword-and-sorcery vid-game adaptation from schlock-maestro Uwe Boll, featuring a distinguished (and slumming) cast.\"[7] It was ranked 48th in Rotten Tomatoes's 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s.[8] Metacritic gave the film a score of 18% based on 13 reviews, summarizing the reviews as \"overwhelming dislike\".[9]Actor Michael Madsen called BloodRayne \"an abomination... a horrifying and preposterous movie\", but added that he enjoyed working with Boll and would certainly work with him again if asked.[10] Laura Bailey, who was the voice of Rayne in the BloodRayne games, was asked at her panel at Anime Boston 2007 what her thoughts were on the film adaptation, and said \"Oh God, that movie sucked. And that movie was so bad. I saw it on The Movie Channel and I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of it! It was so bad and it was kinda sad that they took that because I really liked the games.\"[11]Critics ridiculed Boll for hiring actual prostitutes instead of actors for a scene featuring Meat Loaf in order to save on production costs.[12][13] Writer Guinevere Turner stated in the 2009 documentary Tales from the Script that when she turned in her first draft of the film's script two weeks late, rather than asking for redrafts Boll accepted it and then made many of his own changes; and he then asked the actors to \"take a crack at it\".[14]Some critics were more forgiving of the film. Berge Garabedian of JoBlo's movie reviews described as the film as \"actually pretty decent…for what it is\" namely a video game adaptation, with a \"hot lead actress\" in the form of Kristanna Loken, and number of surprisingly fun and bloody action sequences. He acknowledges the dialog is poor and the story lame but says the film is \"not as bad as you’d suspect\" and an adequate bloody low-budget vampire film.[15] Steve Chupnick of the Latino Review gave the film a B rating, saying that although it was not a good film it was far from the worst he's seen and mentioned the Kristanna Loken nude scene as something in the films favor.[16]The film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards including, Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Kristanna Loken), Worst Supporting Actor (Ben Kingsley), Worst Supporting Actress (Michelle Rodriguez), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. Bloodrayne did not win any, having been dominated by Basic Instinct 2 and Little Man with seven nominations each.[17]In 2009, Time listed the film #6 on their list of top ten worst video games movies.[18]The film was number one on GameTrailers countdown of the worst video game movies ever. The reviewers from GameTrailers said that \"every actor is miscast, every wig is too fake, every sex scene is too inappropriate, and every action scene is too improvised.\"[19]","box_office":"$3,650,275[1]","cinematography":"Mathias Neumann","production_company":"Boll KG Productions Herold Productions Pitchblack Pictures Brightlight Pictures Romar Entertainment Event Films","directed_by":"Uwe Boll","Home media":"Before the DVD of this film was released, Boll removed the Romar name and logo from the credits and packaging of this film.
