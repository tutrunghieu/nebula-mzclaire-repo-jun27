They are inveterate gamblers who have joined forces to trick local bookies, by taking advantage of delayed broadcasts of horse races. After arriving in small town Tainuia Junction, Wes and Cyril get involved in a bootlegging ring, arson and murder. Among a group of local eccentrics, they also meet the Tainuia Kid (Billy T. James), a Maori who believes himself to be a Mexican bandito. He becomes a kind of protector for the duo.Morrieson’s novels featured some sexuality and violence, but the film downplayed these aspects of the source novel and concentrated more on the comical elements. Some argued that the film followed the spirit of the Ealing comedies. One writer argued that the book makes \"good-natured, nostalgic fun of small town 1940s New Zealand where Friday night’s excitement is a pie and chips at the boozer\" with \"larger than life parodic characters\".[2]","came_a_hot_friday":"Promotional film poster","language":"English","box_office":"NZ $950,000[1]","cinematography":"Alun Bollinger","directed_by":"Ian Mune","release_dates":"1985 (1985) (New Zealand)|4 October 1985 (1985-10-04) (U.S.)||||","starring":"Peter Bland Phillip Gordon Michael Lawrence Billy T.
