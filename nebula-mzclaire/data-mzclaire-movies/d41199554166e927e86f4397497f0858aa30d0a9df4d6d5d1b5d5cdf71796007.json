{"distributed_by":"20th Century Fox IFC Films Icon Entertainment Warner Bros.","Cast and production":"The drawings made by the character Ulises were really made by Luis Fernando Peña, the protagonist of the film, except for the graffiti, which was made by professionals. When filming, the actors could not sleep at their own houses because they had to work for 24 hours.The name of the movie is a wordplay in Spanish: \"Amarte\" and \"Amar te\". The first one is the accusative second person singular, while the second one is the infinitive verb and the second person reflexive pronoun. The first option would be literally translated as \"To love you hurts\" (It hurts to love you) and the second option as \"To love hurts you\" (It hurts you to love). It implies the pain Renata and Ulises feel by loving each other (amarte duele) and the pain that loving someone else provokes (amar te duele), like in the scene where Ulises' mother is taking care of him after the beating at Renata's school, and she suffers with him.","Plot":"The story begins in a suburb of Mexico City with Ulises, whose father sells clothes in the market.
