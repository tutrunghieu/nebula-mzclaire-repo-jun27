The mission entails entering Vietnam to destroy an old American bunker filled with missiles before the Viet Cong can get to them.Due to the dangerous nature of the mission, a group of Chinese American soldier convicts are selected to accompany him, led by Tung Ming-sun. Survivors are promised a pardon, U.S. citizenship and $200,000 each. After a brief training session they are dropped into Vietnam. During the jump, Lam learns too late that the mission has been aborted.Once in enemy territory, they are met by some Cambodian guerrillas led by Godenzi and take refuge in a small town. There they meet Weasel (aka Chieh Man-yeh), and his mentally ill \"Uncle\", Yeung.Later, the squad is captured and incarcerated in a POW camp, where the prisoners are forced to play Russian roulette in a similar manner to the film The Deer Hunter. After escaping, they discover that one of the Cambodian guerrillas is a traitor. With the Vietnamese military in pursuit, they are able to reach the bunker, where a final showdown with the (giggling) Vietnamese general occurs.","language":"Cantonese English","cinematography":"Au Gaam Hung Arthur Wong","production_company":"Bo Ho Films Paragon Films","directed_by":"Sammo Hung","Home media":"On 2 April 2001, DVD was released by Hong Kong Legends in the United Kingdom in Region 2.","release_dates":"9 July 1987 (1987-07-09)|||||","eastern_condors":"Original film poster","produced_by":"Corey Yuen Wu Ma Jeffrey Lau Leonard Ho","starring":"Sammo Hung Yuen Biao Joyce Godenzi Yuen Wah Lam Ching-ying Yuen Woo-ping Corey Yuen Billy Chow","running_time":"100 minutes","music_by":"Sherman Chow","edited_by":"Peter Cheung","written_by":"Barry Wong"}
