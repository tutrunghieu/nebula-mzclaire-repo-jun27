There is no trace of the sunken ship, but there is a sunken city, the city of Port Royal that was destroyed in an earthquake in 1692. The $1,000,000 in gold bullion was in fact lost in a modern-day quake and is part of an insurance fraud by Trevor. He doesnâ€™t want the divers to find the gold and will stop at nothing to ensure the success of his plan.","release_dates":"March 11, 1953","produced_by":"Albert J.
