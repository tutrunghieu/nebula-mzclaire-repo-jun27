{"country":"Japan","distributed_by":"Imamura Productions, Shochiku Films Ltd., Beverly Pictures (USA)","Plot":"The film depicts carnivalesque atmosphere summed up by the cry \"Ee ja nai ka\" (\"Why not?\") in Japan in 1867 and 1868 in the days leading to the Meiji Restoration. It examines the effects of the political and social upheaval of the time, and culminates in a revelrous march on the Tokyo Imperial Palace, which turns into a massacre. Characteristically, Imamura focuses not on the leaders of the country, but on characters in the lower classes and on the fringes of society.","language":"Japanese","cinematography":"Shinsaku Himeda (as Masahisa Himeda)","directed_by":"Shohei Imamura","release_dates":"March 14, 1981 (Japan); January 8, 1981 (USA)","eijanaika_/_why_not?":"DVD cover for Eijanaika (1981)","produced_by":"Shohei Imamura Shoichi Ozawa Shigemi Sugisaki Jiro Tomoda","starring":"Kaori Momoi Shigeru Izumiya Ken Ogata Shigeru Tsuyuguchi Masao Kusakari Yūko Tanaka Mitsuko Baisho","running_time":"151 minutes","music_by":"Shinichirô Ikebe","edited_by":"Keiichi Uraoka","written_by":"Hisashi Yamauchi"}
