It tells the story of a chocolate factory preparing to launch a new luxury range, Passionelles. However, during the production run a worker falls into a vat of chocolate and dies, meaning human flesh is present in the first batch released. The horrified owners try and fail to recall the chocolates, but when they go on sale, they prove a surprise hit. Keen to continue the success, the developers try to replicate the taste with animal meat, but this fails miserably - leading them to realise human flesh is the key ingredient, and going to extreme lengths to obtain dead bodies to use in the chocolate.The Time Out Film Guide describes the 'recipe' for this film and concludes that of the result: \"the consistency should be lumpy and the taste insipid.\"[2]","music_by":"Richard Hartley","External links":"","edited_by":"John Grover","written_by":"Paul D.
