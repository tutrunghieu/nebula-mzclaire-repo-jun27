However, Kitano did return to darker themes in his next film, Sonatine, as well as many later works. In the film, Kitano develops his more delicate, romantic side along with his trademark deadpan approach. In 2002 the Japanese filmmaker directed a similar movie, Dolls, a romantic tale about three pairs of lovers.This film marks the first collaboration between Kitano and composer Joe Hisaishi, who had previously created the acclaimed soundtracks of many of Hayao Miyazaki's anime films, including Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Hisaishi would go on to compose the OSTs for all of Kitano's films until Dolls, after which their collaboration ended.Occasional Office Kitano actor, Claude Maki, who plays the mute main character, went on to appear in Kitano's film Brother as Ken, a Japanese-American punk set to become leader of a Yakuza clan. In Brother, Claude speaks mostly in American-English with some occasional Japanese.","produced_by":"Masayuki Mori","starring":"Claude Maki Hiroko Ohshima Sabu Kawahara Susumu Terajima Katsuya Koiso Testsu Watanabe","running_time":"101 minutes","music_by":"Joe Hisaishi","edited_by":"Takeshi Kitano","written_by":"Takeshi Kitano"}
