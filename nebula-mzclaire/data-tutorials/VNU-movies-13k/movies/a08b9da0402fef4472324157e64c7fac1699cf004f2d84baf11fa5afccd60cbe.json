José is in love with the flirtatious Lucía and dies defending her honor. Carmelo is mistakenly arrested for the killing, and spends several years in prison. After being released, he declares his love for Candela.Although Candela is now \"free\" to marry Carmelo she is haunted (and obsessed) by the ghost of José, who reappears every night to dance with her. Candela, while speaking with Lucía, learns that José pursued her even after he married Candela. She renounces him, but is unable to shake his hold on her. Tía Rosario provides the solution - Lucia must dance with José, an act which will exorcise his ghost forever. (It is never made clear if Lucía actually gives up her life to join him, but she never reappears in the film after their dance scene.)","el_amor_brujo":"Spanish film poster","language":"Spanish","cinematography":"Teodoro Escamilla","directed_by":"Carlos Saura","Soundtrack":"The film fleshed out the story with spoken dialogue and several songs, but used the entire score of the ballet.
