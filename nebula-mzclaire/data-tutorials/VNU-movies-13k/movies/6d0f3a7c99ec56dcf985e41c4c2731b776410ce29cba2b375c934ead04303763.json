{"directed_by":"Ingmar Bergman","Cast":"(Tartan DVD release of this film erroneously lists \"Liv Ullmann\" as one of the three main stars. Ullmann is not in this film)","country":"Sweden","Plot summary":"Rational, exacting, and self-controlled theater director, Henrik Vogler, often stays after rehearsal to think and plan. On this day, Anna comes back, ostensibly looking for a bracelet. She is the lead in his new production of Strindberg's A Dream Play. She talks of her hatred for her mother (now dead), an alcoholic actress who was Vogler's star and lover. Vogler falls into a reverie, remembering a day Anna's mother, Rakel, late in life, came after rehearsal to beg him to come to her apartment. He awakes and Anna reveals the reason she has returned: she jolts him into an emotional response, rare for him, and the feelings of a young woman and an older man play out.","release_dates":"9 April 1984","produced_by":"JÃ¶rn Donner","starring":"Erland Josephson Ingrid Thulin Lena Olin Nadja Palmstjerna-Weiss Bertil Guve","running_time":"70 min","language":"Swedish","External links":"","written_by":"Ingmar Bergman","cinematography":"Sven Nykvist"}
