Gleiberman criticised the plot as \"so dense with ersatz Elmore Leonard convolutions that it manages to stay three steps ahead of the audience and four steps behind common sense\".[21] Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times also criticised the story, saying that the film was \"so over-plotted that it's borderline incomprehensible\".[22] A more positive review came from Jeff Otto at IGN who praised the film for originality and also praised the acting. Otto stated that \"the final result is a bit of a mess, but it's one hell of an entertaining mess\".[23] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also wrote a positive review, giving the film three stars and saying he admired it.[24] The film was among Tony Scott's favourites of his own films,[25] although he was also very critical of it, saying, \"I didn't let the movie breathe enough. The script was great – Richard Kelly wrote a great script – and I got overcome by the insanity of the world I was touching. I think I fucked up on that one.\"[26]","box_office":"$22,944,502","cinematography":"Dan Mindel","production_company":"Scott Free Productions Davis Films Metropolitan Filmexport","directed_by":"Tony Scott","Home media":"The film was released on DVD on February 21, 2006.

The article, written by Sacha Gervasi and titled My gun for hire: Why a movie star's rebel daughter turned into a bounty hunter, was about an English woman named Domino Harvey who was working as a bounty hunter, apprehending fugitives who had skipped bail for the Celes King Bail Bond agency in South Central Los Angeles. While Harvey was one of the few female bounty hunters,[3] what caught the attention of Shulman and Scott was that she was the daughter of the late actor Laurence Harvey.Tony Scott tracked Domino to Beverly Hills, where she was living at the time with her mother Paulene Stone and Stone's then husband Peter Morton. He invited Domino to his office, where he proposed a film of her life. Domino agreed and sold Scott the film rights. According to the Los Angeles Times, Harvey was paid $360,000 for the rights.[4] Tony Scott interviewed Harvey about her life and her work bounty hunting. Scott also met and interviewed Ed Martinez and Choco, who were Domino's bounty hunting colleagues. She took him to meet Celes King III, the bail bondsman they worked for.20th Century Fox, which had a first refusal deal on the project, turned it down[5] and in the end the film was financed by New Line Cinema.Steve Barancik wrote the first draft of the screenplay,[6][7] in 1997[8] which Scott rejected. A second script was written by Roger Avary,[9] but was also rejected by Scott. Scott described the two rejected screenplays as conventional biopics of Domino Harvey's life, which was not what he had in mind. Finally, Richard Kelly was asked to write the screenplay after Scott read his script for Southland Tales.[10] Kelly was sent transcripts of Domino Harvey's interviews with Tony Scott, but he did not read the scripts that Scott had rejected.[11] In discussing the finished product, Kelly commented that \"...Domino might be one of the most subversive films released by a major studio since Fight Club\".[12]","Filming":"Filming began in Los Angeles, California, on October 4, 2004.
