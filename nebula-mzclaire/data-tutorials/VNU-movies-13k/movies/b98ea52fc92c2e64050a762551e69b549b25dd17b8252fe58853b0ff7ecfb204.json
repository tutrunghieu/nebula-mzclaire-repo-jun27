Of all movies with a 0% rating, Ballistic had the most reviews of all as of March 2014.[2] The critical consensus states: \"A startlingly inept film, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever offers overblown, wall-to-wall action without a hint of wit, coherence, style, or originality\".[3] In March 2007, Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film #1 on its \"The Worst of the Worst\" movie list:[4][5][6] \"the worst-reviewed movie in our site’s history\".[7] The film also has a score of 19 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 26 critics indicating \"overwhelming dislike\".[8]Roger Ebert gave the film half a star out of four and later listed it on his most hated movies list and said of the film: \"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is an ungainly mess, submerged in mayhem, occasionally surfacing for cliches, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence. There is nothing wrong with the title Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever that renaming it 'Ballistic' would not have solved. Strange that they would choose such an ungainly title when, in fact, the movie is not about Ecks versus Sever but about Ecks and Sever working together against a common enemy — although Ecks, Sever and the audience take a long time to figure that out.\"[9]In 2,705 theaters the film grossed $7,010,474, with an average of $2,591 per theater and ranking #4 at the box office.
