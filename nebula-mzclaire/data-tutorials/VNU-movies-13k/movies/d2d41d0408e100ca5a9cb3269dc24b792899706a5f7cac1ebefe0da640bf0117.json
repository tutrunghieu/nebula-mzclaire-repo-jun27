Blank said that he felt “unconnected to the people around me”.[1] Keeping up with the antics of Herzog and Klaus Kinski (the film’s star) proved difficult for the reserved, introverted Blank. By the last week of production, he was so burnt out that he feared coming out of production \"like some Viet Nam veterans, horribly calloused\". He wrote in his journal, \"I'm tired of it all and I couldn't care less if they move the stupid ship – or finish the fucking film\".[2]Blank would often ask Herzog to repeat statements while being filmed that he originally made off-camera. In a 2009 interview with Jesse Pearson for Vice magazine, Blank was asked to recall a scene in the documentary showing Herzog delivering a monologue about the violence and destruction of the jungle around him. Blank says that the scene originally took place in the middle of a canoe ride, away from cameras, but he liked the speech enough to coax it out of Herzog again. \"When the moment was right,\" Blank told Vice, \"I pulled him aside and said, 'Can I do a little interview?' And he said, 'Sure.' Goodwin led him around to something that sparked him off on that tangent again. That's how we got the speech.\"[3]","starring":"Claudia Cardinale Werner Herzog Mick Jagger Klaus Kinski Jason Robards Candace Laughlin","running_time":"95 min.","language":"Spanish/English/German/Portuguese","Reception and honors":"The film received the 1983 British Academy Film Award for Best Documentary and was named Best of Festival at the San Francisco Film Festival the same year.[4]The film poster was created by Montana artist Monte Dolack and Eduardo Sanguinetti."}
