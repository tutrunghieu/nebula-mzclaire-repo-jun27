{"based_on":"\"Las babas del diablo\"  by Julio Cortázar","Cast":"Several people known in 1966 are in the film; others became famous later. The most widely noted cameo was by The Yardbirds, who perform \"Stroll On\" in the last third. Antonioni first asked Eric Burdon to play that scene but he turned it down. As Keith Relf sings, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck play to either side, along with Chris Dreja. After his guitar amplifier fails, Beck bashes his guitar to bits, as The Who did at the time. Antonioni had wanted The Who in Blowup as he was fascinated by Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing routine.[11] Steve Howe of The in Crowd recalled, \"We went on the set and started preparing for that guitar-smashing scene in the club. They even went as far as making up a bunch of Gibson 175 replicas ... and then we got dropped for The Yardbirds, who were a bigger name. That's why you see Jeff Beck smashing my guitar rather than his!\"[12] Antonioni also considered using The Velvet Underground (signed at the time to a division of MGM Records) in the nightclub scene, but, according to guitarist Sterling Morrison, \"the expense of bringing the whole entourage to England proved too much for him\".[13]Janet Street-Porter can be seen dancing in a silver coat and stripy Carnaby Street trousers during the scene inside the nightclub.[14]","country":"United Kingdom Italy|","distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Premier Productions|","story_by":"Michelangelo Antonioni","In popular culture":"FilmsMusicTelevision","language":"English","box_office":"$20,000,000[1]","cinematography":"Carlo Di Palma","production_company":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Bridge Films","directed_by":"Michelangelo Antonioni","Filming locations":"The opening mimes were filmed on the Plaza of The Economist Building in St. James's Street, London,[15] a project by 'New Brutalists' Alison and Peter Smithson constructed between 1959–64. The scene in which men leave The Spike was shot on Consort Road, Peckham.[16] The park scenes were at Maryon Park, Charlton, south-east London, and the park is little changed since the film.[17] The street with maroon shopfronts is Stockwell Road[16] and the shops belonged to motorcycle dealer Pride & Clarke. The scene in which the photographer sees the mysterious woman from his car and follows her was in Regent Street, London. He stops at Heddon Street[18] where the album cover of David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust was later photographed.[19] Outside shots of the photographer's studio were at 77 Pottery Lane, W11, and 39 Princes Place, W11. Photographer Jon Cowan leased his studio at 39 Princes Place to Antonioni for much of the interior and exterior filming, and Cowan's own photographic murals are featured in the film.[20][21] The exterior for the party scene towards the end of the film was shot outside 100 Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea. The interior, which is believed to be the same address, was shot in the apartment of London antiques dealer Christopher Gibbs.[22] The restaurant on the corner where Hemmings stops is on Blacklands Terrace, Chelsea SW3, there is still a restaurant there but no longer the one used in the film. The scene in the reproduced Ricky-Tick club with the Yardbirds performing \"Stroll On\" – a modified version of \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" – was filmed at Elstree Studios, from October 12 to 14, 1966.[23]","release_dates":"18 December 1966 (1966-12-18) (US)|29 August 1967 (1967-08-29) (UK)||||","running_time":"111 minutes","budget":"$1.8 million[1]","Awards and honours":"Academy AwardsBAFTA AwardsCannes Film FestivalGolden Globe Awards","screenplay_by":"Michelangelo Antonioni|Tonino Guerra|Edward Bond (English dialogue)|","Plot":"The plot is a day in the life of a glamorous fashion photographer, Thomas (Hemmings), inspired by the life of an actual \"Swinging London\" photographer, David Bailey.[9] After spending the night at a doss house where he has taken pictures for a book of art photos, Thomas is late for a photo shoot with Veruschka at his studio, which in turn makes him late for a shoot with other models later in the morning. He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage girls who are aspiring models (Birkin and Hills) ask to speak with him, but the photographer drives off to look at an antiques shop. Wandering into Maryon Park, he takes photos of two lovers. The woman (Redgrave) is furious at being photographed. The photographer then meets his agent for lunch, and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, Redgrave arrives asking for the film, but he deliberately hands her a different roll. She in turn writes down a false telephone number to give to him. His many enlargements of the black and white film are grainy but seem to show a dead body in the grass and a killer lurking in the trees with a gun. He is disturbed by a knock on the door, but it is the two girls again, with whom he has a romp in his studio and falls asleep. Awakening, he finds they hope he will photograph them but he tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\"As evening falls, the photographer goes back to the park and finds the body of a man, but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by a twig breaking, as if being stepped on. The photographer returns to his studio to find that all the negatives and prints are gone except for one very grainy blowup showing the body. After driving into town, he sees Redgrave and follows her into a club where The Yardbirds, featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck on guitar and Keith Relf on vocals, are seen performing the song \"Stroll On.\" A buzz in Beck's amplifier angers him so much he smashes his guitar on stage, then throws its neck into the crowd, the photographer makes a grab for it as a souvenir. The photographer grabs the neck and runs out of the club before anyone can snatch it from him. Then he has second thoughts about it, throws it on the pavement and walks away. A passer-by picks up the neck and throws it back down, not realizing it's from Jeff Beck's guitar.[10]At a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames near central London, the photographer finds both Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to Paris – when confronted, she says she is in Paris – and his agent (Peter Bowles), whom he wants to bring to the park as a witness. However, the photographer cannot put across what he has photographed. Waking up in the house at sunrise, he goes back to the park alone and finds that the body is gone.Befuddled, he watches a mimed tennis match, is drawn into it, picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players. While he watches the mime, the sound of the ball being played is heard. As the photographer watches this mimed match alone on the lawn, his image fades away, leaving only the grass as the film ends.","Reception":"The film was distributed in North America by MGM shell company Premier Pictures. Writing about Antonioni for Time in 2007, the film writer Richard Corliss states that the film grossed \"$20 million (about $120 million today) on a $1.8 million budget and helped liberate Hollywood from its puritanical prurience\".[1]According to Variety, the movie earned $5,900,000 in North American rentals in 1967.[24]Film critic Andrew Sarris said the movie was \"a mod masterpiece\". In Playboy magazine, film critic Arthur Knight wrote that Blowup would be \"as important and germinal a film as Citizen Kane, Open City and Hiroshima, Mon Amour – perhaps even more so\".[25]Time magazine called the film a \"far-out, uptight and vibrantly exciting picture\" that represented a \"screeching change of creative direction\" for Antonioni; the magazine predicted it would \"undoubtedly be by far the most popular movie Antonioni has ever made\".[26]Bosley Crowther, film critic of The New York Times, called it a \"fascinating picture, which has something real to say about the matter of personal involvement and emotional commitment in a jazzed-up, media-hooked-in world so cluttered with synthetic stimulations that natural feelings are overwhelmed\".[27] Crowther had reservations, describing the \"usual Antonioni passages of seemingly endless wanderings\" as \"redundant and long\"; nevertheless, he called Blowup a \"stunning picture – beautifully built up with glowing images and color compositions that get us into the feelings of our man and into the characteristics of the mod world in which he dwells\". Even film director Ingmar Bergman, who generally disliked Antonioni, acknowledged its significance: \"He's done two masterpieces, you don't have to bother with the rest. One is Blow-Up, which I've seen many times, and the other is La Notte, also a wonderful film, although that's mostly because of the young Jeanne Moreau.\"[28] Of the film's ending, Roger Ebert wrote in The Great Movies: \"What remains is a hypnotic conjuring act, in which a character is awakened briefly from a deep sleep of bored alienation and then drifts away again. This is the arc of the film. Not 'Swinging London.' Not existential mystery. Not the parallels between what Hemmings does with his photos and what Antonioni does with Hemmings. But simply the observations that we are happy when we are doing what we do well, and unhappy seeking pleasure elsewhere. I imagine Antonioni was happy when he was making this film.\"[29]Ebert also published a letter by actor Ronan O'Casey which claimed that the film's mysterious nature is the product of an \"unfinished\" production, and that scenes which would have \"depict[ed] the planning of the murder and its aftermath -- scenes with Vanessa, Sarah Miles and Jeremy Glover, Vanessa's new young lover who plots with her to murder me -- were never shot because the film went seriously over budget.\"[30]MGM did not gain approval for the film under the MPAA Production Code in the United States.[27] The film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency. The code's collapse and revision was foreshadowed when MGM released the film through a subsidiary distributor and Blowup was shown widely in North American cinemas.[8]","blowup":"theatrical release poster","References":"NotesBibliography","produced_by":"Carlo Ponti|Pierre Rouve|","starring":"David Hemmings|Vanessa Redgrave|Sarah Miles|","music_by":"Herbie Hancock (credited as Herbert Hancock)","External links":"","edited_by":"Frank Clarke"}
