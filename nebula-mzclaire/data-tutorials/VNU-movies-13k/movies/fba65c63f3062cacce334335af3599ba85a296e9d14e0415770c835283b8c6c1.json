He drives in pegs to mark his stance, hangs a weight and uses strings to determine the symmetry and center of his painting. His first attempt starts out peacefully but he soon encounters problems due to the weather and the size of his canvas. As García and a friend discuss Michelangelo's The Last Judgement, painted when Michelangelo was in his 60s, which García is fast approaching, the film's subject takes shape as the relationship between the artist's work and his own mortality. García's future attempts are much more rushed and frantic as he struggles to compete with the weather, the fleeting sun and the rotting and weighed down fruit in maintaining his vision.","cinematography":"Ángel Luis Fernández Javier Aguirresarobe","directed_by":"Víctor Erice","Awards":"At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival the film won the Jury Prize and the FIPRESCI Prize.[2]","release_dates":"October 1, 1992 (premiere at NYFF) 30 October 1992 (Spain)","produced_by":"Maria Moreno Carmen Martinez","starring":"Antonio López García Maria Moreno Enrique Gran","running_time":"138 minutes","music_by":"Pascal Gaigne","edited_by":"Juan Ignacio San Mateo","written_by":"Víctor Erice Antonio López García"}
