{"country":"Soviet Union","distributed_by":"Sovexportfilm","Plot":"The plot involves the arrival of Mr Johnny First in a sleepy \"Wild West\" town. After Mr First starts showing the residents Chaplinesque silent films on his cinematograph, the town's wild inhabitants are tamed by the images on the silver screen, trading saloons and brawls for glasses of milk and moving pictures.Beautiful dancer Diane falls for First, and so he ends up making a few enemies, including Diane's many other admirers and the barman who is threatened by the new competition for \"entertainment\".The film is a comedy critique of the wild west myth. Just as Buffalo Bill mythologized his exploits and later Hollywood elaborated the image, a Soviet film (i.e. the other side of the Cold War) deconstructs and satirizes it, both through the film and the film within film that Johnny First shows. It is a self-reflexive fable documenting its own evolution.","language":"Russian","cinematography":"Grigori Belenky","production_company":"Mosfilm","directed_by":"Alla Surikova","release_dates":"23 June 1987 (1987-06-23)|||||","starring":"Andrei Mironov Aleksandra Yakovleva","running_time":"99 min.","a_man_from_the_boulevard_des_capucines":"Original film poster","music_by":"Gennadi Gladkov","edited_by":"Inessa Brozhovskaya","written_by":"Eduard Akopov"}
