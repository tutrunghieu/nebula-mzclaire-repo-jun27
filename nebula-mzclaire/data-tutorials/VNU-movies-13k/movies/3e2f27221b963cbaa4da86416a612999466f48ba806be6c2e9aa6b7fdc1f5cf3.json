{"country":"United States","distributed_by":"Samuel Goldwyn Films","language":"English","Synopsis":"Jake Rademacher states at the beginning of the film that he is setting out to understand the experience, sacrifice, and motivation of his two brothers serving in Iraq. As the film develops, however, it becomes clear that Jake's underlying motivation is to prove himself to his brothers, as well as to himself. Jake, who longed to join the military as a youth but was denied entry into West Point (which is never fully explained in the movie), clearly feels the need for acceptance from his serving brothers.[citation needed] The film follows Jake’s experiences as he embeds with his brother Isaac in Iraq as well as other U.S. and Iraqi combat units. Rademacher goes along with reconnaissance troops on the Syrian border and into sniper \"hide sites\" in the Sunni Triangle. As Rademacher’s brothers return home, the film shows the toll separation and life-threatening work takes on soldiers’ parents, siblings, wives and children.[7]","cinematography":"Marc Miller Conor Colwell","directed_by":"Jake Rademacher","brothers_at_war":"Theatrical release poster","release_dates":"March 13, 2009 (2009-03-13)|||||","produced_by":"Norman S.
