{"edward_scissorhands":"Theatrical release poster","country":"United States","distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","screenplay_by":"Caroline Thompson","story_by":"Tim Burton Caroline Thompson","Plot":"An elderly woman tells her granddaughter a bedtime story of where snow comes from, by telling her the story of a young man named Edward who has scissors for hands. As the creation of an old Inventor, Edward was a human-like boy who was in the penultimate stage of work. The Inventor homeschooled Edward, but suffered a fatal heart attack and died just as he was about to fasten hands on Edward.Local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs visits the decrepit Gothic mansion on the hill where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone – at first startled, but, upon realizing he means well and is virtually harmless, takes him to her home. Edward becomes friends with Peg's young son Kevin and her husband Bill. He later falls in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter Kim, despite her initial fear of him.Peg's neighbors are impressed by Edward's adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills, though an eccentric religious fanatic named Esmeralda and Kim's overbearing boyfriend Jim are fearful and contemptuous of him. Joyce, an ageing, unfaithful housewife in the Boggs' neighborhood, has become fascinated with Edward and suggests that Edward open a hair-cutting salon with her. While examining a proposed site, she attempts to seduce him in the back room, causing Edward to leave in a panic, and Joyce rumoring of him trying to rape her.Wanting money for a van, Jim takes advantage of Edward's ability to pick locks to break into his parents' house to steal from his wealthy but bullying father. The burglar alarm sounds and everyone except Edward flees after he is trapped by the automatic locks triggered by the alarm, despite Kim's insistence that they return for him, as the police have him arrested. He is released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation allowed him to live without a sense of reality and common sense. Upon questioning by Peg, Edward takes full blame for the robbery, and is scrutinized for his behavior, believed to have committed the robbery as earlier he was denied a bank loan for his hair salon. During Christmas, Edward is cast out by almost everyone except the Boggs family. When Edward returns home, he reveals that he knew it was Jim's house and that he did it because she asked him to, much to Kim's shock, which causes her to break up with Jim.While the family is setting up Christmas decorations, Edward creates a large angel ice sculpture (modelled on Kim). The shavings create an effect of falling snow, which Kim dances under. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, startling him, resulting in Edward accidentally cutting Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her and attacks him. Edward runs away, wandering the neighborhood in a rage, ruining one of his earlier hedge works, pokes a hole in the tire on someone's car, and trims a bush in Esmeralda's front yard into the shape of the devil. However, when a shaggy puppy comes near, Edward calms down, smiles at the dog and give it a trim. While Peg and Bill search for Edward, he returns and finds Kim alone in the Boggs' house. She asks Edward to hold her, but he is afraid that he will hurt her again – she pulls his arms around her and they embrace. Jim returns to the Boggs' house in a drunken rage to confront Kim, forcing his friend to drive his van while inebriated. Kevin is almost run over, but Edward pushes him out of the way, cutting Kevin's arms and face, causing witnesses to think he is attacking him. Jim then attacks him furiously and Edward cuts Jim's right arm. When the police arrive, Edward flees to the mansion as the neighbors pursue.Kim runs to the mansion, reuniting with Edward. Jim follows her and attacks them with a handgun, beating Edward severely, who refuses to fight until Jim strikes Kim across the face when she intervenes. Edward stabs Jim in the stomach, causing him to fall out of a window to his death. Kim confesses her love for Edward and they share a kiss before saying goodbye. Kim tells the townspeople that Edward and Jim fought each other to death and tells them that the roof caved in on Edward, showing them a discarded scissor-hand from the Inventor's lab. The neighbors return home with Joyce feeling guilty for framing Edward and causing the neighbors to hate him.The elderly woman finishes telling her granddaughter the story, revealing that she is Kim and saying that she never saw Edward again. She chose not to visit him because decades have passed and she wanted him to remember her the way she was in her youth. She believes that Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the winter \"snow\" that Edward creates by carving ice sculptures that scatter shavings over the neighborhood, and remind her of dancing in the snow long ago.","language":"English","Themes":"Burton acknowledged that the main themes of Edward Scissorhands deal with self-discovery and isolation. Edward is found living alone in the attic of a Gothic castle, a setting that is also used for main characters in Burton's Batman and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Edward Scissorhands climaxes much like James Whale's Frankenstein and Burton's own Frankenweenie. A mob confronts the \"evil creature\", in this case, Edward, at his castle. With Edward unable to consummate his love for Kim because of his appearance, the film can also be seen as being influenced by Beauty and the Beast. Edward Scissorhands is a fairy tale book-ended by a prologue and an epilogue featuring Kim Boggs as an old woman telling her granddaughter the story,[25] augmenting the German Expressionism and Gothic fiction archetypes.[30]Burton explained that his depiction of suburbia is \"not a bad place. It's a weird place. I tried to walk the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being judgmental. It's a place where there's a lot of integrity.\"[23] Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered as a teenager in suburban Burbank, CA. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a \"high school fantasy\".[25]","box_office":"$86 million[2]","cinematography":"Stefan Czapsky","directed_by":"Tim Burton","release_dates":"December 6, 1990 (1990-12-06) (Los Angeles premiere)|December 14, 1990 (1990-12-14) (United States)||||","Production":"The genesis of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing by then-teenaged director Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. \"I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I don't know exactly why.\" During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was \"about an abortion that came back to life\". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands.[4] \"Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal\", Thompson remarked.[5] She wrote Scissorhands as a \"love poem\" to Burton, calling him \"the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together\".[6]Shortly after Thompson's hiring, Burton began to develop Edward Scissorhands at Warner Bros., with whom he worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. However, within a couple of months, Warner sold the film rights to 20th Century Fox.[7] Fox agreed to finance Thompson's screenplay while giving Burton complete creative control. At the time, the budget was projected to be around $8–9 million.[8] When writing the storyline, Burton and Thompson were influenced by Universal Horror films, such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Phantom of the Opera (1925), Frankenstein (1931), and Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), as well as King Kong (1933) and various fairy tales. Burton originally wanted to make Scissorhands as a musical, feeling \"it seemed big and operatic to me\", but later dropped the idea.[9] Following the enormous success of Batman, Burton arrived to the status of being an A-list director. He had the opportunity to do any film he wanted, but rather than fast track Warner Bros.' choices for Batman Returns[4] or Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, Burton opted to make Edward Scissorhands for Fox.[10]Although Winona Ryder was the first cast member attached to the script,[9] Dianne Wiest was the first to sign on. \"Dianne, in particular, was wonderful\", Burton said. \"She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested\".[11] When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered;[12] Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. \"He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him\", Burton remembered. \"He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up\". Cruise asked for a \"happier\" ending.[13] Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part,[13] the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities.[14] Oldman found the story absurd, and declined without meeting with Burton. He said of the finished film, however: \"Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late.\"[15] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role,[16] while Thompson favored John Cusack.[12] Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest,[14] although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.[12]Though Burton was unfamiliar with Johnny Depp's then-popular performance in 21 Jump Street, he had always been Burton's first choice.[11] At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting to break out of the teen idol status which his performance in 21 Jump Street had afforded him. When he was sent the script, Depp \"wept like a newborn\" and immediately found personal and emotional connections with the story.[17] In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue.[18] Fox studio executives were so worried about Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until release of the film.[19] Burton approached Ryder for the role of Kim Boggs based on their positive working experience in Beetlejuice.[11] Drew Barrymore previously auditioned for the role.[20] Crispin Glover auditioned for the role of Jim before Anthony Michael Hall was cast.[8]Kathy Baker saw her part of Joyce, the neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy.[9] Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was \"a bit baffled. Nothing really made sense to me until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary\".[9] The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys was an uncredited casting as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide when Edward was riding in Peg's car through suburbia.[21]Burbank, California was considered as a possible location for the suburban neighborhoods, but Burton believed the city had become too altered since his childhood[11] so the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, including the town of Lutz and the Southgate Shopping Center of Lakeland was chosen for a three-month shooting schedule.[5] The production crew found, in the words of the production designer Bo Welch, \"a kind of generic, plain-wrap suburb, which we made even more characterless by painting all the houses in faded pastels, and reducing the window sizes to make it look a little more paranoid.\"[22] The key element to unify the look of the neighborhood was Welch's decision to repaint each of the houses in one of four colors, which he described as \"sea-foam green, dirty flesh, butter, and dirty blue\".[23] The facade of the Gothic mansion was built just outside Dade City. Filming Edward Scissorhands created hundreds of (temporary) jobs and injected over $4 million into the Tampa Bay economy.[24] Production then moved to a Fox Studios sound stage in Century City, California, where interiors of the mansion were filmed.[22]To create Edward's scissor hands, Burton employed Stan Winston, who would later design the Penguin's prosthetic makeup in Batman Returns.[25] Depp's wardrobe and prosthetic makeup took one hour and 45 minutes to apply.[26] The giant hedge sculptures that Edward creates in the film were made by wrapping metal skeletons in chicken wire, then weaving in thousands of small plastic plant sprigs.[27] Rick Heinrichs worked as one of the art directors.Edward Scissorhands is the fourth feature film collaboration between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians.[28] Elfman cites Scissorhands as epitomizing his most personal and favorite work. In addition to Elfman's music, three Tom Jones songs also appear: \"It's Not Unusual\", \"Delilah\" and \"With These Hands\". \"It's Not Unusual\" would later be used in Mars Attacks! (1996), another film of Burton's with music composed by Elfman.[29]","produced_by":"Denise Di Novi Tim Burton","starring":"Johnny Depp|Winona Ryder|Dianne Wiest|Anthony Michael Hall|Kathy Baker|Vincent Price|Alan Arkin|","running_time":"105 minutes[1]","Stage adaptations":"A theatrical ballet adaptation by the British choreographer Matthew Bourne premiered at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London in November 2005.

Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands on the scale of \"an E.T.-sized blockbuster,\" but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. \"We have to let it find its place. We want to be careful not to hype the movie out of the universe,\" he reasoned.[31] Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that the film holds an 89% approval rating, based on 56 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10.

And it's all in the eyes: his dialogue is cut-to-the-bone minimal.\"[38]Desson Thomson of The Washington Post wrote, \"Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.\"[39] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post granted the film praise, \"Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin.\" She too praised Depp's performance in stating, \"... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.[40]Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \"A-\" rating and praised it in \"The romanticism has a personal dimension – for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light.\" He also commented very positively on character of Edward, \"... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far.\" Of Depp he wrote, \"Depp may not be doing that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but what he does is tremulous and affecting.\" As well as Eflman's score of the piece by saying it to be, \"[A] lovely, storybook score highlights the pop romanticism of Burton's conception. The romanticism has a personal dimension.\"[41]Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small.\"[42]Stan Winston and Ve Neill were nominated the Academy Award for Best Makeup, but lost to John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler for his work on Dick Tracy.[43] Production designer Bo Welch won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design, while costume designer Colleen Atwood, and Winston and Neil also received nominations at the British Academy Film Awards.
