{"country":"United Kingdom Netherlands","distributed_by":"Prestige","Plot":"The film's plot centres on three married women — a grandmother, her daughter, and her niece — each named Cissie Colpitts. As the story progresses, each woman successively drowns her husband. The three Cissie Colpittses are played by Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson and Joely Richardson, while Bernard Hill plays the coroner, Madgett, who is cajoled into covering up the three crimes.The structure, with similar stories repeated three times, is reminiscent of a fairy tale, most specifically 'The Billy Goats Gruff', because Madgett is constantly promised greater rewards as he tries his luck with each of the Cissies in turn. The link to folklore is further established by Madgett's son Smut, who recites the rules of various unusual games played by the characters as if they were ancient traditions. Many of these games are invented for the film, including:In Drowning by Numbers, number-counting, the rules of games and the repetitions of the plot are all devices which emphasize structure and symmetry. Through the course of the film each of the numbers 1 to 100 appears in sequence, often seen in the background, sometimes spoken by the characters.The film is set in and around Southwold, Suffolk, England, with key landmarks such as the Victorian water tower, Southwold Lighthouse, and the estuary of the River Blyth clearly identifiable.","language":"English","box_office":"$424,773[1]","cinematography":"Sacha Vierny","directed_by":"Peter Greenaway","drowning_by_numbers":"Drowning by Numbers film poster","Music":"On Greenaway's specific instructions, the film's musical score by Michael Nyman is entirely based on themes from the slow movement of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante in E flat, bars 58 to 61 of which are heard in their original form immediately after each drowning. Greenaway alerted Nyman to the potential of this piece in the late 1970s and had previously used it as material for part of the score of his The Falls and for \"The Masterwork\" Award Winning Fish-Knife and Tristram Shandy.[4] \"Trysting Fields\" is the most complicated use of the material: every appoggiatura from the movement, and no other material from the piece, is used.[citation needed]The album is the tenth by Nyman and the seventh to feature the Michael Nyman Band.The back cover of the album booklet has a large number \"58\". Fred Ritzel has pointed out that the Skipping Girl (played by Natalie Morse) reaches number 58 in her counting game.[5] These are subtle ways of drawing attention to the key bars of the Mozart piece.","release_dates":"10 September 1988","produced_by":"Kees Kasander Denis Wigman","starring":"Joan Plowright Juliet Stevenson Joely Richardson Bernard Hill Jason Edwards","running_time":"118 minutes","music_by":"Michael Nyman","edited_by":"John Wilson","written_by":"Peter Greenaway"}
