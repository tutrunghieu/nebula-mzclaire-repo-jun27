He takes out a life insurance policy and then tries to get himself \"accidentally\" killed. His numerous attempts are to no avail. Next he hires some strong arms to kill him since they have apparently been following him anyway. He gives the money for his murder for hire to his valet, Oki (Sessue Hayakawa).
