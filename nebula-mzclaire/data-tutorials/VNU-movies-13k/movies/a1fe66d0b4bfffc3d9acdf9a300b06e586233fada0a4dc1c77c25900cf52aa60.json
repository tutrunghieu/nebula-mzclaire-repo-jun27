{"based_on":"Citizen Cohn  by Nicholas von Hoffman","country":"United States","distributed_by":"HBO","language":"English","Synopsis":"The film spans Cohn's life from childhood through his initial rise to power as McCarthy's right-hand man in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings and his eventual public discrediting a month before his death in 1986 from AIDS. It is told mostly in flashback as Cohn lies dying in a Virginia hospital, hallucinating that his many enemies (from Robert Kennedy to Ethel Rosenberg, a convicted Communist spy he sent to the electric chair) are haunting him. It concerns aspects of Cohn's life such as his closeted homosexuality and the measure of his culpability in the \"Red Scare\" of the 1950s. While the movie portrays Cohn in a decidedly unsympathetic light, it also depicts episodes in his life, such as the death of his beloved mother, in which he showed a more tender, compassionate side.","cinematography":"Paul Elliott","production_company":"Breakheart Films Spring Creek Productions","directed_by":"Frank Pierson","Score":"Thomas Newman composed the largely minimalist film score.","release_dates":"August 22, 1992 (1992-08-22)|||||","produced_by":"Doro Bachrach","starring":"James Woods","running_time":"111 minutes","music_by":"Thomas Newman","edited_by":"Peter Zinner","written_by":"David Franzoni"}
