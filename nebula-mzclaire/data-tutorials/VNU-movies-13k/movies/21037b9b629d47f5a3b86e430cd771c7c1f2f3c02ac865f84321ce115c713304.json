Both Siskel and Ebert gave it thumbs down; reproach was aimed at the lack of detail given to the bank heist plan. They also claimed that the film relies on \"slapstick and cornball barnyard humor,\" cited its frequency of chase scenes and moments where characters fall in mud and manure. However, Ebert did credit the actions of Lou Diamond Phillips's character as a highlight.[1] Caryn James of The New York Times gave feedback largely echoing Siskel and Ebert and claimed that Rubén Blades gives \"the only genuinely comic performance.\"[2] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called it \"a human rehash of the city-mouse/country-mouse story\" but also praised Blades for his \"comic zest.\"In a 2003 interview with DVD Empire, Lou Diamond Phillips said regarding Disorganized Crime:Disorganized Crime was originally released on VHS followed by a 1996 re-release and a laser disc format. It arrived on a single-disc DVD set on September 3, 2002. It was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 10, 2011 by Mill Creek Entertainment.","written_by":"Jim Kouf","budget":"$20 million"}
