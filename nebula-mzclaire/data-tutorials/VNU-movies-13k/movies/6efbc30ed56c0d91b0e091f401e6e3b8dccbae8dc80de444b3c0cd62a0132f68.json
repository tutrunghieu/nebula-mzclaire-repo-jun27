It is north-of-the-border magical realism—Alice flies, she becomes invisible, she is another person. It is hilarious and romantic, serious and exuberantly satiric.[4]On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received generally positive reviews, currently holding a 77% \"fresh\" rating.[5]Woody Allen received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, as well as a Writers Guild of America nomination.
