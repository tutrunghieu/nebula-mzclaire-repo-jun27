Although he is a skilled player, Cruise wishes to use his scholarship to obtain a career in the medical field. He has to deal with external forces that come with his talent, most notably pushy sports agent Vaughn (Wayne Brady) and his two best friends Tech (Anthony Mackie) and Up (Lil' JJ). Vaughn pressures Cruise to pursue a career in professional sports, while Tech, also a basketball prodigy, dreams of beating his rival Jewelz (Champion) in a streetball competition. Tech is also struggling to obtain his GED to move past his Detroit surroundings and an assault charge that he took to protect Cruise. The friends meet two women along the way, Vanessa (Eva Pigford) and Eboni (Alecia Fears), and they head to Los Angeles on a trip that will change their lives forever.","language":"English","Reception":"As of September 2014, the movie has a 2% score on ratings aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on sixty-two reviews.[2]Crossover also did poorly at the box office, earning roughly US$3.7 million on opening weekend.
