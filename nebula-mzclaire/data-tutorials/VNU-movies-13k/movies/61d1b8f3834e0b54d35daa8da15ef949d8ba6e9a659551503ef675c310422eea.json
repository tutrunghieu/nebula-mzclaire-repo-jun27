You have to be receptive. The first time I saw \"Chelsea Walls,\" in a stuffy room late at night at Cannes 2001, I found it slow and pointless. This time, I saw it earlier in the day, fueled by coffee, and I understood that the movie is not about what the characters do, but about what they are. It may be a waste of time to spend your life drinking, fornicating, posing as a genius and living off your friends, but if you've got the money, honey, take off the time.\"[5]","box_office":"$60,902[3]","cinematography":"Tom Richmond","production_company":"Killer Films IFC Films","directed_by":"Ethan Hawke","release_dates":"September 21, 2001 (2001-09-21) (Woodstock Film Festival)|April 19, 2002 (2002-04-19)||||","chelsea_walls":"Theatrical release poster","produced_by":"Alexis Alexanian Pamela Koffler Christine Vachon Gary Winick","starring":"Kris Kristofferson Uma Thurman Robert Sean Leonard Vincent D'Onofrio Natasha Richardson Rosario Dawson","running_time":"109 minutes [1]","music_by":"Jeff Tweedy","edited_by":"Adriana Pacheco","written_by":"Nicole Burdette","budget":"$100,000[2]"}
