{"country":"United States Canada","blizzard":"DVD cover","Plot":"Ten-year-old Jess is inconsolable in her grief after her very best friend Bobby moves away. Her eccentric Aunt Millie comes to visit and decides the best medicine is to tell her a story about Katie, another ten-year-old girl, who wanted only one thing...to ice-skate. While practicing on an outdoor rink near her home, Katie is befriended by Otto Brewer, a former Olympic skating champion, who offers to teach her \"proper skating,\" and under Otto's tutelage, Katie blossoms into a magnificent skater. However, when Katie's father loses his job and the family is forced to move to the big city, Katie is devastated. Meanwhile, in the North Pole, Santa and his elves are celebrating the birth of Blizzard (Whoopi Goldberg), a baby reindeer born to Blitzen and Delphi. It quickly becomes apparent that Blizzard possesses all three magical reindeer gifts: the ability to fly, the power to make herself invisible, and the gift of empathic navigation - being able to see with her heart. Using her empathic ability, Blizzard feels Katie's sadness and flies to Katie's home to investigate. Despite the rigid rules of the North Pole, Blizzard helps Katie learn that the value of true friendships is that they never truly go away. However, by breaking these rules, Blizzard must face the possibility of banishment at the hands of Archimedes, Santa's strict head elf. Only true friendship can save her now. Katie's former bully Erin becomes a humble friend after being saved from drowning in a thin-iced frozen pond by Katie, with Blizzard's help.","language":"English","cinematography":"David Franco","production_company":"Knightscove Entertainment Holedigger Films Ralph Winter Productions","directed_by":"LeVar Burton","Awards":"The film won the Best of the Fest award at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival, and the DGC Team Award from the Director's Guild of Canada.
