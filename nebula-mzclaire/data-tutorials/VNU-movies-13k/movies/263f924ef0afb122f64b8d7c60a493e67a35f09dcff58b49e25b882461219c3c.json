New surgery techniques restore her vision but initially cause \"vision flashes\" that leave her uncertain about what she sees. One night, she is awakened by a noise in the apartment above. Peeking out her door, she \"sees\" a figure descending the stairs. She contacts the police, worried that her neighbor has been murdered, but is unsure whether it was just her new vision deceiving her. The killer then begins to stalk Emma.","language":"English","Reception":"The film received mixed to positive reviews.[2][3][4] It holds a 62% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 21 critics.The Miami Herald gave the film 2.5 stars (out of 4), saying, \"After a number of red herrings, the identity of the killer turns out to be rather inconsequential -- and the motive somewhat farfetched. A shame, because the premise here, paired with an equally clever plot, would've made a dandy exercise in suspense. As it is, Blink is mildly engaging entertainment, nothing that will have you checking your watch, but nowhere near as good as its terrific trailers (\"Things are not what they seem\" and all that) make it out to be.\"[5] However, film critic Roger Ebert gave the movie three-and-a-half (of four) stars, saying \"... it is an uncommonly good thriller.\"The film debuted at No. 4.[6]","blink":"Theatrical release poster","box_office":"$16,696,219","cinematography":"Dante Spinotti","directed_by":"Michael Apted","release_dates":"January 26, 1994","produced_by":"David Blocker|Sara Risher (executive producer)|Robert Shaye (executive producer)|","starring":"Madeleine Stowe|Aidan Quinn|James Remar|Paul Dillon|Laurie Metcalf|Bruce A.
