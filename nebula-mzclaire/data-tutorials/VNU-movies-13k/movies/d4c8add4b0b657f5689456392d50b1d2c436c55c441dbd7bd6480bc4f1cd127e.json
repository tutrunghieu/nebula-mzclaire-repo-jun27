Deciding on checking out Death Valley, they've yet to find out that it is currently the new stamping grounds of cowboy serial killer (wearing a stetson and Pink Male Thong to hide his identity) and his equally demented twin (who both have a tendency to tap-dance and belt out good old country ditties). Both have just done away with a teenage couple residing at an abandoned gold mine (with the aid of the couple's own chopping knife). Billy, stretching his legs, stumbles across their camper filled with death, missing the carnage he comes across a frog pendant lying on a shag pile. His moment of Farce influences of undeniability is unproven somewhat seals his fate as its owner returns to find his trinket gone and so he takes off after Billy and his family, who wind up seemingly in the safe vicinity of a nearby Wild West novelty town.
