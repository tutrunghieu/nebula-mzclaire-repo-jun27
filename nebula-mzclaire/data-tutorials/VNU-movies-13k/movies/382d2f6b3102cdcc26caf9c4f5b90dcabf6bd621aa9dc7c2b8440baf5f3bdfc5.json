She was a promising filly who was being pointed towards the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1993 but then broke her cannon bone (the incident is mentioned in the film by Sonador's veterinarian). She recovered and later won some graded stakes races. She started in the 1995 Breeders' Cup Distaff and finished ninth. She was owned by Thunderhead Farms and trained by Don Von Hemel. She is now known mostly for being the dam of Giant's Causeway. In the movie, when Cale and Ben go to Ashford Stud to check out the studs, the stallions they are naming, such as Fusaichi Pegasus, Giant's Causeway, Mariah's Storm, Johannesburg and Grand Slam, are real horses who actually stand at Ashford. However, the actual stallions were not used in filming. Stand-ins were placed in their stalls instead. In the scene where Sonya is considered for the Breeder's Cup, Prince Sadir says that his horse \"Rapid Cat is sired by Storm Cat, the best sire in the world.\" Coincidentally, Mariah's Storm (on whom Sonya is based) was bred to Storm Cat.While doing research in Kentucky, the director/writer came upon a vet who told him about a racehorse who miraculously made a comeback after a serious injury, and he loosely based the script on this story. Before being picked up by DreamWorks, the script was presented to Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros, but both declined. Director John Gatins was told that if he could get Dakota Fanning in the lead role his movie would get a green-light. He went to see Fanning's agent and finally got the young actress to sign on. The role of Cale Crane was originally written for a boy, and the role was changed specifically so that Dakota Fanning could play it. The first script that was sent to Fanning actually had the word \"boy\" in the character description.To produce the soundtrack, an advance showing of this film was shown to a number of recording artists, who were then asked to submit ideas for theme songs. Bethany Dillon's song \"Dreamer\" was chosen out of all the submissions. After the movie, Kurt Russell bought Dakota Fanning a real Palomino horse, whom she named Goldie.","produced_by":"Brian Robbins Hunt Lowry Michael Tollin","starring":"Kurt Russell Dakota Fanning Kris Kristofferson Elisabeth Shue","running_time":"102 minutes","music_by":"John Debney","edited_by":"David Rosenbloom","Release":"The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2005, released theatrically on October 21, 2005 by DreamWorks Pictures and was released on DVD on March 21, 2006 by Roadshow Entertainment.","written_by":"John Gatins","budget":"$32 million"}
