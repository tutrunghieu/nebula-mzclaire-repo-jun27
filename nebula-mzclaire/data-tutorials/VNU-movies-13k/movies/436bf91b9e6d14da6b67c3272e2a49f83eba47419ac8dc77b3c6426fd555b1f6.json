The Reapers are stronger and harder to kill than common vampires, being almost invulnerable to any weapon with the exception of sunlight. They have a ravenous hunger, requiring more feeding than vampires, and anyone they bite, Human or Vampire, becomes a Reaper. In order to combat the mutants, the vampire overlord Eli Damaskinos sends his minion, Asad, and daughter Nyssa to find and strike a truce with Blade, who reluctantly allies with the vampires. He teams up with the Bloodpack, an elite group of vampires originally assembled to kill him. The group consists of Asad, Nyssa, Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Verlaine, her lover Lighthammer and Priest. Blade plants an explosive on the back of Reinhardt's head to keep him under control.The group starts at a vampire nightclub; while Whistler acts as a sniper to guard Scud in the team's transport. The group finds out the Reapers are immune to silver, stronger than normal vampires, and resistant to normal crippling injuries. Priest is bitten, transformed and mercy-killed; Lighthammer is bitten but conceals the bite. Whistler disappears and Scud is attacked by several Reapers, which he drives off with UV lights. Blade fights Nomak, who is immune to Blade's anti-coagulant spikes. After a stalemate battle, Nomak retreats because of the sunlight.

It is said that the film was going to introduce Hannibal King and Frank Drake in the series as well as a time travel storyline where Blade goes years in the future. Guillermo del Toro was hired to direct Blade II by New Line production president Michael De Luca[4] after Stephen Norrington turned down the offer to direct the sequel. Goyer and Frankfurt both admired director Guillermo del Toro and believed his dark sensibilities to be ideal for Blade II. Frankfurt first met del Toro when Frankfurt's design company, Imaginary Forces, did the title sequences for Mimic. \"I admired Mimic and got to know Guillermo through that film,\" says Frankfurt. \"Both David Goyer and I have been fans of his since Cronos and were enthusiastic about him coming on board. Guillermo is such a visual director and has a very strong sense of how he wants a movie to look. When you sign on with someone like Guillermo you're not going to tell him what the movie should look like, you're going to let him run with it.\" Like Goyer, del Toro has a passion for comic books. \"Guillermo was weaned on comic books, as was I,\" says Goyer. \"I was a huge comic book collector... my brother and I had about twelve thousand comic books that we assembled when we were kids, so I know my background.\" Tippett Studio provided computer-generated visual effects, including digital doubles of some of the characters.[5]Del Toro chose not to alter the script too much from the ideas created by Goyer and Snipes. \"I wanted the movie to have a feeling of both a comic book and Japanese animation,\" said the director. \"I resurrected those sources and viewed them again. I dissected most of the dailies from the first movie; I literally grabbed about four boxes of tapes and one by one saw every single tape from beginning to end until I perfectly understood where the language of the first film came from. I studied the style of the first one and I think Norrington used a tremendous narrative style. His work is very elegant.\"Stepping back into Blade's shoes was a challenge Wesley Snipes relished. \"I love playing this role. It's fun as an actor to test your skills at doing a sequel, to see if you can recreate something that you did,\" Snipes says. Peter Frankfurt adds, \"Wesley is Blade; so much of the character was invented by Wesley and his instincts are so spot on. He takes his fighting, his weapons and attitude very seriously. He's incredibly focused, but he's also very cool and fun.\"\"Wesley knows Blade better than David Goyer, better than me, better than anyone else involved in the franchise,\" adds del Toro. \"He instinctively knows what the character would and wouldn't do, and every time he twists something around, something better would come out.\"Filming took place in Prague, Czech Republic including the Barrandov Studios, as well as London from March 12, 2001 and concluded July 2, 2001.","produced_by":"Peter Frankfurt|Wesley Snipes|Patrick Palmer|Avi Arad (executive)|","starring":"Wesley Snipes|Kris Kristofferson|Ron Perlman|Leonor Varela|Norman Reedus|Luke Goss|","running_time":"117 minutes[1]","music_by":"Marco Beltrami","edited_by":"Peter Amundson","Release":"Blade II was released on March 22, 2002.

In its opening weekend, the film earned $32,528,016 from 2,707 theaters[2] but dropped 59% of its earnings in its second week, which brought in $13.2 million.
