{"a_world_apart":"A World Apart (Video Cover)","country":"United Kingdom / Zimbabwe","distributed_by":"Atlantic Releasing Corporation","Plot":"Set in Johannesburg in 1963, the film examines the abrupt ending of 13-year-old Molly's blithe childhood when her father, a member of the South African Communist Party, is sent into exile. Ostracised by her peers, Molly draws closer to her mother as she attempts to further the campaign against apartheid. Their relationship is challenged by hardship, political intimidation, and the older woman's eventual arrest.The film title references both the gap between the mother and her teenage girl, who fails to grasp why their family is so fixated with events beyond their comfortable suburb, and another separating this world from that of South Africa's poverty-stricken black townships. Essentially, the film is a tribute to Ruth First by her daughter and concludes in a moment of epiphany as Molly comes to terms with her mother's activism and understands that she too must play a part in the struggle to protest racial injustice.","language":"English","Reception":"A World Apart has an overall approval rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes.[1]","cinematography":"Peter Biziou","directed_by":"Chris Menges","release_dates":"17 June 1988 (1988-06-17)|||||","produced_by":"Sarah Radclyffe","starring":"Barbara Hershey|David Suchet|Jeroen Krabbé|Paul Freeman|Tim Roth|Jodhi May|","running_time":"113 minutes","music_by":"Hans Zimmer","edited_by":"Nicholas Gaster","written_by":"Shawn Slovo"}
