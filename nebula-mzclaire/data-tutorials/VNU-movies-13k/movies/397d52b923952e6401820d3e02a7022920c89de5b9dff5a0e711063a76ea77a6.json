{"directed_by":"Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky","The Ward brothers":"In a rural farming community near Syracuse, New York, four brothers lived in a dilapidated house. William Jay (1925-1990), Adelbert (known as Delbert), Lyman, and Roscoe Ward were barely literate, had no formal education, and farmed land that had been in their family for generations.","The brothers' fates":"Delbert Ward died at age 66 at Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown on August 6, 1998.[2]Roscoe Ward died at age 88 on June 23, 2007.[3][4]Lyman Ward died at age 85 in Utica, New York on August 15, 2007.[5][6]","release_dates":"January 1992 (1992-01)|||||","Film title":"The title Brother's Keeper comes from the Book of Genesis in the Bible. When God asks Cain where his brother Abel is, Cain replies, \"I know not; am I my brother's keeper?\" (Genesis 4:9 KJV)","William's death":"William Ward, who had been ill for years, was found dead one morning. Delbert was accused of killing him, perhaps by smothering. The prosecution's theory at trial was that Delbert had performed a mercy killing in order to put William out of his misery after a period of severe headaches and declining health. As the film progresses, it is revealed that during the coroner's examination of William's body, semen was found on clothing and on William's leg, leading to the suggestion that Delbert had killed William in an episode of \"sex gone bad.\" The film never follows up on this media sensation.Delbert Ward was acquitted at trial, largely because the lack of any physical evidence and that the New York State Police violated Delbert's rights by coercing a confession (which he later retracted) and by having him sign a written statement which he could not understand due to illiteracy.","starring":"Delbert Ward|Lyman Ward|Roscoe Ward|Bill Ward|","running_time":"104 min.","language":"English","music_by":"Molly Mason, Jay Ungar","box_office":"$1,305,915[1]","production_company":"Wellspring Media Inc."}
