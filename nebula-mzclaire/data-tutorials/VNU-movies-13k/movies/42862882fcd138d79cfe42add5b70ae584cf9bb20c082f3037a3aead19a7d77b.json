The dances were choreographed by Bill Robinson who appeared with Temple in four films and partnered her for the famous staircase dance in The Little Colonel.Sony Computer Entertainment later used the song Get On Board for a PlayStation 2 advertisement entitled \"Mountain\".[2]","release_dates":"October 16, 1936 (1936-10-16)|||||","Production":"This movie was originally to be titled The Bowery Princess but was changed as it was deemed too coarse for Temple's image. There was a great deal of friction on the set of this movie as Morgan and Temple repeatedly tried to steal scenes from one another. Morgan would place his stovepipe hat on a table blocking Temple's face and forcing her to move her marks and out of the camera lights. He would also keep moving his hands near her eye level by tinkering with a handkerchief or placing on gloves. Temple for her part would either yawn or scratch her face. In the scene where Morgan's character gets ripped off by con men, Temple jiggled the fishing pole she was holding in the background in an attempt to draw attention away from Morgan. She also worked with Robinson to devise ways of creating rhythmic pauses and gestures in her dance movements to prevent scene stealing from Morgan. Producer Nunally Johnson, commenting on the scene stealing, remarked that \"When this picture is over, either Shirley will have acquired a taste for Scotch whiskey or Frank will come out with curls.\"[1]","produced_by":"Nunnally Johnson Darryl F.

Frank Morgan played Temple’s “Micawberesque grandfather with such energy and fun as to render Shirley […] faltering and hollow (Windeler 175).In 2009, videocassette and DVD editions were available in the original black and white and in computer-colorized versions of the original.
