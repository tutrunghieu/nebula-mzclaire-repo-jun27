He accidentally winds up inside a truck heading to a top-secret laboratory, where he is placed under the guidance of lab worker Lester (Bud Abbott) to help load supplies onto a rocket ship. While on board with Lester, Orville hits the ignition button and the rocket blasts off, flying across the country to New Orleans, where Mardi Gras is in progress. They exit the ship and witness \"hideous creatures\", which are actually costumed celebrants, and conclude that they have landed on Mars.Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse (Jack Kruschen) and Mugsy (Horace McMahon), enter the rocket, put on the available spacesuits and head to New Orleans to rob a bank. Lester and Orville, also clad in spacesuits, are wrongly accused of the crime and rush back to the rocket ship, where Mugsy and Harry force them to launch.After landing on Venus, the four men leave the rocket ship and Orville is quickly captured by guards and brought to Queen Allura (Mari Blanchard), who informs him that Venus is only inhabited by women, as men were banished a long time ago. She takes more than a liking to him, however, and decides that he can stay if he promises to be true to her. He agrees, and has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned for their crimes. Mugsy then convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove that he cannot be trusted. Orville \"takes the bait\" and the Queen orders all the men to leave her planet.Upon returning to Earth they are lauded as heroes, and Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a spaceship to drop a cake on Orville's head.","language":"English","abbott_and_costello_go_to_mars":"Theatrical release poster","box_office":"$1.25 million (US)[2]","cinematography":"Clifford Stine","directed_by":"Charles Lamont","Home media":"The film has had two DVD releases, the first as part of The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume Three, released on August 3, 2004, and the second as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection, released on October 28, 2008.","release_dates":"April 6, 1953 (1953-04-06)|||||","Production":"Principal photography took place between August 1 and August 28, 1952.[3]Shortly after the film's release, Abbott and Costello appeared on The Colgate Comedy Hour and did a comedy sketch in which they attended the film's premiere.The Venusian cars featured in the film were later used in the science fiction feature This Island Earth (1955).[4]The Venusian women were played by contestants in the Miss Universe competition.
