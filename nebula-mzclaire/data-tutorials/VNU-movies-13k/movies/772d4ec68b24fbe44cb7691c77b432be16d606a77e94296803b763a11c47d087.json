{"country":"France","distributed_by":"Les Films du Losange","Plot":"Gaspard, the main character, arrives on holiday in Dinard, a small Breton seaside resort. He awaits his girlfriend, Lena, who does not arrive. Only a short while after this, he crosses paths with the waitress Margot, and they develop a strong friendship; Gaspard also has a fling with Solène, Margot's adventure-seeking friend. Lena eventually does turn up, and by this time, Gaspard has become attached to all three women.Gaspard (Melvil Poupaud) is a young mathematician/musician vacationing by the seaside in Brittany, France before starting a new job. The film covers roughly three weeks in his life and introduces us to the trio of women he encounters during that time. First is Margot (Amanda Langlet), a cheerful waitress who enjoys spending time with Gaspard, but isn't interested in more than a friendship. Solene (Gwenaëlle Simon) is more affectionate and sensual - she's willing to have a relationship with Gaspard if he will commit to only her. Then there's Lena (Aurelia Nolin), Gaspard's longtime semi-girlfriend whose ambiguous romantic attitude towards him keeps him in a state of permanent consternation. As the summer wears on, Gaspard finds himself increasingly torn between the three women, finding each the most appealing when he's with her, and recognizing that the day is fast approaching when he will have to choose.[3]","language":"French","box_office":"$198,126[1]","conte_d'été":"Film poster","cinematography":"Diane Baratier","directed_by":"Éric Rohmer","release_dates":"5 June 1996 (1996-06-05)","produced_by":"Françoise Etchegaray Margaret Ménégoz","starring":"Melvil Poupaud","running_time":"113 minutes","music_by":"Philippe Eidel Sébastien Erms","edited_by":"Mary Stephen","written_by":"Éric Rohmer"}
