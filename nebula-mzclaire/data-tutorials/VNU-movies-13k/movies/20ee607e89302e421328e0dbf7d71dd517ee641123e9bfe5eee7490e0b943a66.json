{"country":"Czechoslovakia","Plot":"Diamonds of the Night begins with two young men fleeing from a train taking them to a concentration camp. The film employs little dialog and the boys escape through rugged and unfamiliar terrain is interpolated with dreams, memories, hallucinations, fantasies, and flashbacks. They encounter a woman on a farm and one boy struggles with thoughts of murder and rape before silently taking a loaf of bread from the woman's kitchen and leaving. Eventually, the boys are caught by members of a local shooting party. The men prepare to execute the boys, but simply laugh as they walk away instead of executing them. The ending is ambiguous: The men either actually spared the boys, or they could be walking into the afterlife.","language":"Czech","diamonds_of_the_night":"English DVD cover","cinematography":"Jaromír Šofr","directed_by":"Jan Němec","release_dates":"25 September 1964 (1964-09-25)|||||","produced_by":"Jan Procházka Erich Svabík","starring":"Ladislav Jánský Antonín Kumbera","running_time":"63 minutes","music_by":"Vlastimil Hála Jan Rychlík","External links":"","edited_by":"Oldřich Bosák","written_by":"Arnošt Lustig Jan Němec"}
