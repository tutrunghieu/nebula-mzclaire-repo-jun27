A corporation trying to find a remote place to illegally dump nuclear waste throws him off his land and destroys his laboratory. He spends the rest of the film committing ecotage against the company and trying to recover his land.","language":"English","cinematography":"Dante Spinotti","directed_by":"Charles Bail","Soundtrack":"The Mike + The Mechanics song \"Silent Running\" was chosen to appear in Choke Canyon because its atmosphere suited the film's tone.[1] For promotional reasons, the song's title was extended to \"Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)\" (the parenthetical title being the title of the film in the UK), even though the lyrics have no connection to the film. The promotional video for the song features a few clips from the film, but primarily follows the story of the lyrics, which are about an astronaut trying to send a message to the past in order to warn his family of an imminent societal breakdown.[1]","release_dates":"August 1, 1986 (1986-08-01)|||||","produced_by":"Ovidio G.
