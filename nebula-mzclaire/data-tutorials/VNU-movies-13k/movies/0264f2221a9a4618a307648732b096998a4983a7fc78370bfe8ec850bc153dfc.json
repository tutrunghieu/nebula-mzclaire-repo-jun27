The film's opening scene features a brief encounter with four of the main characters: Anne Laurent (Juliette Binoche) is an actress working in Paris, and she walks briefly with her boyfriend's younger brother Jean. After they part, Jean throws a piece of garbage at Maria, a homeless woman sitting on the side of the road. Amadou, the child of Malian immigrants, witnesses this and confronts Jean. The two fight, and eventually Amadou and Maria are both taken to a police station for questioning. Amadou is released presumably shortly after, though we learn that he was held, beaten and shamed, but Maria is deported to her native Romania and she reconnects with her family there.","language":"French Maninka Romanian German English Arabic French Sign Language","cinematography":"Jürgen Jürges","directed_by":"Michael Haneke","release_dates":"November 15, 2000 (2000-11-15)|||||","code_unknown":"Code inconnu","produced_by":"Marin Karmitz","starring":"Juliette Binoche Thierry Neuvic Alexandre Hamidi","running_time":"117 minutes","music_by":"Giba Gonçalves","edited_by":"Karin Martusch Nadine Muse Andreas Prochaska","written_by":"Michael Haneke"}
