He travels to Heathercrest National Service Depot, meeting fellow recruit Horace Strong (Kenneth Connor), a terminal hypochondriac who is devastated at having been passed as fit.The new recruits are assigned to Sergeant Grimshaw (William Hartnell). Grimshaw is retiring from the army and takes on a £50 bet with Sergeant O'Brien (Terry Scott) that his last bunch of squaddies will be his first champion platoon. (Terry Scott was paid £50 for his part in the film)With beady-eyed inspection from Captain Potts (Eric Barker) and disgruntled support from Corporal Copping (Bill Owen), Grimshaw decides to use some psychology and treat his charges kindly rather than simply shouting at them. But basic training does not start well and he struggles to take his platoon through it. They include failure Herbert Brown (Norman Rossington), upper-class cad Miles Heywood (Terence Longdon), rock 'n' roller Andy Galloway (Gerald Campion), delicate flower Peter Golightly (Charles Hawtrey) and supercilious university graduate James Bailey (Kenneth Williams). His attempts seem doomed.Mary is determined to spend her wedding night with her husband and smuggles herself into the depot to get a job in the NAAFI, a situation Charlie is eventually able to legitimise. Strong spends most of his time complaining to the Medical Officer, Captain Clark (Hattie Jacques). It is only the adoration of doe-eyed NAAFI girl Norah (Dora Bryan), which he initially rejects, that makes him realise his potential and inspires him to become a real soldier.On the eve of the final tests, Grimshaw is in despair, but he is overheard bemoaning his lot to Copping. The squad decide to win the best platoon prize at all costs. On the day, they indeed beat the other platoons at all tasks and Grimshaw is awarded the cup for best platoon.","Title":"\"Carry on, Sergeant\" is a normal expression for an Army officer to use; the American equivalent is, \"As you were.\" The title that replaced The Bull Boys was suggested by Stuart Levy to cash in on the popularity of the 1957 film Carry on Admiral, which was written by Val Guest.[3] At the time, the success of Carry On Sergeant prompted applause and audience laughter in serious settings where the phrase was used, including amongst audiences of the film The Devil's Disciple (1959).[4]","language":"English","cinematography":"Peter Hennessy","directed_by":"Gerald Thomas","release_dates":"August 1958","produced_by":"Peter Rogers Kenneth Myers","starring":"William Hartnell Bob Monkhouse Shirley Eaton Eric Barker Dora Bryan Bill Owen Kenneth Connor Charles Hawtrey Kenneth Williams Terence Longdon Norman Rossington Hattie Jacques Gerald Campion","running_time":"84 minutes","Carry on series":"Carry On Sergeant had not been conceived as the start of a movie series; only after the film's surprising success did the producer Peter Rogers and the director Gerald Thomas set about planning a further project.
