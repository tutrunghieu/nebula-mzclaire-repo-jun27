The station in question is named \"Museum\" and is stated as being between Holborn and British Museum in a conversation between Inspectors Calhoun and Richardson. Signs in the abandoned station also state \"Museum\" as the name. Location filming took place at both Holborn and the now disused Aldwych station.","produced_by":"Paul Maslansky","starring":"Donald Pleasence Norman Rossington David Ladd Sharon Gurney Hugh Armstrong Christopher Lee","running_time":"87 minutes","music_by":"Wil Malone","written_by":"Gary Sherman"}
