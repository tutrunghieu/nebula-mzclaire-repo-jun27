Layla allows herself to be kidnapped and it is clear she is romantically attracted to Billy from the start, but Billy all the while is compelled to deal with his own demons, his loneliness and his depression.The subplot of Billy seeking revenge on the man indirectly responsible for his imprisonment, Scott Wood, is a reference to a former Buffalo Bills kicker, Scott Norwood, who missed the game-winning field goal in Super Bowl XXV against the New York Giants in 1991.[4]","language":"English","Reception":"Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 78% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 41 reviews; the average rating is 7.1/10.[11] At Metacritic it has a rating score of 68 (19 critics), indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[12]","box_office":"$2.4 million[2]","cinematography":"Lance Acord","production_company":"Cinépix Film Properties Muse Productions","buffalo_'66":"Theatrical release poster","directed_by":"Vincent Gallo","release_dates":"June 26, 1998 (1998-06-26)|||||","Production":"Gallo had difficulties working with his cast and crew. Gallo and Christina Ricci reportedly did not get along on the set. He called her a \"puppet\" who did what she was told.[5] Ricci vowed to never work with Gallo again.[6] She also resented the comments he made about her weight three or four years after filming.[7] Anjelica Huston also did not get along with him,[8] and Gallo claimed Huston caused the film to be turned down by the Cannes Film Festival.[8] It was director Stéphane Sednaoui that suggested to Gallo to use cinematographer Lance Acord. Although Acord was widely credited with the film's distinct visual style Gallo has claimed credit for designing most of the film's cinematography.[9] He also publicly disparaged Acord, saying \"This guy had no ideas, no conceptual ideas, no aesthetic point of view.\"[10][8] Kevin Corrigan also didn't get along with Gallo. He was so unconvinced by his performance in the film that he asked not to be credited.","produced_by":"Chris Hanley","starring":"Vincent Gallo|Christina Ricci|Ben Gazzara|Mickey Rourke|Rosanna Arquette|Jan-Michael Vincent|Anjelica Huston|","running_time":"110 minutes","music_by":"Vincent Gallo","edited_by":"Curtiss Clayton","budget":"$1.5 million[1]"}
