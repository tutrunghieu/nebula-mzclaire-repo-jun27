His mother, the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna, is visiting from Paris and gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words “Together in Paris” as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, eight-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia. The ball is suddenly interrupted by the sorcerer Grigori Rasputin, the former royal advisor of the Romanovs until he was banished by Nicholas II for treason. Feeling betrayed and seeking revenge, Rasputin sold his soul in exchange for an unholy reliquary, which he uses to place a curse on the Romanov family, sparking the Russian Revolution. Only Marie and Anastasia are able to escape the ensuing siege of the palace, thanks to a young servant boy named Dimitri who shows them a secret passageway in Anastasia's room. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and freeze to death. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but only Marie climbs aboard while Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and giving her amnesia.Ten years later, Russia is under communist rule and Marie has publicly offered 10 million rubles for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime Vladimir search for a look-alike to bring to Paris and pass off as Anastasia so as to collect the reward from Marie. Elsewhere, Anastasia, now using the name \"Anya\", leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up, having lost her memory prior to arriving there. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names \"Pooka\", she decides to head to Saint Petersburg, inspired by the passage on the necklace she still has. In the deserted palace she encounters Dimitri and Vladimir, who are impressed by her resemblance to the \"real\" Anastasia and decide to take her with them to Paris.Bartok, Rasputin's albino bat minion, is nearby and notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasia's presence; it drags him to limbo, where the soul of Rasputin survives. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his demonic minions from the reliquary to kill her; despite two assassination attempts, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil him, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface.Anastasia, Dimitri and Vladimir eventually reach Paris and go to meet Marie, who refuses to see her, having been nearly fooled numerous times before by impostors. Despite this, Sophie (Marie's cousin) quizzes Anastasia to confirm her identity. Though Anastasia offers the expected answers as taught to her by Dimitri, he realizes she is indeed the real Anastasia when she vaguely recollects how a boy had saved her ten years prior. Sophie, also convinced of Anastasia's identity, arranges a meeting with Marie at the Palais Garnier Opera house, but Marie initially refuses, having heard of Dimitri's scheme to present a stand-in in order to collect the reward money. Anastasia overhears the argument and angrily leaves. Dimitri kidnaps Marie and takes her to see Anastasia. When she refuses, Dimitri shows her the music box that he had found at the palace, and when its music plays, Anastasia is awash with her memories, convincing Marie of her identity. The two are joyfully reunited.Marie offers Dimitri the reward money, but to her surprise, he refuses it and leaves for Russia, thanking Anastasia for her return to her grandmother. That night at Anastasia's return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitri's gesture. Anastasia, deep in thought about Dimitri, wanders onto the Pont Alexandre III where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is injured and knocked unconscious while Bartok abandons Rasputin. In the struggle, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crushes it under her foot, destroying it. With Rasputin's soul having been tied to the reliquary, he promptly dies and disintegrates.Afterwards, Dimitri and Anastasia reconcile after Anastasia finally discovers the truth about herself; they elope and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. The couple kisses on a riverboat and Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat before bidding the audience farewell.","Accolades":"Anastasia received the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Family Film[50] and was nominated for 7 others, including two Academy Awards in the categories of \"Best Original Musical or Comedy Score\" (lost to The Full Monty) and \"Best Original Song\" for \"Journey to the Past\" (lost to My Heart Will Go On from Titanic).[51][52] The R&B singer Aaliyah performed her pop single version of \"Journey to the Past\" at the 70th Academy Awards.[53]","language":"English","Reception":"Anastasia received a generally positive reception from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 85% based on 52 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Beautiful animation, an affable take on Russian history, and strong voice performances make Anastasia a winning first film from Fox animation studios.\"[29] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing, \"The result is entertaining and sometimes exciting\".[30] Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Enquirer described Anastasia as \"charming\" and \"entertaining,\" concluding, \"Anastasia serves up a tasty tale about a fairy-tale princess.\"[31] Lisa Osbourne of Boxoffice called the film \"pure family entertainment.\"[32] Awarding the film three out of five stars, Empire's Philip Thomas wrote, \"Historical inaccuracies aside, Anastasia manages to be a charming little movie\".[33]Several critics have drawn positive comparisons between Anastasia and the Disney films released during the Disney Renaissance, noting similarities in their story and animation styles. Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle awarded the film three out of five stars. Likening its quality to that of a Disney animated film, Baumgarten wrote, \"Anastasia...may not beat Disney at its own game, but it sure won't be for lack of trying.\" Baumgarten continued, \"[t]his sumptuous-looking film clearly spared no expense in its visual rendering; its optical flourishes and attention to detail aim for the Disney gold standard and, for the most part, come pretty darn close.\"[34] The Phoenix's Jeffrey Gantz jokingly stated, \"[i]f imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, then the folks at Disney should feel royally complimented by Twentieth Century Fox's new animated feature about Tsar Nicholas II's youngest daughter.\"[35] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"Fox's challenge to the Disney empire is a beautifully animated musical\". However, Gleiberman continued, \"Anastasia has the Disney house style down cold, yet the magic is missing.\"[36]Critical reception in Russia was also, for the most part, positive despite the artistic liberties that the film took with Russian history. Gemini Films, the Russian distributor of Anastasia, stressed the fact that the story was \"not history\", but rather \"a fairy tale set against the background of real Russian events\" in the film's Russian marketing campaign so that its Russian audience would not view Anastasia \"as a historical film\".[37] As a result, many Russians praised the film for its art and storytelling and saw it as \"not so much a piece of history but another Western import to be consumed and enjoyed\".[37]Some Russian Orthodox Christians, on the other hand, found Anastasia to be an offensive depiction of the Grand Duchess, who was canonized as a new martyr in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and a passion bearer in 2000 by the Russian Orthodox Church.[38] Many historians echoed their sentiments, criticizing the film as a \"sanitized, sugar-coated reworking of the story of the Czar's youngest daughter.\"[39] While the filmmakers acknowledged the fact that \"Anastasia uses history only as a starting point\", others complained that the film would provide its audience with misleading facts about Russian history, which, according to the author and historian Suzanne Massie, \"has been falsified for so many years.\"[12] Similarly, the amateur historian Bob Atchison said that Anastasia was akin to someone making a film in which \"Anne Frank moves to Orlando and opens a crocodile farm with a guy named Mort.\"[12]Some of Anastasia's contemporary relatives also felt that the film was distasteful, but most Romanovs have come to accept the \"repeated exploitation of Anastasia's romantic tale ... with equanimity.\"[12]A limited release of Anastasia at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on the weekend of November 14, 1997 grossed $120,541.[40] The following week, the wide release of Anastasia in the United States made $14,104,933 (for an average of about $5,692 from 2,478 theaters), which placed it as the #2 film for the weekend of November 21–23, 1997. By the end of its theatrical run, Anastasia had grossed $58,406,347 in the North American box office and $81,398,001 internationally.[2] The worldwide gross totaled up to about $139,804,348, making it Don Bluth's highest-grossing film to date, beating out his previous record holder of that title The Land Before Time from 1988 by about $55,343,502.[41]","box_office":"$139.8 million[2]","production_company":"Fox Animation Studios","directed_by":"Don Bluth Gary Goldman","release_dates":"November 14, 1997 (1997-11-14) (New York City premiere)|November 21, 1997 (1997-11-21) (United States)||||","Production":"In May 1994, The Los Angeles Times reported that Don Bluth and Gary Goldman had signed a long-term deal to produce animated features with 20th Century Fox with the studio channeling more than $100 million in constructing the animation studio.[7] For the location of the new animation studio, Phoenix, Arizona was selected because the state offered the company about $1 million in job training funds and low-interest loans for the state-of-the-art digital animation equipment,[8] with a staff of 300 artists and technicians, including a third of which worked with Bluth and Goldman in Dublin, Ireland for Sullivan Bluth Studios.[9] For their first project, the studio insisted they select one out of a dozen existing properties in which they owned where Bluth and Goldman suggested adapting The King and I and My Fair Lady,[10] though Bluth and Goldman felt it would be impossible to improve on Audrey Hepburn's performance and Lerner and Loewe's score. Following several story suggestions, the idea to adapt Anastasia originated from Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO Bill Mechanic. They would later adapt story elements from Pygmalion with the peasant Anya being molded into a regal woman.[11]When Bluth and Goldman began researching the actual events, they discovered the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film, and decided to use the basic facts of the Romanovs' demise and the Russian Revolution as a starting point and ask, \"What if this girl escaped, and what would have happened to her?\" opting to \"'tell a myth or a fairy tale.'\"[11][12] Bluth also did not take into consideration depicting Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks as the villains, and instead incorporated Grigori Rasputin, explaining \"We wanted to stay out of politics.\" In reality, Rasputin was already dead when the Romanovs were assassinated. In addition to this, Bluth created the idea for Bartok, the albino bat, as a sidekick for Rasputin. \"I just thought the villain had to have a comic sidekick, just to let everyone know that it was all right to laugh. A bat seemed a natural friend for Rasputin. Making him a white bat came later - just to make him different.\"[13]Bluth stated that Meg Ryan was his first and only choice for the title character. However, Ryan was indecisive about accepting the role due to its dark historical events.[14] To persuade her, the animation team took an audio clip of Annie Reed from Sleepless in Seattle and created an animation reel based on it which was screened for her following an invitation to the studio. \"I was blown away that they did that,\" Ryan later confessed, and accepted the role.[15] Before Ryan was cast, Broadway actress and singer Liz Callaway was brought in to record several demos of the songs hoping to land a job in background vocals, but were liked well enough by the songwriters that were ultimately used in the final film.[16] Cusack openly admitted after being cast that he couldn't sing,[17] in which his singing duties were performed by Jonathan Dokuchitz as well as Jim Cummings substituting for Christopher Lloyd.[18]The film score was composed, co-orchestrated, and conducted by David Newman, whose father, Alfred Newman composed the score of the 1956 film of the same name.[19] The songs, of which \"Journey to the Past\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, were written by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty.[20] The film's soundtrack was released in CD and audio cassette format on October 28, 1997.[21]","produced_by":"Don Bluth Gary Goldman","starring":"Meg Ryan John Cusack Kelsey Grammer Hank Azaria Christopher Lloyd Angela Lansbury","running_time":"94 minutes[1]","music_by":"David Newman","edited_by":"Bob Bender Fiona Trayler","Release":"20th Century Fox scheduled for Anastasia to be released on November 21, 1997, notably a week after the 1997 re-release of Disney's The Little Mermaid. Disney claimed it had long-planned for the seventeen-day re-release to coincide with a consumer products campaign leading into Christmas and the film's home video release in March 1998, as well continue the tradition for re-releasing the film within a seven to eight-year interval. In addition to this, Disney would release several competing family films including Flubber on the following weekend, as well as a double feature of George of the Jungle and Hercules.[22] As a response, Disney refused to advertise for the film on the ABC program The Wonderful World of Disney, and banned its corporate sponsors from airing film clips during their television commercials.[23] Commenting on the fierce competition between the two films, Disney spokesman John Dreyer brushed off allegations of studio rivalry claiming \"We always re-release our movies around holiday periods.\" However, Fox executives refused to believe Dreyer's statement with Bill Mechanic responding that \"It's a deliberate attempt to be a bully, to kick sand in our face. They can't be trying to maximize their own business; the amount they're spending on advertising is ridiculous....It's a concentrated effort to keep our film from fulfilling its potential.\"[24]Anastasia was accompanied with a marketing campaign at more than $50 million with promotional sponsors from Burger King, Dole Food Company, Hershey, Chesebrough-Ponds, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Shell Oil, and the 1997 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Overall, the marketing costs exceeded that of Independence Day by more than 35 percent.[25] For merchandising, Fox selected Galoob to license dolls based on Anastasia.[24]On April 28, 1998, Anastasia was released on VHS and sold eight million units.[26] On March 14, 2006, the film was reissued on a two-disc \"Family Fun Edition\" DVD with the film in its original theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen format. The first disc contained the film, an optional audio commentary from directors/writers Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and bonus features. The second disc contained a making-of documentary, music video and making-of featurette of Aaliyah's \"Journey to the Past\", and additional bonus content.[27] The film was released on Blu-ray on March 22, 2011.[28]","written_by":"Susan Gauthier Bruce Graham Bob Tzudiker Noni White Eric Tuchman","budget":"$50 million"}
