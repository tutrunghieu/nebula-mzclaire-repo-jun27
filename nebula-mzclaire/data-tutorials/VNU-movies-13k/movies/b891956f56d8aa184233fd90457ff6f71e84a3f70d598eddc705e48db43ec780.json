What does work in the film, however, is the unlikely relationship between Howell and Ann-Margret... The movie is top-heavy with plot, and what's good in it gets lost in the confusion.Janet Maslin of The New York Times:[3]A Tiger's Tale, which opens today at Loews 84th Street Six, is most notable for what it doesn't have: a heavy hand. The material has more than enough potential to become painfully silly, and Mr. Douglas's biggest accomplishment is making sure that doesn't happen.","box_office":"$89,000[1]","cinematography":"Tony Pierce-Roberts","production_company":"Vincent Pictures","a_tiger's_tale":"Theatrical poster","directed_by":"Peter Douglas","release_dates":"12 February 1988","produced_by":"Don Goldman Peter Douglas","starring":"Ann-Margret C.
