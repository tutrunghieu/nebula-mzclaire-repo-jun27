Carrol Naish's last film. Chaney filmed his part in mid-1969 when the film was titled Blood Seekers. Naish filmed additional footage in 1970 when Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster were added to the story (in his confrontation scene with Dracula, he appears noticeably older).[1] Director Adamson's wife, Regina Carrol, appears in the film as one of the people who discover the two title monsters. The film was released on DVD by Troma Entertainment.[2]Two other films titled Dracula vs Frankenstein were made around the same time as Adamson's film. In 1969, Spanish horror film icon Paul Naschy starred in Los Monstruos del Terror which was later released on VHS as Dracula vs Frankenstein. Meanwhile, in 1971, famed Spanish schlock film director Jesus Franco turned out his Dracula vs Frankenstein, apparently unaware that Al Adamson was already using that title.","produced_by":"Al Adamson Mardi Rustam Mohammed Rustam Samuel M.
