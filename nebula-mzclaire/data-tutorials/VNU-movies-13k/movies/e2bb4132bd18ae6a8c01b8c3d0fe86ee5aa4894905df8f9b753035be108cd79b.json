Maggie takes Cody in, and she becomes the daughter she never had.Six years later, Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric (Rufus Sewell), and abducts Cody (Holliston Coleman). Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy Smits), an expert in ritual murder and occult-related crime, takes up her case when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children.Cody, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply special. She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.","language":"English","Reception":"Bless the Child received almost universally negative reviews from critics, with Rotten Tomatoes giving this film a 3% rating and is ranked #29 on their worst-reviewed films of the last decade.[4]Film critic Bruce Kirkland felt that Bless the Child was mocking Scientology in the guise of the fictional cult \"The New Dawn\".[5]","box_office":"$40,443,010[2]","cinematography":"Peter Menzies Jr.","production_company":"Icon Productions","directed_by":"Chuck Russell","Awards":"The film was nominated for one Razzie Award, Worst Actress for Kim Basinger, along with I Dreamed of Africa, but lost to Madonna for The Next Best Thing.[6]","bless_the_child":"Theatrical release poster","release_dates":"August 11, 2000 (2000-08-11)|||||","Box office":"The film opened at #7 at the North American box office making USD$9.4 million in its opening weekend.
