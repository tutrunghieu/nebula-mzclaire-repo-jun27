{"distributed_by":"Europa Filmes MAM Filmes","Plot":"In the late 1990s, Durval (Ary França) is a middle-aged man who owns a record store in the first floor of his overbearing mother's (Etty Fraser) house. A typical hippie, Durval refuses to sell CDs despite the decline in customers. He notices his mother is not giving as much attention to cooking and house chores as she once did, and suggests they hire a maid, a task which is tricky since they are only willing to pay 100 reais. A young woman (Letícia Sabatella) finally appears willing to take on the job, but disappears after one day. They soon discover that she left a little girl called Kiki and a note asking them to take care of her for a few days. Durval and his mother become attached to Kiki, but soon discover she is actually the daughter of a wealthy family from the countryside who has been kidnapped.","language":"Portuguese","box_office":"R$406,930[2]","cinematography":"Jacob Solitrenick","production_company":"Dezenove Som e Imagens África Filmes","directed_by":"Anna Muylaert","Soundtrack":"Tim Maia's Immunização Racional (Que Beleza) does not appear in the soundtrack album, but is present in the film.The song \"Mestre Jonas\", present in the film's opening sequence, relates to the film's story through its lyrics.
