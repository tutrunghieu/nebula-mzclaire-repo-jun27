The characters and their actions are inscrutable, made even more so by the near-total absence of dialogue. The film's empty, mutable vistas (the exteriors were shot in Scotland) look good but evoke very little.\"[1] Time Out London wrote: \"Taking no account of plausibility, Stelling's exploration of the uses and abuses of power is art house fare, but neither obscure nor elitist. Enthralling performances generate a claustrophobic tension, but there's humour too.\"[2]","cinematography":"Theo van de Sande","directed_by":"Jos Stelling","release_dates":"18 September 1986","produced_by":"Jos Stelling Stanley Hillebrandt","running_time":"96 minutes","the_pointsman":"Theatrical release poster","music_by":"Michel Mulders","edited_by":"Rimko Haanstra"}
