It all starts when Sullivan innocently tosses Josh's basketball-savvy dog, Buddy, a football one day, and he discovers that Buddy also has an uncanny ability to play the sport of football. Soon enough, Buddy begins playing on Josh's Junior High football team. At first, the team is failing miserably since they have been losing a lot of games. But thanks to Buddy's superior football skills, the team keeps on winning and makes the playoffs. In addition, they advance to the championship. Meanwhile, two Russian siblings by the names of Natalya and Popov kidnap Buddy in hopes of having him perform as the special attraction in the Russian circus while Josh runs away when Patrick proposes to his mother. His coach finds him and convinces him that just because Patrick is in his life now, he doesn't have to stop loving his father and he returns home, but Patrick is gone and Buddy is missing. The Timberwolves are forced to play the championship game without Buddy and are losing terribly. Buddy and the other animals manage to escape and Natalya and Popov are arrested and placed into the custody of the Russian embassy after their van falls into a lake following a chase sequence. Meanwhile, Patrick finds Buddy and takes him to the game. With the help of Buddy, the team catches up, but Buddy is tackled and taken out of the game. The Timberwolves are forced to finish the game without him and thanks to Josh and Tommy, and they win the championship. Later, Josh stops Patrick from leaving and convinces him to stay. The family later goes to a Seattle Seahawks football game and Buddy sneaks onto the field.","Rating":"Prior to the film's theatrical release, it was originally rated PG by the MPAA (as seen in the original theatrical trailer).[1] However, by the time the film was released in theaters, it was given a G rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, making it the first Air Bud film to have been designated that rating in the United States.","language":"English","box_office":"$10,224,116","cinematography":"Mike Southon","production_company":"Walt Disney Pictures Dimension Films Keystone Entertainment","directed_by":"Richard Martin","release_dates":"August 14, 1998 (1998-08-14)|||||","produced_by":"Robert Vince","starring":"Tim Conway Dick Martin Kevin Zegers Cynthia Stevenson","running_time":"90 minutes","Home video release":"This film was released to VHS in 1998, and was later released to DVD in 2000.
