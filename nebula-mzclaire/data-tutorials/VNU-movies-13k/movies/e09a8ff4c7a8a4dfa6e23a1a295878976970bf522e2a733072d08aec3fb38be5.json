{"country":"United States","distributed_by":"Live Entertainment Orion Pictures Corporation Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","Plot":"In 1962, Hank Marshall (Tommy Lee Jones) and his wife, Carly (Jessica Lange), are having marital problems because of the pressures of his job and her mental illness. He is a nuclear engineer who favors underground nuclear testing and is at odds with his superiors over the wisdom of above-ground, open-air detonations. She is a free spirit who appears to be mentally unbalanced and who is slowly being suffocated by domestic torpor and encroaching age. Her behavior is, to say the least, embarrassing for him, especially in the confines of a military base. His reactions to this behavior are among the most interesting aspects of the film. Their move from Hawaii to an isolated base in Alabama alarms their oldest daughter, Alex (Amy Locane), and sends Carly into an affair with the base commander, Vince Johnson (Powers Boothe).","language":"English","Reception":"The film received generally positive reviews, with a fresh 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[2] Entertainment Weekly raved about Lange, calling her turn \"a fierce, brave, sexually charged performance, one of the most convincing portrayals I've seen of someone whose behavior flirts with craziness without quite crossing into it,\"[3] while the New York Daily News noted, \"Lange smolders, storms, rages and whimpers through Blue Sky, acting with every muscle in her body.\"[4] Variety also noted, \"Jessica Lange makes the most of an opportunity at a full-blown star turn as Carly Marshall. In fact, Brigitte Bardot and Marilyn Monroe are about the only other actresses one can imagine pulling off such a role as well as Lange has. [She] has the showy role, with almost unlimited opportunities to emote and strut her stuff, which she does magnificently and with total abandon.\"[5] The New York Times noted, \"It is a lavish role for Ms. Lange, and she brings to it fierce emotions and tact. [It] echoes [her] dazzling role in Frances.[6] The Los Angeles Times also praised her performance, calling it \"striking\" and noting, \"Lange's acting in Blue Sky leaves you awestruck. It's a great performance—probably her best.\"[7] The Washington Post noted, \"Lange [offers] a plush, platinum star turn. She is what Carly imagines she might have become if only she hadn't been a military wife: mostly Monroe with a soupcon of Bardot.\"[8] The The New Yorker raved,[9] calling her turn \"a stunning performance—perhaps the best of [her] remarkable career.\"","blue_sky":"Theatrical poster","box_office":"$3,359,465 (USA)","cinematography":"Steve Yaconelli","directed_by":"Tony Richardson","release_dates":"September 16, 1994 (1994-09-16)|||||","produced_by":"Robert H.
