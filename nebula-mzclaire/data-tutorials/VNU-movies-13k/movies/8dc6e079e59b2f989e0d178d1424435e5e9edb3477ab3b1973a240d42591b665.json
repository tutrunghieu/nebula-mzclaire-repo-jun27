{"directed_by":"Terence Ryan","country":"United Kingdom","blind_justice":"Theatrical release poster","Plot":"When the British territory of Southern Rhodesia issues a unilateral declaration of independence in 1965, it means freedom and hope for some; despair, fear, and death for others. The one thing certain is that nobody can escape the changes it will bring - least of all Joseph Mahoney, the last colonial commissioner in Kariba Gorge, who finds himself charged with a vast region thrown into turmoil as UDI becomes reality. With the assistance of Afrikaner naturalist Suzie de Villiers and his loyal Ndebele manservant Sampson, Mahoney finds himself struggling to see justice administered to all despite unsympathetic colonists, tribal intrigues, and a mounting rural insurgency. Meanwhile, Sampson finds himself torn between his commitment to ZAPU nationalists and his friendship with Joseph. After Mahoney settles permanently in Rhodesia on Suzie's farm, ZIPRA orders Sampson to bomb the homestead; the latter is appalled, and only carries out his attack when his employers are away.Captured by the Rhodesian Security Forces, Sampson now stands trial for attempted murder - while Joseph leads an increasingly desperate race against the clock to secure a pardon, win back an estranged Suzie, and try to stop his adopted homeland from being plunged into a fresh wave of bloodletting and vengeance.","produced_by":"Mark Cassidy Christopher Coy Executive: Elizabeth Rowley Patricia Shorten","starring":"Christopher Cazenove Oliver Reed Patrick Shai Edita Brychta","running_time":"90 minutes","language":"English","music_by":"Julian Laxton Fransua Roos Patric van Blerk","edited_by":"David Heitner Max Lemon","written_by":"John Gordon Davis (book) Mark Ezra","cinematography":"Hanro MÃ¶hr"}
