{"directed_by":"Bigas Luna","release_dates":"1996","starring":"Valeria Marini","language":"Italian","Reception":"The film received extremely negative criticism. Film critic Morando Morandini referred to it as \"the most silly, foolish and amateurish film of Bigas Luna\",[3] while Paolo Mereghetti was even tougher, saying he \"never have come out of a movie theater with a much deeper discomfort.\"[4]","Controversy":"Because of the many scenes of sexual abuse, the film was R-rated, something that caused the ire of lead actress Valeria Marini, who asserted that she had been promised the cut of the three more explicit scenes and a ban for just people under 14 years.[1] The actress therefore sued the producer Marco Poccioni demanding the immediate withdrawal of the film, but her request was eventually rejected.[2]","music_by":"Lucio Dalla","External links":"","written_by":"Bigas Luna Cesare Frugoni","cinematography":"Fabio Conversi"}
