The three stories within the story each occur in a setting that is nominally historic, but really in the realm of fantasy: an adventure tale with a Persian setting out of the Arabian Nights, a Renaissance Venetian romance, and a largely comic story set in China.","language":"Silent film German intertitles","cinematography":"Bruno Mondi Erich Nitzschmann Herrmann Saalfrank Bruno Timm Fritz Arno Wagner","directed_by":"Fritz Lang","release_dates":"6 October 1921 (1921-10-06)|||||","produced_by":"Erich Pommer","starring":"Lil Dagover Walter Janssen Bernhard Goetzke Rudolf Klein-Rogge Hans Sternberg Erich Pabst Max Adalbert Georg John","running_time":"105 minutes","External links":"","Release":"In Germany, the film was poorly received at first, with critics complaining that it was not 'German' enough, but the film was much more successful overseas.[1] Douglas Fairbanks purchased the American rights, to delay its general American release while he copied the effects of the Persian segment for his 1924 The Thief of Baghdad.
