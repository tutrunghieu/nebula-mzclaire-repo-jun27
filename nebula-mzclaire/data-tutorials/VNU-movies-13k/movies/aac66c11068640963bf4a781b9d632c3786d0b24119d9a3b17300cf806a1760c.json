Michael's girlfriend helps him attempt to make sense of it all. Anthony Perkins plays a blackmailer, John Candy has a supporting role as 'John'.It is interesting to note that the cast of SCTV play numerous straight roles in the film because George Bloomfield SCTV's director brought them in. Unfortunately the film fell apart as the script was revised daily with one camp writing one version and other another etc. It was also one of Maury Chaykin's first movies.","produced_by":"Jerome S.
