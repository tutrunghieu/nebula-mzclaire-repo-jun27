The critical consensus states, \"Epic in technical scale but breathlessly intimate in narrative scope, Boyhood is a sprawling investigation of the human condition.\"[23] On Metacritic, the film has a perfect score of 100 out of 100, based on 50 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[24] It is the highest rated of all films reviewed upon their original release on the site.[25] It also holds the highest number of reviews for a film with a score of 100. Both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes listed Boyhood as the best-reviewed film of 2014.[26][27]A collection of 25 French critiques on AlloCiné, including those from Le Monde and Cahiers du Cinéma, indicates wide approval, with an average score of 4.0 out of 5.[28] The international film magazine Sight & Sound named it the best film of 2014 after polling an international group of 112 film critics.[29]In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis stated that the film's realism was \"jolting\" and \"so brilliantly realized and understated that it would be easy to overlook.\"[30] A. O. Scott, also writing for The New York Times, called Boyhood the best film of 2014, saying that he could not think of any film that had affected him the way Boyhood had in his 15 years as a professional film critic.[31] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also named Boyhood the best movie of the year, calling it the year's \"biggest emotional powerhouse.\"[32] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \"one of the greatest films of the decade\".[33] Richard Roeper gave the film an A+, calling it one of the greatest films he had ever seen.[34] Wai Chee Dimock, writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, compared Linklater's film with Nobel laureate J. M. Coetzee's memoir, Boyhood: Scenes from Provincial Life.[35]Many critics singled out Patricia Arquette's performance for praise. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle said that watching Arquette was \"like watching a generation's hopes and struggles, presented by an actress with a fullness of emotion, and yet with utter matter-of-factness.\"[36] Michael Phillips, writing for The Chicago Tribune, lauded Arquette's \"lack of pretense or affectation as a performer.\"[37]Boyhood also earned the admiration of other filmmakers and artists. Director Christopher Nolan named Boyhood as his favorite film of 2014, calling it \"extraordinary\".[38] Writer-director Mike Leigh, while accepting a fellowship from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2015, called it \"the definitive independent film.\"[39] Writer Joyce Carol Oates tweeted her support, saying: \"It is rare that a film so mimics the rhythms and texture of actual life as Boyhood. Such seeming spontaneity is a very high art.\"[40] Poet and critic Dan Chiasson wrote in a contribution to The New York Review of Books: \"This is a great film, the greatest American movie I have ever seen in a theater. It is great for what we see, but it is even greater for its way of making real what we cannot see, or for suggesting that what we cannot yet see we might one day see.\"[41] According to Canadian philosopher Howard Adelman, \"[Boyhood] is Huckleberry Finn for the twenty-first century, for it is only Mason Jr. who retains his honesty, integrity and sense of decency throughout ... a masterful movie not to be missed.\"[42] Alejandro González Iñárritu, winner of the Academy Award for Best Director in 2015 and Linklater's fellow nominee, said that when he watched Boyhood, he sent an email to Linklater and thanked him for giving \"this incredible gift\".[43]Other critics reacted less positively to the film. Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan described it as \"at best, OK\" and one whose \"animating idea is more interesting than its actual satisfactions.\"[44] Sam Adams of Indiewire argued that the unanimous praise for Boyhood is bad for film criticism, as it tends to marginalize the analysis of critics who disagree with the majority. Adams argued that masterpieces are made \"by careful scrutiny\" and not \"by unanimous praise.\"[45] Richard Brody of The New Yorker listed the film at the top of a year-end list he called \"The Negative Ten\", a list of films with \"significant merit\", but that also \"occluded the view toward the year's most accomplished and daringly original work.\"[46]Boyhood appeared on more critics' annual \"best-of\" lists in 2014 than any other film, including the most first-place votes.[47][48] According to CriticsTop10.com, it was included on 536 lists and topped 189 of them—with the latter being a record by that site's count.[49]Linklater told Hypable in July 2014 that he was planning a DVD/Blu-ray release through The Criterion Collection:[94]Yeah, we've got a ton of behind the scenes stuff. We made this in the era where everyone has a digital camera so we unearthed an interview from year one with Ellar, Lorelei, Patricia and myself, Patricia interviewed me in 2002. I hadn't seen this since we shot it, Ellar had forgotten quite a bit of it but he got to see himself as a wide-eyed six year old. For people who like the movie, I think there will be a lot of cool little treasures.On August 21, Variety reported that Paramount Home Media Distribution had acquired the U.S. home entertainment rights for DVD, Blu-ray and digital distribution. IFC Films will retain VOD and EST sales as part of the deal.[95] The film became available on Digital HD on December 9, 2014, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 6, 2015.[96]","box_office":"$44.5 million[2]","boyhood":"Theatrical release poster","cinematography":"Lee Daniel|Shane Kelly|","production_company":"IFC Productions Detour Filmproduction","directed_by":"Richard Linklater","Soundtrack":"The original motion picture soundtrack for director Richard Linklater's ambitious, decade-spanning coming of age film Boyhood, like other soundtracks for Linklater films such as Dazed and Confused, Suburbia, and School of Rock, features an eclectic roster of artists running the gamut from classic rock to punk and indie pop. Produced by Linklater and Randall Poster, the 16-track set includes contributions from Arcade Fire (\"Deep Blue\"), The Flaming Lips (\"Do You Realize?\"), Gotye (\"Somebody That I Used to Know,\" featuring Kimbra), Coldplay (\"Yellow\"), and Paul McCartney & Wings (\"Band on the Run\"), as well as an original tune, \"Summer Noon,\" by Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy and his son Spencer.[20]Slate's Jack Hamilton wrote:\"Boyhood's soundtrack has been lauded for its period specificity, the way songs trace the film’s chronology, from the early-aughts sheen of Coldplay’s “Yellow” in its opening frames to Jeff Tweedy’s 2014 “Summer Noon” in its closing credits. And yet the film’s sonic world is more than a rambling, multidecade mixtape; Boyhood’s sound design cleverly tweaks the divide between diegetic and nondiegetic, between music that occurs in the world of the film—a character listening to a live band or popping in a CD—and music that occurs beyond the frame of the camera, the way a conventional score functions.\"[21]","release_dates":"January 19, 2014 (2014-01-19) (Sundance)|July 11, 2014 (2014-07-11) (United States)||||","Production":"In May 2002, Linklater said that he would begin shooting an untitled film in his home city of Houston, Texas that summer.[9] He planned to assemble the cast and crew for a few weeks' filming annually for 12 years. He said: \"I've long wanted to tell the story of a parent–child relationship that follows a boy from the first through the 12th grade and ends with him going off to college. But the dilemma is that kids change so much that it is impossible to cover that much ground. And I am totally ready to adapt the story to whatever he is going through.\"[9] IFC, the film's distributor, committed to a film budget of US$200,000 per year, or $2.4 million over the 12-year shooting period.[10]Linklater hired the six-year-old Coltrane to play the boy.[11][12] The cast could not sign contracts for the film due to the De Havilland Law, which makes it illegal to contract someone for more than seven years of work. Linklater told Hawke that he would have to finish the film if Linklater died.[13][14]Boyhood began filming without a completed script. Linklater had prepared each character's basic plot points, and the ending—including the final shot—but otherwise wrote the script for the next year's filming after rewatching the previous year's footage, incorporating the changes he saw in each actor. All major actors participated in the writing process, contributing their life experiences; for example, Hawke's character is based on his and Linklater's fathers—both Texan insurance agents who divorced and remarried—and Arquette's character is based on her mother, who resumed her education later in life and became a psychotherapist.[14]Despite the unconventional screenwriting process, Linklater stated that he had a general storyline in mind, and that the actors did not change the general direction of the story:People think I asked Ellar, \"What did you do in school the other day? Let's make a scene about that!\" That never happened. The time we spent together was me just gauging where he was at in his life—what his concerns were and what he was doing. Then I would think, maybe we could move the camping trip up, and we can do this or that.[15]Scripts for certain scenes were sometimes finished the night prior to shooting. According to Hawke, the discussion about the possibility of additional Star Wars films is \"the only honest-to-god improvised moment in the movie.\"[14] The cast and crew gathered once or twice each year, on varying dates, to film for three or four days. The production team spent approximately two months in pre-production, and one month in post-production each year.[16] When Arquette became the lead on the TV series Medium, she filmed her scenes over weekends.[14]Hawke said in 2013:It's Tolstoy-esque in scope. I thought Before Sunrise was the most unique thing I would ever be a part of, but Rick has engaged me in something even more strange. Doing a scene with a young boy at the age of seven when he talks about why do raccoons die, and at the age of 12 when he talks about video games, and 17 when he asks me about girls, and have it be the same actor—to watch his voice and body morph—it's a little bit like time-lapse photography of a human being.[17]Although Linklater had referred to the project as Boyhood during the early years of production,[11] in 2013 he settled on the title 12 Years, but was forced to rename it by the release of 12 Years a Slave in the same year.[10] Hawke was amazed that the producers \"still had their job\" at the film's completion, despite \"(having) to hide a couple hundred thousand dollars a year for over a decade while we slowly made this movie.\"[13] Despite the risks, Linklater was allowed an unusual level of freedom with the production, never having to show IFC the work as it progressed.[10]Costume designer Kari Perkins had to review each year's footage to ensure there were no accidental repetitions and to create a \"flow\" to the costumes.[18]When discussing shooting format in an interview, Linklater discussed how insistent he was on shooting 35mm film:\"We very intentionally shot in the same way throughout, just to get a unified look. 35mm negative is about the most stable thing you could shoot on. We kinda had that from the beginning. I remember it not even being a question. You know the HD formats, I didn’t really like them very much at all. I’m just not warming up to them. But they change a lot. The film would have six different looks if we tried to keep up.\"[19]","produced_by":"Richard Linklater|Cathleen Sutherland|Jonathan Sehring|John Sloss|","starring":"Patricia Arquette|Ellar Coltrane|Lorelei Linklater|Ethan Hawke|","running_time":"165 minutes[1]","edited_by":"Sandra Adair","written_by":"Richard Linklater","budget":"$4 million[2]"}
