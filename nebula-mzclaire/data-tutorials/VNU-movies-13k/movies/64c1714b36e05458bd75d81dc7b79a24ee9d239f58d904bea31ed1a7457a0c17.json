Katz","directed_by":"Roger Vadim","release_dates":"March 4, 1988 (1988-03-04)","Production":"Vadim announced his plan to make a new version of And God Created Woman in 1983 along with producers George Braunstein and Ron Hamady. Vadim:Friends suggested that I remake the film. I was curious to see how Juliette (the main character in the 1956 film) would have changed and not changed in 1983. In 1956, Frenchwomen were presenting the image of a new, modern kind of female. Today, the newest prototypes are coming from America. The other reason for remaking 'And God Created Woman' is because the story itself is good. The basic situation involves a young woman whose amoral escapades make her an outsider, the pink wold in the herd. The 1950s, with its restrictive morality, was the perfect time to make the film. In the 1980s we are back in a similar era and will have the girl confronted by the Moral Majority, which is still a good proportion of this country.[2]Vadim announced he and producers would undertake a nationwide talent quest to discover a 19-20 year old to star.[2]RJ Stewart was reported as writing on a script with Diane Lane mentioned as a leading contender for the star role.[3]Vadim selected Rebecca De Mornay to play the lead. \"He wasn't the kind of man I expected to meet,\" recalled the actor. \"I found him very funny and warm. He makes me feel secure and I feel like I can trust him not to turn this into an exploitation film.\"[4]Rebecca De Mornay had seen the original movie when she was younger. She said during filming that:In some ways I'm sorry they're even using the same title. Our story has nothing to do with the first film.It's entirely different. This is an American love story set in New Mexico. But of course it was on the strength of the title that Vadim was able to promote interest in the project.[4]Roger Vadim stated during filming:What is important for me here is once again to tell the story of a sexy, funny and somewhat outrageous young woman within a social context. That's why, even though practically everything about the original has been changed and I don't consider this in any sense a remake, I feel justified in using the title... Santa Fe in the 80s is not Saint Tropez in the 50s, except perhaps in the sense that there is no gap between the classes. Rich people, artists, blue collar and Indian - different parts of the society mix together, which was true of St Tropez before it became the circus it is now. And, more important, in the last 30 years women have won many freedoms - social freedom, professional freedom, sexual freedom. Robin, the girl in the film, claims all these freedoms - in a way that's cerebral, she's aware of her personality, while Bardot behaved totally instinctively.[1]Production took place in New Mexico.","produced_by":"Mitchell Cannold Steven Reuther Ruth Vitale","starring":"Rebecca De Mornay|Vincent Spano|Frank Langella|Donovan Leitch|","running_time":"98 minutes","music_by":"Thomas Chase Steve Rucker","edited_by":"Suzanne Pettit","written_by":"R.
