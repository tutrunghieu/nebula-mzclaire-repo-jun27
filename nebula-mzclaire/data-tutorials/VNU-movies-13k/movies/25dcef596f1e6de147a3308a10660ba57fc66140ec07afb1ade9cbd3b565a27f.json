{"country":"United Kingdom","distributed_by":"Tigon Film Distributors Embassy Pictures","Plot":"An outsider visits a remote isolated village that has seemingly shunned the modern life. Doctor Del Shaw, an investigator from the British ecological watchdog group nicknamed Doomwatch, is sent to the island of Balfe, to file a report on the effects of a recent oil tanker spill. He becomes fascinated with the mysterious behavioural disorders of the locals who display rudeness and random aggression and a strange genetic prevalence of thick lips and sloping brows. Investigation shows that the villagers have been suffering over a prolonged period from hormonal disorders, which are being caused by leaking drums of growth stimulants that have been dumped offshore. The islanders have been eating contaminated fish and develop a disorder of excessive hormonal growth, which produces aggression and eventually madness, attributed to a form of acromegaly. Rather than seek help from the mainland they hide those who are deformed from any newcomers.","language":"English","Synopsis":"The waters surrounding an island become contaminated by chemical dumping, and people who eat fish caught in those waters become deformed and violent.","cinematography":"Kenneth Talbot","production_company":"Tigon British Film Productions","directed_by":"Peter Sasdy","release_dates":"March 1972","produced_by":"Tony Tenser","starring":"Ian Bannen Judy Geeson John Paul Simon Oates Jean Trend Joby Blanshard","running_time":"92 minutes","music_by":"John Scott","edited_by":"Keith Palmer","written_by":"Clive Exton Television series: Gerry Davis Kit Pedler"}
