She can't help breaking the rules by becoming overly involved in the lives of the subscribers. Some of the more peculiar ones include a dentist who composes songs on an air hose, an actor who emulates Marlon Brando, and a little boy for whom she pretends to be Santa Claus.Ella has a secret crush on the voice of subscriber Jeffrey Moss, a playwright for whom she plays a comforting \"Mom\" character. She finally meets him face to face, when she brings him a message under a false name (Melisande Scott) and romantic sparks and some confusion begin.A humorous subplot involves the courtly Otto, who convinces Susanswerphone to take orders for his \"mail-order classical record business\". Unfortunately, Otto is actually a bookie whose orders are a system for betting on horses. Unwittingly, Ella changes some of the \"orders\" not realizing she is changing \"bets\".Although the police begin to assume that Susanswerphone might be a front for an escort service, the plot ends happily, with Jeff proposing, and her wacky subscribers coming to thank her.","language":"English","box_office":"$3,625,000[1][2]","Synopsis":"Based on the successful 1956 Broadway production of the same name by Betty Comden, Adolph Green, and Jule Styne, the film focuses on Ella Peterson, who works in the basement office of Susanswerphone, a telephone answering service.Peterson, based on Mary Printz,[3] who worked at Green's service, listens in on others' lives and adds some interest to her own humdrum existence by adopting different identities for her clients.
