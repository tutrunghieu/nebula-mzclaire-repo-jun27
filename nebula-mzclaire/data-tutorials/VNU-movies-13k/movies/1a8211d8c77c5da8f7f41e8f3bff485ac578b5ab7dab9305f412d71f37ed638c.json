{"country":"Japan","Plot":"Members of a cult, modeled on Aum Shinrikyo, sabotage a city's water supply, then commit mass suicide near the shores of a lake. Family members (the credited cast, minus Asano) of the perpetrators meet at the lake to observe the anniversary of their loved ones' deaths. They meet a former member of the cult (Asano), who had trained for the water sabotage attack but defected at the last minute. He leads them to the cabin he's currently holed up in, where he and the deceased cult members had trained for the attack, and they pass the night reminiscing about those they'd known and lost, shown cinematically through improvised dialogues and flashbacks. Sakata, the aforementioned surviving cult and last to see most of the departed alive, and Atsushi (Arata) interrogate one another about Yûko (played by actress/model Ryo), Atsushi's sister, whom Sakata had asked to run away with him the night before the attack.","language":"Japanese","cinematography":"Yutaka Yamasaki","directed_by":"Hirokazu Koreeda","Awards":"This film was nominated for the Golden Palm award at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.[1]","release_dates":"May 10, 2001 (2001-05-10) (France) May 26, 2001 (2001-05-26)","produced_by":"Masayuki Akieda","starring":"Arata Yusuke Iseya Susumu Terajima Yui Natsukawa","running_time":"132 minutes","External links":"","edited_by":"Hirokazu Koreeda","written_by":"Hirokazu Koreeda"}
