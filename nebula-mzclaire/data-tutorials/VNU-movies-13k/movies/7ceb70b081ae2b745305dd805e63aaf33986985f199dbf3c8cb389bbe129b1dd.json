{"country":"Belgium","distributed_by":"Transatlantic Films Brussels","camping_cosmos":"Screenshot: Miss Vandeputte and Mister Vandeputte, owners of Camping Cosmos.","Plot":"On a campsite at the Belgian coast - where everybody wants to live in complete freedom and forget the obligations of everyday life - Jan Bucquoy, the delegate of the Ministry of Culture, must bring culture nearer to the working class. He presents things like Bertolt Brecht's play, Mother Courage and Her Children or an interview with the famous writer Pierre Mertens, but the vacationers at this caravan park are more interested in low-brow distractions, like soccer, boxing matches or beauty contests, as well as sexual adventures and temporary romances.","language":"French","Reception":"The movie was at the origin of a huge controversy about the policy of Flemish state subsidising of movies not at least because of the presence of main actress Lolo Ferrari.[2]","cinematography":"Michel Baudour","directed_by":"Jan Bucquoy","release_dates":"1996 (1996)|||||","Production":"The production was entirely in the hands of Transatlantic Films and its director Francis De Smet. Because of the refusal of the Flemish Government to raise the capital fund of the equivalent of 200.000 Euro at that time, the film had a substantial delay and was not ready in time for the Cannes Film Festival of 1996. This had consequences for the release later in Belgium. The film could not be released before 1997 in Paris.","produced_by":"Francis De Smet","starring":"Lolo Ferrari Noël Godin Arno Hintjens Jan Decleir Herman Brusselmans","running_time":"88 minutes","music_by":"Serge Gainsbourg Vera Lynn George Gershwin","edited_by":"Matyas Veress","written_by":"Jan Bucquoy"}
