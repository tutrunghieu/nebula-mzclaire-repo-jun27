Family Entertainment","screenplay_by":"Caroline Thompson","Plot":"Black Beauty (voiced by Alan Cumming; played by Docs Keepin Time) narrates his own story. He is born on a farm in the English countryside and remains by his mother's side until he is sent to Birtwick Park to serve Squire Gordon and his family.Lady Gordon, the squire's ill wife, is pleased by the beautiful horse and gives him his trademark name, Black Beauty. Beauty is smitten with the squire's bitter chestnut mare, Ginger, who being rather feisty rebuffs his attempts to be friendly. However, Beauty also befriends Merrylegs, a perky white pony who gives rides to the squire's young daughters, Jessica and Molly.On a stormy night, Beauty is pulling a carriage holding the squire and his caretaker, John Manly, home from town, but sensing danger refuses to cross a partially flooded bridge. When John tries to pull him to move, Beauty steadfastly refuses. When the bridge finally gives way, crushing into the river, John slips and falls in, but manages to hang on to Beauty's bridle. Beauty and the squire save John, and after John thanks Beauty with a grateful hug, they again head off back home.Young Joe Green, who works in the stable, volunteers to look after Beauty that night, since John is still rather shaken from the accident. Though well intentioned,Joe's lack of knowledge about horses causes him to give Beauty ice cold water to drink and to neglect to dry him off or cover him with a rug for overnight, which causes Beauty to fall ill. The following few days John, Joe, and the squire treat and nurse Beauty, fearful for his recovery. They're pleased when a few days later he thankfully recovers.Lady Gordon's illness gets worse, and she is taken to a doctor in a carriage pulled by now great pals Beauty and Ginger. When they stop at an inn for the night, the barn where the horses are being kept catches on fire due to a carelessly dropped pipe. Being tied up they're unable to escape the fire themselves, and after much fearful commotion, just as they're close to being consumed by the flames, thankfully they're both bravely rescued by Joe.Lady Gordon's doctor orders her to leave England for a warmer place because her illness is so advanced. The squire and his family bid a sad goodbye to John, Joe, and the beloved horses. Whilst pony Merrylegs is given to the the vicar as a gift, but who promises never to sell him.Beauty and Ginger are taken to Earlshall Park, home of the Lord and Lady of Wexmire, and Joe bids a tearful goodbye to Beauty. Beauty and Ginger are paired up to pull Lady Wexmire's carriage, but she demands that the horses wear uncomfortable bearing reins to raise their heads high, as that is the aristocratic fashion, which angers both but incenses Ginger, who reverts to her untamed tantrums. When the next day Lady Wexmire orders the horse's heads be strapped up even further, Ginger breaks away from the carriage in a rage, leaving her distressed and causing a deep gash on one of Beauty's hind legs.Reuben Smith, the horses' new caretaker, rides to town with Beauty to take a carriage to be repainted. That evening, he rolls out the tavern boisterously over-drunk, can hardly mount Beauty, and ignores a passing squire's warning that one of the horse's shoes needs replacing. He nevertheless rough rides Beauty home, thoroughly overextending him. Only stopping when Beauty, close to collapse, throws that loose shoe and stumbles to the ground, throwing Reuben off and suffering disfiguring injuries to his knees, which have been rubbed raw. Reuben is dismissed from his job, and Beauty is later sold by Lord Wexmire.He is bought by a man who keeps horses for renting, treats them terribly, and rents out indiscriminately. He works there another few years. When in poor condition from being overworked, Beauty is eventually taken to a fair, where he briefly spots Joe, now a grown-up, but amongst the masses Joe doesn't notice him. Beauty's whinnies instead catch the attention of Jerry Barker, a kindly looking taxi carriage driver from London, who's immediately taken by Beauty and buys him once successfully haggling the cost down to 17 guineas.Jerry introduces Beauty to his warm family - wife and two young children, who name him Black Jack. Though Beauty dislikes the harshness of London, he nevertheless likes his job as a taxi cab horse and Jerry's kindly treatment of him, something he'd not had for many a year now. One day, Beauty is elated to spot Ginger, now a cab horse too - but weak form years of past abuse, she hardly recognises him. Beauty begs for her not to give up, but too soon she's lead away by her owner on a fare. Some time later, Beauty is shocked by an approaching wagon; he's immediately crestfallen as he can sense that atop it lies the body of his poor friend Ginger - now dead. It seems she had finally succumbed.One snowy night, Jerry has a dreadful cough that worsens as he's kept waiting for hours outdoors in the freezing weather for his passengers to leave a party. His condition then worsens, and a doctor advises him to quit his job and move to the countryside if he wishes to survive. Beauty is reluctantly sold once again, this time to a grain dealer whom Jerry believed would treat him kindly. However, they do not, and he's forced to pull heavy loads of flour, day after day, for two never-ending years - until he collapses from utter exhaustion.He is taken to a fair to be sold, but he is now so weak and in poor condition that no one wants to buy him. Then Farmer Thoroughgood and his grandson spot Beauty, and a young man sees him, too. Beauty realizes that the young man is Joe, and though he's hardly able to, he finds the strength and whinnies for his old friend. Joe, recognising the sound, walks over; at first uncertain he's amazed when the signature white dot on his forehead (having previously been covered over by his mane) confirms it is indeed his Beauty. The two are finally reunited.Beauty lives the remainder of his life at Thoroughgood's farm with Joe, who promises that he will never sell Beauty again.","language":"English","box_office":"$4,630,377","cinematography":"Alex Thomson","directed_by":"Caroline Thompson","black_beauty":"Theatrical release poster","Soundtrack":"The film's score was written by Danny Elfman and was released on CD and cassette tape through Warner Bros.'
