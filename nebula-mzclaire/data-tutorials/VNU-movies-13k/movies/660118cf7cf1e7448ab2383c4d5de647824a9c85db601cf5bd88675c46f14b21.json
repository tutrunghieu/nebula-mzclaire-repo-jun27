The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nick the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a deer which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of it.During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox which tells him, \"chaos reigns.\"In the dark attic the man finds the woman’s thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear.Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nick’s shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles. He loses consciousness, and she drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole at the base of the dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.Night falls; now remorseful, she unburies him but cannot remember where the wrench is. She helps him back to the cabin, where she tells him she does \"not yet\" want to kill him, adding that \"when the three beggars arrive someone must die.\" In a possible flashback or sign of guilt, she watches Nick climbing up to the window, but does not act. In the cabin she cuts off her clitoris with scissors. They are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. A hailstorm begins; earlier it had been revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. Finding the wrench under the floorboards, he is stabbed by her with the scissors, but is able to unbolt the grindstone. Finally free, he shows a vicious face, and strangles her to death. He burns her on a funeral pyre.He limps from the cabin, eating wild berries, as the three diaphanous beggars look on. Reaching the top of a hill, under a brilliant light he sees hundreds of women in antiquated clothes coming towards him, their faces blurred.","language":"English","Reception":"In Denmark, the film quickly became successful with both critics and audiences.[39][40] Politiken called it \"a grotesque masterpiece,\" giving it a perfect score of 6 out of 6, and praised it for being completely unconventional while at the same time being \"a profoundly serious, very personal ... piece of art about small things like sorrow, death, sex and the meaninglessness of everything.\"[41] Berlingske Tidende gave it a rating of 4 out of 6 and praised the \"peerless imagery,\" and how \"cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle effectively switches between Dogme-like hand-held scenes and wonderful stylized tableaux.\"[42] An exception was Claus Christensen, editor of the Danish film magazine Ekko. Christensen accused the other Danish critics of overrating the film, himself calling it \"a master director's failed work.\"[43] Around 83,000 tickets were sold in Denmark during the theatrical run, the best performance by a Lars Trier film since Dogville.[44] The film was nominated by Denmark for The Nordic Council Film Prize, which it won.[45] Antichrist went on to sweep the Robert Awards, Denmark's main national film awards, by winning in seven categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematographer, Best Editing, Best Lighting Design and Best Special Effects.[46]However, Antichrist polarized critical opinion in the United States. As of 12 August 2012[update], the film had a 49% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10.[47] (Its summary: \"Gruesome, explicit and highly controversial; Lars von Trier's arthouse-horror, though beautifully shot, is no easy ride.\") Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying:\"Von Trier, who has always been a provocateur, is driven to confront and shake his audience more than any other serious filmmaker. He will do this with sex, pain, boredom, theology and bizarre stylistic experiments. And why not? We are at least convinced we're watching a film precisely as he intended it, and not after a watering down by a fearful studio executive. That said, I know what's in it for Von Trier. What was in it for me? More than anything else, I responded to the performances. Feature films may be fiction, but they are certainly documentaries showing actors in front of a camera.\"[48]In a blog post, he expanded on this, discussing the film's symbolism, imagery and Trier's intentions, calling him \"one of the most heroic directors in the world\" and Antichrist \"a powerfully-made film that contains material many audiences will find repulsive or unbearable. The performances by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are heroic and fearless. Trier's visual command is striking. The use of music is evocative; no score, but operatic and liturgical arias. And if you can think beyond what he shows to what he implies, its depth are [sic] frightening.\"[49] Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called Antichrist \"Trier's most visually lush and technically rigorous film; it captures things at a molecular level and in a slow motion that all but brings the world to a halt... But paradoxically, this is his most unwatchable film, and many will find its violence and cruelty, including scenes of genital mutilation, repellent. I cannot recommend Antichrist, but in a culture that hemorrhages death and torture nightly on shows like 24 or C.S.I., I can understand it.\"[50]Chris Tookey for the British tabloid Daily Mail started his review by noting that the film contains \"a few images of startling beauty,\" but soon went on to call it \"offensively misogynistic\" and \"needlessly graphic.\" He also listed other films that preceded Antichrist in showing explicit sex, genital self-mutilation and \"women torturing men for pleasure,\" eventually giving the film one star out of five.[51] In the British film magazine Empire, film critic Kim Newman gave the film four stars out of five and noted that \"Trier's self-conscious arrogance is calculated to split audiences into extremist factions, but Antichrist delivers enough beauty, terror and wonder to qualify as the strangest and most original horror movie of the year.\"[52]In Australia's The Monthly, film critic Luke Davies viewed the film as \"a bleak but entrancing film that explores guilt, grief and many things besides ... that will anger as many people as it pleases\", describing Trier's \"command of the visually surreal\" as \"truly exceptional\". Davies described the film as \"very good and very flawed\", conceding \"it is not easy to understand the meaning or intention of specific images and details of the film\" but still concludes that \"there’s something neurotic and reactionary in the controversy and near-hysteria surrounding the film.\"[53]Film director John Waters hailed Antichrist as one of the ten best films of 2009 in Artforum, stating \"If Ingmar Bergman had committed suicide, gone to hell, and come back to earth to direct an exploitation/art film for drive-ins, [Antichrist] is the movie he would have made.\"[54]The film won the award for Best Cinematographer at the 2009 European Film Awards, shared with Slumdog Millionaire as both films were shot by Anthony Dod Mantle. It was nominated for Best Director and Best Actress but the awards lost to Michael Haneke for The White Ribbon and Kate Winslet for The Reader respectively.[55]Festivals","box_office":"$791,867[4]","antichrist":"Theatrical release poster","cinematography":"Anthony Dod Mantle","production_company":"Zentropa Entertainments arte France Cinéma Canal+ Danmarks Radio Film i Väst Svenska Filminstitutet Sveriges Television","directed_by":"Lars von Trier","Versions of the film":"According to a correspondence between an Amazon.com Customer Reviewer and Karen Mesoznik, staff member at The Criterion Collection, the version released by Criterion Collection on Blu-ray and DVD is in fact the uncut, so-called \"Protestant Version\" which has a run time of 108 minutes. The cut, so-called \"Catholic Version\", has a run time of between 100 and 104 minutes (approximately).

Trier thought it was a good idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because \"the genre [is such] that you can put a lot of very, very strange images in a horror film\". He had recently seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as Ring and Dark Water, from which he drew inspiration.[12] Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: \"At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell.\"[10] In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether Antichrist really could be classified as a horror film, because \"it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [the horror genre] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it.\"[12]The title was the first thing that was written for the film.[13] Antichrist was originally scheduled for production in 2005, but its executive producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen accidentally revealed the film's planned revelation: that earth was created by Satan and not by God. Trier was furious and decided to delay the shoot so he could rewrite the script.[14]In 2007 Trier announced that he was suffering from depression, and that it was possible that he never would be able to make another film. \"I assume that Antichrist will be my next film. But right now I don't know,\" he told the Danish newspaper Politiken.[15] During an early casting attempt, English actors who had come to Copenhagen had to be sent home, while Trier was crying because his poor condition did not allow him to meet them.[16]The post-depression version of the script was to some extent written as an exercise for Trier, to see if he had recovered enough to be able to work again. Trier has also made references to August Strindberg and his Inferno Crisis in the 1890s, comparing it to his own writing under difficult mental circumstances: \"was Antichrist my Inferno Crisis?\"[13] Several notable names appear in the credits as having assisted Trier in the writing. Danish writer and directors Per Fly and Nikolaj Arcel are listed as script consultants, and Anders Thomas Jensen as story supervisor. Also credited are researchers dedicated to fields including \"misogyny\", \"anxiety\", \"horror films\" and \"theology.\"[17] Trier himself is a Catholic convert and intensely interested in Christian symbolism and theology.[18]Production was led by Trier's Copenhagen-based company Zentropa. Co-producers were Sweden's Film i Väst, Italy's Lucky Red and France's Liberator Productions, Slot Machine and Arte France. The Danish Film Institute contributed with a financial support of $1.5 million and Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Germany with $1.3 million. The total budget was around $11 million.[3]Props for the more violent scenes were provided by the company Soda ApS, and made in their workshop in Nørrebro, Copenhagen. Plaster casts were made of Willem Dafoe's leg and the female \"porno double's\" sexual organ. A plastic baby with authentic weight was made for the opening sequence. Pictures found using Google Image Search had to serve as models for the stillborn deer, and a nylon stocking was used as caul. The vulva prop was constructed with its inner parts detachable for easy preparation if several takes would be needed.[19] Czech animal trainer Ota Bares, who had collaborated with parts of the crew in the 2005 film Adam's Apples, was hired early on and given instructions about what tasks the animals must be able to perform. The fox, for example, was taught to open its mouth on a given command to simulate speaking movements.[20]To get into the right mood before filming started, both Dafoe and Gainsbourg were shown Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror from 1975. Dafoe was also shown Trier's own 1998 film The Idiots, and Gainsbourg The Night Porter to study Charlotte Rampling's character.[21] Dafoe also met therapists working with cognitive behavioral therapy as well as being present at actual sessions of exposure therapy and studying material on the topic.[9] Trier himself is highly skeptical of psychotherapy.[18]Filming took 40 days to finish, from 20 August to the end of September 2008. The film was shot in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Locations were used in Rhein-Sieg-Kreis, part of the Cologne region, and Wuppertal. It was the first film by Trier to be entirely filmed in Germany.[22] The fictional setting of the film however is near Seattle, USA. The film was shot on digital video, primarily using Red One cameras in 4K resolution. The slow motion sequences were shot with a Phantom V4 in 1,000 frames per second. Filming techniques involved dollys, hand-held camerawork and computer-programmed \"motion control\", of which the team had previous experience from Trier's 2006 film The Boss of It All. One shot, where the couple is copulating under a tree, was particularly difficult since the camera would switch from being hand-held to motion controlled in the middle of the take.[20]Trier had not recovered completely from his depression when filming started. He repeatedly excused himself to the actors for being in the mental condition he was, and was not able to operate the camera as he usually does, which made him very frustrated.[16][21] \"The script was filmed and finished without much enthusiasm, made as it was using about half of my physical and intellectual capacity,\" the director said in an interview.[13]Post-production was primarily located in Warsaw, Poland, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Over the time of two months, the Poles contributed with about 4,000 hours of work and the Swedes 500.[20] The film features 80 shots with computer-generated imagery, provided by the Polish company Platige Image. Most of these shots consist of digitally removed details such as the collar and leash used to lead the deer, but some were more complicated. The scene where the fox utters the words \"chaos reigns\" was particularly difficult to make. The mouth movements had to be entirely computer-generated in order to synchronise with the sound.[23] The scene in Chapter Three during which the couple makes love and numerous hands emerge from the roots of a tree was subsequently adapted into the principal promotional art for the film.The aria \"Lascia ch'io pianga\" from Handel's opera Rinaldo is used as the film's main musical theme.[24] The aria has previously been used in other films such as Farinelli, a 1994 biographical film about the castrato singer Farinelli,[25] and was used again by von Trier in Nymphomaniac during a scene referencing the sequence showing Nick approaching the open window.[26] The eight-track soundtrack features both versions of \"Lascia ch'io pianga\" and selected extracts of the \"score\" created by sound designer Kristian Eidnes Andersen.","produced_by":"Meta Louise Foldager","starring":"Willem Dafoe Charlotte Gainsbourg","running_time":"108 minutes[1]","music_by":"Kristian Eidnes Andersen","edited_by":"Anders Refn Åsa Mossberg","Release":"The film premiered during the Competition portion of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival to a polarized response from the audience.[27][28] The film prompted several walk outs and at least four people fainted during the preview due to the film's explicit violence.[29] At the press conference following the screening, Trier was asked by a journalist from the Daily Mail to justify why he made the film, to which the director responded that he found the question strange since he considered the audience as his guests, \"not the other way around.\" He then claimed to be the best director in the world.[30] Charlotte Gainsbourg won the Cannes Film Festival's award for Best Actress.[27] The ecumenical jury at the Cannes festival gave the film a special \"anti-award\" and declared the film to be \"the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world\".[29][31][32] Cannes festival director Thierry Frémaux responded that this was a \"ridiculous decision that borders on a call for censorship\" and that it was \"scandalous coming from an 'ecumenical' jury\".[32] The \"talking fox\" was nominated for the Palm Dog, but lost to Dug from Up.[33]Two versions were available for buyers at the Cannes film market, nicknamed the \"Catholic\" and \"Protestant\" versions, where the former had some of the most explicit scenes removed while the latter was uncut. The uncut version was released theatrically to a general audience on 20 May 2009 in Denmark. It was acquired for British distribution by Artificial Eye and American by IFC Films.[34]In both Ireland and the United Kingdom, Antichrist was released uncut with an 18 certificate.[35] The British Advertising Standards Authority received seven complaints about the film poster, which was based on the original poster and shows the couple as they are having sexual intercourse. The organization decided to approve the poster, finding it to not be pornographic since its \"dark tone\" made it \"unlikely to cause sexual excitement\". An alternative poster, featuring only quotes from reviews and no image at all, was used in outdoor venues and as an alternative for publishers who desired it.[36]The film received a limited theatrical run in Australia followed by a basic DVD release in early 2010. Sale of the DVD was strictly limited in South Australia due to new laws that place restrictions on films with an R18+ classification.[37] A notable feature of the Australian release was the creation of a critically acclaimed poster that made prominent use of a pair of rusty scissors that had the actor's faces fused into the handles. The poster received much international coverage at the end of 2009 and was used as the local DVD cover.This film was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of The Criterion Collection on 9 November 2010.The film was not submitted to the MPAA because the filmmakers feared that it would receive an NC-17 rating for its graphic violence.","Cancelled video game":"According to a June 2009 article in the Danish newspaper Politiken, a video game called Eden, based on the film, was in the works. It was to start where the film ended. \"It will be a self-therapeutic journey into your own darkest fears, and will break the boundaries of what you can and can't do in video games,\" said video game director Morten Iversen.[56] As of 2011[update], Zentropa Games are out of business and Eden has been cancelled.[57]","written_by":"Lars von Trier","budget":"$11 million[3]"}
