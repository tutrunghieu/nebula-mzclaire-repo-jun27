Jasmine takes a taxi to her sister Ginger's (Sally Hawkins) apartment, where Ginger is dismayed to learn that Jasmine traveled first class despite claiming to be broke.Jasmine reflects often on the life that she has lost and yet tries to start a new one, but she is constantly sabotaged by her disdain for her sister's social world. In flashbacks, she remembers her past life in New York with her husband Hal (Alec Baldwin), a wealthy businessman.Some years previously, Ginger and her working-class husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) visited New York, their first time there in many years. Jasmine provides a car and driver for them to tour the city and pays for a stay in a hotel to avoid spending any time with them. Ginger announces they have won US$200,000 in the lottery that Augie intends to use to start a construction business, but Jasmine offers Hal's help in investing the money instead. While touring New York, Ginger sees Hal kiss another woman. The woman later appears at Jasmine's birthday party. Ginger debates whether to say anything to Jasmine but decides to stay quiet, hoping to spare her sister's marriage.After Hal is reported to the authorities as a major fraudster who has lost a lot of money raised from many investors, including Ginger and Augie, Ginger defends Jasmine, but Augie blames her for ruining his life. Hal commits suicide after being sent to prison for fraud. Ginger divorces Augie and begins dating a mechanic called Chili (Bobby Cannavale). Jasmine, meanwhile, suffers a nervous breakdown and is briefly hospitalized before coming to San Francisco. As a result, she has acquired a habit of talking to herself out loud, often reminiscing of more glamorous times.Jasmine considers becoming an interior designer.

This is jaw-dropping work, what we go to the movies hoping to see, and we do. Every few years.\"[15] Andrew Dice Clay's performance was also critically praised in the film.[16]Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 91%, with an average rating of 8 out of 10, based on 196 reviews. The film is considered a \"Certified Fresh\", with the site's consensus being \"Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine finds the director in peak late-period form—and benefiting from a superb cast led by Cate Blanchett.\"[17] On Metacritic, the film received a score of 78/100 based on 47 reviews.[18]Critics have stated that they believe the film is Allen's take, tribute or version of the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire as it shares a very similar plot and characters.[4][5] It also features cast members who have previously been associated with the play: Baldwin played the role of Stanley Kowalski on stage in 1992 and in the 1995 adaptation of the play, while Blanchett played the leading role of Blanche DuBois in the Australian production of the play staged by the Sydney Theatre Company in 2008.[19] Other critics and cultural commentators argued that the story of Jasmine as a \"shrill narcissist falling apart\" and \"in a crisis of self-flagellation after living in denial for years\" was modeled on his former companion, Mia Farrow, and that the film is a \"response\" to their high-profile and acrimonious break-up.[20][21]","box_office":"US$97.5 million[3]","cinematography":"Javier Aguirresarobe","directed_by":"Woody Allen","Home media":"Blue Jasmine was released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 21, 2014.","blue_jasmine":"Theatrical release poster","production_companies":"Gravier Productions Perdido Productions","release_dates":"July 26, 2013 (2013-07-26) (New York City premiere)|August 23, 2013 (2013-08-23) (United States)||||","Production":"In late March 2012, it was announced that Cate Blanchett was being considered for the lead role.[6] This was later confirmed along with the rest of the principal cast in June 2012.[7] In preparation for her role, Blanchett explained, \"I did a lot of people watching. I drank my fair share of rosé. In the end I had to play the anti-heroine that Woody's written, but of course I thought about the Madoff scandal, because that's the holocaust of the financial crisis. And there are many, many women like that.
