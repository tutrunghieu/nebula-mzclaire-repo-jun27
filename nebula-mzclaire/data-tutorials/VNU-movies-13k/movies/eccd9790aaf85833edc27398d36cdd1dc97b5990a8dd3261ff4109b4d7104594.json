{"country":"Germany","Plot":"Ace Reporter Don Stevens (Christopher Walken) is an American journalist who goes to Beirut, Lebanon during the civil war. He stays in a hotel with English journalist Mike Jessop. He is promised an interview with a top PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Palestinian Yassin Abu-Riadd (Amos Lavi). However, this proves to be a set-up and he is duped into interviewing an imposter who claims the PLO are prepared to negotiate peacefully. Outraged by this deception, Stevens becomes determined to find out the truth. In this quest he is helped by a Scandinavian doctor, Linda, who it emerges is Yassin's estranged girlfriend. Along the way, Stevens is hindered by everyone around him: The PLO threaten him, the Phalangists arrest him and the Israelis ignore him. Tricked and beaten, he gradually uncovers a murder plot, double agents, the bombing of the Phalangists headquarters and, most terrifying of all, a plan to massacre hundreds of civilians. In a story that takes the lid off events in Lebanon, Don Stevens becomes a reluctant hero, and in doing so, gets the scoop of a lifetime.","language":"English","box_office":"$141,211 (USA)","cinematography":"Thomas Mauch|Amnon Salomon|","directed_by":"Nathaniel Gutman","See also":"Sabra and Shatila massacre","release_dates":"1987Â (1987)|||||","produced_by":"Elisabeth Wolters-Alfs","starring":"Christopher Walken|Hywel Bennett|Marita Marschall|","running_time":"100 minutes","deadline":"Theatrical release poster","music_by":"Hans Jansen|Jacques Zwart|","edited_by":"Peter Przygodda","written_by":"Hanan Peled"}
