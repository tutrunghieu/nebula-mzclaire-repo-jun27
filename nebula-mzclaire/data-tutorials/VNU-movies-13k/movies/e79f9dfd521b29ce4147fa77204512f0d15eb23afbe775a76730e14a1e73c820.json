They praised the colours and contrasts of the landscape, which they said recalled the work of American painter Maxfield Parrish, and the visual style, which they compared to films by Mario Bava and Tsui Hark. They also noted that Gans had successfully differentiated the film from the source material and prior adaptations, while keeping the \"spirit\" of the original story.[13] Laurent Pecha of EcranLarge remarked that while the film was \"far from perfect\", it was \"so ambitious\" compared to the \"doldrums\" of French cinema that Gans won her over. She called the introduction \"spectacular\" and praised Gans for his willingness to make the audience believe the \"incredible and improbable love story\", praising the \"excellent\" Seydoux and Cassel.[14] Writing for TF1, Olivier Corriez gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and remarked that it was not easy to offer a modern interpretation of Beauty and the Beast as it had been adapted so many times before, but found Gans' film \"flamboyant\" but \"accessible to all audiences\". He said that it \"plays wonderfully on contrasts\" and praised Seydoux for her \"charm and tenderness\" and Cassel for providing \"brutality [and] weakness.\"[15]International reviews were more mixed. Jessica Kiang of Indiewire thought the film was \"immensely, crushingly boring\" and Seydoux wasted in a role that required her to do little more than \"heave her breasts and fall over things prettily.\"[16]","box_office":"US$49.1 million (international)","cinematography":"Christophe Beaucarne","production_company":"Eskwad Pathé Studio Babelsberg","directed_by":"Christophe Gans","release_dates":"12 February 2014 (2014-02-12) (France)|14 February 2014 (2014-02-14) (Berlin)||||","Production":"Principal photography took place in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, from November 2012 to February 2013, on a production budget of €35 million.[9]","Box office":"The film earned a total of US$49.1 million internationally.[10] In Japan, the film topped the box office on its release, making it the first non-English-language foreign film to top the Japanese box office since Red Cliff II in 2009, and the first French film to top the Japanese box office since Mathieu Kassovitz's The Crimson Rivers in 2001.[11]","produced_by":"Richard Grandpierre","starring":"Vincent Cassel Léa Seydoux André Dussollier","running_time":"112 minutes[1]","music_by":"Pierre Adenot","edited_by":"Sébastien Prangère","written_by":"Christophe Gans Sandra Vo-Anh","budget":"€35 million[2]"}
