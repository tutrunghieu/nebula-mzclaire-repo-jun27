{"based_on":"Beauty and the Beast  by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont","Adaptations":"According to an article in The Houston Chronicle, \"The catalyst for Disney's braving the stage was an article by The New York Times theater critic Frank Rich that praised Beauty and the Beast as 1991's best musical.... Theatre Under The Stars executive director Frank Young had been trying to get Disney interested in a stage version of Beauty about the same time Eisner and Katzenberg were mulling over Rich's column. But Young couldn't seem to get in touch with the right person in the Disney empire. Nothing happened till the Disney execs started to pursue the project from their end.... When they asked George Ives, the head of Actors Equity on the West Coast, which Los Angeles theater would be the best venue for launching a new musical, Ives said the best theater for that purpose would be TUTS. Not long after that, Disney's Don Frantz and Bettina Buckley contacted Young, and the partnership was under way.\"[101] A stage condensation of the film, directed by Robert Jess Roth and choreographed by Matt West, both of whom moved on to the Broadway development, had already been presented at Disneyland at what was then called the Videopolis stage.[101] Beauty and the Beast premiered in a joint production of Theatre Under The Stars and Disney Theatricals at the Music Hall, Houston, Texas, from November 28, 1993, through December 26, 1993.[101]On Monday, April 18, 1994, Beauty and the Beast premiered on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in New York City to mixed reviews.[102][103] The show transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 11, 1999.[104] The commercial (though not critical) success of the show led to productions in the West End, Toronto, and all over the world.[104] The Broadway version, which ran for over a decade, received a Tony Award, and became the first of a whole line of Disney stage productions.[105] The original Broadway cast included Terrence Mann as the Beast, Susan Egan as Belle, Burke Moses as Gaston, Gary Beach as Lumière, Heath Lamberts as Cogsworth, Tom Bosley as Maurice, Beth Fowler as Mrs. Potts, and Stacey Logan as Babette the feather duster.[104] Many well-known actors and singers also starred in the Broadway production during its thirteen-year run including Kerry Butler, Debbie Gibson, Toni Braxton, Andrea McArdle, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Christy Carlson Romano, Ashley Brown, and Anneliese van der Pol as Belle; Chuck Wagner, James Barbour, and Jeff McCarthy as the Beast; Meshach Taylor, Patrick Page, Bryan Batt, Jacob Young, and John Tartaglia as Lumière; and Marc Kudisch, Christopher Sieber, and Donny Osmond as Gaston.[104] The show ended its Broadway run on July 29, 2007 after 46 previews and 5,461 performances.[104] As of 2016, it is still Broadway's ninth longest-running show in history.[104]In June 2014, it was announced that a live-action film adaptation of the original film was in the works with Academy Award-winning filmmaker Bill Condon (Chicago, Dreamgirls, Gods and Monsters) directing and Evan Spiliotopoulos writing the script.[106][107] Condon originally planned on not only drawing inspiration from the original film, but he also planned to include most, if not all, of the Menken/Rice songs from the Broadway musical, with the intention of making the film as a \"straight-forward, live-action, large-budget movie musical\".[108] In September 2014, it was announced that Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) will re-write the script.[109] In January 2015, Emma Watson announced on her Facebook page that she will portray Belle in the new live action remake film.[110] In March 2015, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Emma Thompson, Josh Gad, Audra McDonald, and Kevin Kline joined the film as the Beast, Gaston, Mrs. Potts, LeFou, Garderobe, and Maurice, respectively.[111][112][113][114] The following month Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw joined the cast as Cogsworth, Lumière, Cadenza, and Plumette, respectively.[115][116][117][118] Composer Alan Menken will return to score the film's music, with new material written by Menken and Tim Rice.[119] In June 2015, Menken said the film will not include the songs that were written for the Broadway musical.[120] Filming began on May 18, 2015 in London and production officially wrapped in August 2015.[121][122] The film is scheduled to be released on March 17, 2017.[123]","country":"United States","distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","story_by":"Roger Allers|Brenda Chapman|Chris Sanders|Burny Mattinson|Kevin Harkey|Brian Pimental|Bruce Woodside|Joe Ranft|Tom Ellery|Kelly Asbury|Robert Lence|","language":"English","box_office":"$425 million[2]","production_company":"Walt Disney Pictures Walt Disney Feature Animation","directed_by":"Gary Trousdale Kirk Wise","narrated_by":"David Ogden Stiers","release_dates":"November 13, 1991 (1991-11-13) (world premiere)|November 22, 1991 (1991-11-22) (United States)||||","Production":"After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, Walt Disney sought out other stories to adapt into feature films, with Beauty and the Beast being among the stories he considered.[9][26] Attempts to develop the Beauty and the Beast story into a film were made in the 1930s and 1950s, but were ultimately given up because it \"proved to be a challenge\" for the story team.[9] Peter M. Nichols states Disney may later have been discouraged by Jean Cocteau having already done his version.[27]Decades later, during the production of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct, but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th century France.[28] At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.[29]Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989, Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch. A few months after starting anew, Purdum resigned as director. The studio had approached Ron Clements and John Musker to direct the film but turned down the offer saying they were \"tired\" after just having finished directing Disney's recent success The Little Mermaid. Disney then hired first-time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale. Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of Cranium Command, a short film for a Disney EPCOT theme park attraction. In addition, Katzenberg asked songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had written the song score for The Little Mermaid to turn Beauty and the Beast into a Broadway-style musical film in the same vein as Mermaid. Ashman, who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS, had been working with Disney on a pet project of his, Aladdin, and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team. To accommodate Ashman's failing health, pre-production of Beauty and the Beast was moved from London to the Residence Inn in Fishkill, New York, close to Ashman's New York City home.[28] Here, Ashman and Menken joined Wise, Trousdale, Hahn, and Woolverton in retooling the film's script.[9][29] Since the original story had only two major characters, the filmmakers enhanced them, added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who \"add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story\" and guide the audience through the film, and added a \"real villain\" in the form of Gaston.[9]These ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston[30] as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast's castle.[31] The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again.[9][29] The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.[9]Disney had originally considered casting Jodi Benson from The Little Mermaid as Belle.[32] They eventually decided upon Broadway actress and singer Paige O'Hara in favor of having a heroine who sound \"more like a woman than a girl\".[33] According to co-director Kirk Wise, O'Hara was given the role because she \"had a unique quality, a tone she would hit that made her special\",[34] reminiscent to that of American actress and singer Judy Garland.[35] O'Hara, who, after reading about the film in The New York Times,[36] competed for the role against 500 hopefuls,[37] believes the fact that lyricist Howard Ashman admired her cast recording of the musical Show Boat proved integral in her being cast.[38]Production of Beauty and the Beast was to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than the traditional four-year Disney Feature Animation production schedule; this was due to the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film.[7] Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio, housed in the Air Way facility in Glendale, California. A smaller team at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida assisted the California team on several scenes, particularly the \"Be Our Guest\" number.[9]Beauty and the Beast was the second film, after The Rescuers Down Under, produced using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar.[9][28] The software allowed for a wider range of colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.[7]In addition, CAPS allowed easier combination of hand-drawn art with computer-generated imagery, which before had to be plotted to animation paper and then xeroxed and painted traditionally.[9][39] This technique was put to significant use during the \"Beauty and the Beast\" waltz sequence, in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer-generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated 3D space.[9][7] The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favor of traditional animation, but later, when the technology had improved, decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom.[27] The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation.[40]Ashman and Menken wrote the Beauty song score during the pre-production process in Fishkill, the opening operetta-styled \"Belle\" being their first composition for the film. Other songs included \"Be Our Guest,\" sung (in its original version) to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade, \"Gaston,\" a solo for the swaggering villain, \"Human Again,\" a song describing Belle and Beast's growing love from the objects' perspective, the love ballad \"Beauty and the Beast,\" and the climactic \"The Mob Song.\" As story and song development came to a close, full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City.[9] The Beauty songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately, in order to give the songs a cast album-like \"energy\" the filmmakers and songwriters desired.[7]During the course of production, many changes were made to the structure of the film, necessitating the replacement and re-purposing of songs. After screening a mostly animated version of the \"Be Our Guest\" sequence, story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father. Wise and Trousdale agreed, and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle. The film's title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production. Originally conceived as a rock-oriented song, it was changed to a slow, romantic ballad. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song, but she didn't think her voice was suited for the melody. When she voiced her doubts, Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take, and told her to perform the song as she saw fit. Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition, nailing the song in the one take asked of her. This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song. \"Human Again\" was dropped from the film before animation began, as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place.[9] This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place. \"Something There,\" in which Belle and Beast sing (via voiceover) of their growing fondness for each other, was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of \"Human Again.\"[7]Menken would later revise \"Human Again\" for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film's Special Edition re-release in 2002.[9][7] Ashman died of AIDS-related complications on March 14, 1991, eight months prior to the release of the film. He never saw the finished film, though he did get to see it in its unfinished format. Ashman's work on Aladdin was completed by another lyricist, Tim Rice. Before Ashman's death, members of the film's production team visited him after the film's well-received first screening, with Don Hahn commenting that \"the film would be a great success. Who'd have thought it?\", to which Ashman replied with \"I would.\" A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl: \"To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice, and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman: 1950–1991.\"[28] A pop version of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" theme, performed by Céline Dion and Peabo Bryson over the end credits, was released as a commercial single from the film's soundtrack, supported with a music video. The Dion/Bryson version of \"Beauty and the Beast\" became an international pop hit and performed considerably well on charts around the world. The song became Dion's second single to land within the top-10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number nine. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, \"Beauty and the Beast\" peaked at number two.[41][42] Outside of North America, the song peaked within the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top twenty in Australia, Netherlands and Ireland. The song sold over a million copies worldwide.[43] This version of the song was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the Grammys, and it won the Grammy for Dion and Bryson for Best Pop Duo/Group Vocal Performance.","running_time":"84 minutes","Release":"In a first-time accomplishment for The Walt Disney Company, an unfinished version of Beauty and the Beast was shown at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 1991.[44] The film was deemed a \"work in progress\" because roughly only 70% of the animation had been completed; storyboards and pencil tests were used in replacement of the remaining 30%.[45] Additionally, certain segments of the film that had already been finished were reverted to previous stages of completion. At the end of the screening, Beauty and the Beast received a 10-minute long standing ovation from the film festival audience.[28][46] The completed film would also be screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.[47] The finished film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on November 13, 1991, and went into wide release through Walt Disney Pictures on November 22.[46]The film was restored and remastered for its New Year's Day, 2002 re-release in IMAX theatres in a special edition edit including a new musical sequence. For this version of the film, much of the animation was cleaned up, a new sequence set to the deleted song \"Human Again\" was inserted into the film's second act, and a new digital master from the original CAPS production files was used to make the high resolution IMAX film negative.[48]A sing along edition of the film, hosted by Jordin Sparks, was released in select theaters on September 29 and October 2, 2010. Prior to the showing of the film Sparks showed an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the newly restored high definition animated classic and the making of her all-new Beauty and the Beast music video. There was also commentary from producer Don Hahn, interviews with the cast and an inside look at how the animation was created.[49][50]A Disney Digital 3D version of the film, the second of a traditionally animated film, was originally scheduled to be released in US theatres on February 12, 2010, but the project was postponed.[51] On August 25, 2011, Disney announced that the 3D version of the film would make its American debut at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre from September 2–15, 2011.[52] Disney spent less than $10 million on the 3D conversion.[53] After the successful 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney announced a wide 3D re-release of Beauty and the Beast in North America beginning January 13, 2012.[54]The film was released to VHS on October 30, 1992 as part of the Walt Disney Classics series, and was later put on moratorium on April 30, 1993; it was not included in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line.[55] This version contains a minor edit to the film: skulls that appear in Gaston's pupils for two frames during his climactic fall to his death were removed for the original home video release. No such edit was made to later reissues of the film. The \"work-in-progress\" version screened at the New York Film Festival was also released on VHS and Laserdisc at this time;[7] however, said version was the only one available on the latter format until the fall of 1993 when the completed theatrical version was released. This measure was to diminish the threat of video pirates making copies derived from the laserdisc (which are not copy-protected) and selling them in international markets, where the film was yet to be available for home release.[56][57]Beauty and the Beast: Special Edition, as the enhanced version of the film released in IMAX/large-format is called, was released on 2-Disc \"Platinum Edition\" DVD and VHS on October 8, 2002. The DVD set features three versions of the film: the extended IMAX Special Edition with the \"Human Again\" sequence added, the original theatrical version, and the New York Film Festival \"work-in-progress\" version. This release went to \"Disney Vault\" moratorium status in January 2003, along with its direct-to-video follow-ups Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas and Belle's Magical World.[58]The film was released from the vault on October 5, 2010 as the second of Disney's Diamond Editions, in the form of a 3-disc Blu-ray Disc and DVD combination pack;[59] representing the first release of Beauty and the Beast on home video in high-definition format.[60] This edition consists of four versions of the film: the original theatrical version, an extended version, the New York Film Festival storyboard-only version, and a fourth iteration displaying the storyboards via picture-in-picture alongside the original theatrical version.[61] A two-disc DVD edition was released on November 23, 2010.[59] A 5-disc combo pack, featuring Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD and Digital copy, was released on October 4, 2011. The 3D combo pack is identical to the original Diamond Edition, except for the added 3D disc and digital copy. The Blu-ray release went into the Disney Vault along with the two sequels on April 30, 2012.[62]A 25th anniversary Signature Edition will be available on Digital HD September 6, 2016 and on Blu-ray/DVD combo pack September 20, 2016.[62]","budget":"$25 million[2]","beauty_and_the_beast":"North American theatrical teaser poster for the film, designed by John Alvin[1]","screenplay_by":"Linda Woolverton","Plot":"An enchantress, disguised as an old beggar, offers a rose to a young prince, in exchange for shelter in his castle from the cold, but the prince refuses.

The website's general consensus reads, \"Enchanting, sweepingly romantic, and featuring plenty of wonderful musical numbers, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's most elegant animated offerings.\"[63] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.[64]Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, \"Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too.\"[65] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars.[66] James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as \"the finest animated movie ever made\", writing, \"Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation.\"[67] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights.[7] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film \"A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time.\"[68] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying \"It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right.\"[69] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents..... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past.\"[70]Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"It's not an especially scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite.\"[71] John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off.\"[72] Gene Siskel also of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children.\"[73] Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying \"It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit.\"[74] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film.[75] Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's \"greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics\".[76]Animation historian Michael Barrier wrote that Belle \"becomes a sort of intellectual less by actually reading books, it seems, than by hanging out with them\", but says that the film comes closer than other \"Disney-studio\" films to \"accepting challenges of the kind that the finest Walt Disney features met\".[77] David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework, although her role is somewhat undefined in the same way that \"contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught, multiple responsibilities of the working mother\". Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences, such as the film's critical view of Gaston's chauvinism and attitude towards nature, the cyborg-like servants, and the father's role as an inventor rather than a merchant.[78] IGN named Beauty and the Beast as the greatest animated film of all time, directly ahead of WALL-E, The Incredibles, Toy Story 2, and The Iron Giant.[79]During its initial release in 1991, the film was a significant success at the box office, with $145,863,363 in revenues in North America and $351,863,363 worldwide.[2] It ranked as the third most-successful film of 1991 in North America, surpassed only by the summer blockbusters Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.[80] At the time Beauty and the Beast was the most successful animated Disney film release, and the first animated film to reach $100 million in North America.[81][82] In its IMAX re-release, it earned $25,487,190 in North America and $5,546,156 in other territories for a worldwide total of $31,033,346.[83] It also earned $9,818,365 from its 3D re-release overseas.[2] During the opening weekend of its North American 3D re-release in 2012, Beauty and the Beast grossed $17.8 million, coming in at the No. 2 spot behind Contraband, and achieved the highest opening weekend for an animated film in January.[84][85] The film was expected to make $17.5 million over the weekend, however, the results topped its forecast and the expectations of box office analysts.[86][87] The re-release ended its run on May 3, 2012 and earned $47,617,067, which brought the film's total gross in North America to $218,967,620.[88] It made an estimated $206,000,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $424,967,620.[2]Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's song \"Beauty and the Beast\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, while Menken's score won the award for Best Original Score.[89] Two other Menken and Ashman songs from the film, \"Belle\" and \"Be Our Guest\", were also nominated for Best Original Song.[89] Beauty and the Beast was the first picture to receive three Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song, a feat that would be repeated by The Lion King (1994), Dreamgirls (2006), and Enchanted (2007).[89] Academy rules have since been changed to limit each film to two nominations in this category, due to the consecutive unintentional failures of Dreamgirls and Enchanted to win the award.[89] The film was also nominated for Best Sound and Best Picture.[89] It was the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, and remained the only animated film nominated until 2010, when the Best Picture field was widened to ten nominees, and it is the only animated film nominated for the award when it had five nominees.[89] It lost the Best Picture award to The Silence of the Lambs.[89] It became the first musical in twelve years to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture of the Year following All That Jazz (1979) and the last one to be nominated until Moulin Rouge!

In the game's ending credits, the Beast turns back into the Prince. In Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days, the world is featured as a playable level but the story is not essential to the main plot. In Kingdom Hearts χ, the world is featured again and follows the plot of the movie more closely. The characters featured in the series are Beast, Belle, Lumiere, Gaston, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Maurice and the Wardrobe. Gaston and Maurice do not appear until Kingdom Hearts χ, which takes place before the main series. After Gaston is defeated, the world's primary antagonist becomes Xaldin, an original character created for the series, but who shares several traits with Forte, the main antagonist of Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas.[138]"}
