{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A psychoanalyst and his young family and some friends are taken hostage by a gang led by an escaped killer, Al Walker. The doctor gets the killer to talk to him in an attempt to find out the killer's unconscious motivation for his evil ways. | Walker relates a dramatic dream he's been having since childhood. Eventually, his crimes are traced back to his childhood and lack of parental guidance, and by the end of the night the doctor has calmed the killer's murderous rage and prevented any further killings.","m_cast":"William Holden as Al Walker | Nina Foch as Betty | Lee J.

As counterpoint is Lee J. Cobb's equally fine portrait of the unflustered scientist who is dedicated to 'curing people not killing them.' And, Nina Foch does a competently restrained job as the gangster's moll, who learns he's suffering from an Oedipus complex. The doctor's house guests, including Steven Geray, Adele Jergens and Wilton Graff, and their captors, especially Berry Kroeger, give unobtrusive but neat characterizations. Neat, too, is the word for this small but well-made Christmas package.\"[2] | More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review stating the film was well acted, but called the film, \"... pure Hollywood hokum.\"[3]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Blind Alley 1935 play  by James Warwick","m_directed_by":"Rudolph Maté","m_produced_by":"Buddy Adler","m_screenplay_by":"Philip MacDonald Michael Blankfort Albert Duffy","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"William Holden Nina Foch Lee J.
