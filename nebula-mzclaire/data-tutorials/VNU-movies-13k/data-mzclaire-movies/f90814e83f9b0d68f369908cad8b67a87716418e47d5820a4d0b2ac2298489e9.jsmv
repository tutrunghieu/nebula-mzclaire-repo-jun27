The film is conceived as a documentary, but incorporates lengthy sections of experimental films produced by the filmmakers. The premise is that von Trier has created a challenge for his friend and mentor, Jørgen Leth, another renowned filmmaker. von Trier's favorite film is Leth's The Perfect Human (1967), and von Trier gives Leth the task of remaking The Perfect Human five times, each time with a different \"obstruction\" (or obstacle) imposed by von Trier.[1] | It has been said that \"[b]oth this film and Dogville show a more mature von Trier, one who is more aware of and accountable to the full implications of the torture, suffering and victimization he has employed in his films, especially in exploring how easily those who victimize others in the name of righteousness become victims [of] their own self-righteousness.\"[2] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ A.
