{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Dress is a tale filled with sex, violence, misery, comedy and drama as it follows the life of a dress and parade of lives. Conceived under a cloud of frustration and despair by the dressmaker, the dress becomes a wheel of misfortune in extraordinary sequence of events that envelopes both the dress and those fatefully drawn into its universe. An aloof artist, a school girl, an unfulfilled maid, a borderline train conductor and a broken business executive, all become involuntary players in a macabre game of tag. No one who comes in contact with the dress until it reaches its destination.","m_cast":"Henri Garcin ... Van Tilt | Ingeborg Elzevier ... Mrs. Van Tilt | Khaldoun Elmecky ... Cremer | Margo Dames ...
