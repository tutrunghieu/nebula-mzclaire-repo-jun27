{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Phelps Department Store owner Hiram Phelps has died, leaving half-ownership in the business to his nephew, singer Tommy Rogers. The other half is owned by Hiram's sister, Martha Phelps (Margaret Dumont), Tommy's aunt. Rogers has no interest in running a department store, so he plans to sell his interest and use the money to build a music conservatory. Store manager Grover (Douglas Dumbrille) wants to kill Rogers before he can sell his share, marry the wealthy Martha, then kill her to become sole owner of the Phelps Department Store. Martha is highly suspicious, worried about Tommy's safety lest anyone suspect her of foul play to take over the store. Against Grover's wishes she hires Wolf J. Flywheel (Groucho) as a floorwalker and bodyguard. Between Tommy wooing his sweetheart Joan (Virginia Grey) and Flywheel romancing Miss Phelps, the brothers eventually expose and thwart the plot to kill Tommy. | The film has two extended scenes, one of them in the store's bed department, which has all kinds of novel beds that come out of the walls. The second lengthy scene takes place near the end of the film: Groucho, Chico and Harpo escape their pursuers during a madcap chase through the entire store, using the elevator, a staircase, chandeliers, roller skates, a mail chute and a bicycle. This chase involves an unusual amount of Mack Sennett-type slapstick stunts for a Marx Brothers movie. | One gag breaks the fourth wall, during the \"Sing While You Sell\" sequence: while Groucho is narrating a fashion show, he asides \"This is a bright red dress, but Technicolor is so expensive.\" Later in the film, Groucho breaks the fourth wall again when he comments \"I told you in the first reel [Grover] was a crook.\"","m_cast":"Groucho Marx - Wolf J.

If one were entirely truthful one would have to admit that the picture has many a dull stretch, that the tricks have been overworked, that the boys are slowing down, etc., etc. But with Marxian adherents—among whom we most decidedly belong—the question is simply, Are the Marx Brothers in it? They are.\"[1] A review in Variety called it a \"moderate comedy where dull stretches overshadow the several socko laugh sequences during a bumpy unfolding ... Marx Bros. repeat their familiar antics without much variation from previous appearances.\"[2] Film Daily suggested that a couple of the chase scenes were \"a little lengthy\" but still concluded, \"A 'laugh clocker' could run a high total checking this and the preview audience seemed to love it.\"[3] John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that the film was \"not great Marx material, not a film that collectors will exhibit as a sample of this era's humor, but again and again the old flash is there.\"[4] | The film made a profit of only $33,000.
