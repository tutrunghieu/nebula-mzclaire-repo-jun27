With the domestic gross at $75,847,266, the film gained more than a quarter of the earnings of its theme-ride predecessor Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film achieved better in foreign markets, with an overseas total of $106,443,000.[1] | The Haunted Mansion received a 13% rating with critical response aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 172 reviews, with the general consensus that it was \"neither scary nor funny, The Haunted Mansion is as lifeless as the ghosts in the movie\". Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times described the movie as \"More creepy than scary, but it's lots of fun\". J. C. Farrow reviewed the movie as \"Swirling apparitions, a wonderful Southern gothic atmosphere and a thwarted love story make this a fine companion piece to the Walt Disney theme-park attraction\".[2]","m_production":"The mansion scenes were filmed at Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. The main building was constructed over a period of weeks while the cupola and chimneys on the top of the mansion were computer generated. The paperboy in the opening scene is the nephew of the director, Rob Minkoff. A Hidden Mickey is briefly seen when Ramsley pours the poison in the goblet of wine during the wedding. Upon leaving the mansion via ghost carriage to find the mausoleum, Ezra exclaims \"there's always my way,\" a pivotal line of dialogue from the hanging scene in the Disney theme park ride. | The costume and special effects designers wanted the ghost characters to become \"more dead\" the farther they were from the mansion. Note that while Ezra and Emma look human in the house, their leaving it causes them to become blue and transparent. The zombies in the mausoleum are the \"deadest,\" as they are farthest away. | This was the first film to air on Disney Channel to contain any profanity besides \"hell\" or \"damn.\" It also contained the phrase \"Big ass termites!\", uttered by Murphy. | The scene where Edward hangs himself, taken specifically from the \"room-stretching\" portion of the Disney theme park ride, is usually cut from the broadcasts.[citation needed] | The design of the mansion is loosely based on Disneyland's version of The Haunted Mansion while the iron/glass conservatory was based on Walt Disney World's version of the ride. | In the opening scene of the film, Nathaniel Parker had great difficulty trying to carry Elizabeth up the staircase, which is shown on the expressions of his face. This was due to her slippery silk dress.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Haunted Mansion (attraction at Disney Parks)","m_directed_by":"Rob Minkoff","m_produced_by":"Andrew Gunn Don Hahn","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Eddie Murphy Terence Stamp Nathaniel Parker Marsha Thomason Jennifer Tilly","m_music_by":"Mark Mancina","m_cinematography":"Remi Adefarasin","m_edited_by":"Priscilla Nedd-Friendly","m_production_company":"Walt Disney Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"November 26, 2003 (2003-11-26)","m_running_time":"88 minutes","m_country":null,"m_language":"English","m_budget":"$90 million[1]","m_box_office":"$182.3 million[1] | The Haunted Mansion is a 2003 American horror fantasy comedy film[2] based on the attraction of the same name at Disney theme parks.
