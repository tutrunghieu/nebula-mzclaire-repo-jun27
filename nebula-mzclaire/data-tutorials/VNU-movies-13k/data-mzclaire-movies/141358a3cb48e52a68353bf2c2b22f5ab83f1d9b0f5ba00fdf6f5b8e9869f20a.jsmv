{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The galaxy is in a civil war. Spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of destroying planets. Rebel leader Princess Leia has the plans, but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil Sith lord Darth Vader. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of an astromech droid, R2-D2, along with a holographic recording. The droid flees to the surface of the desert planet Tatooine with fellow droid C-3PO. | The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning R2-D2, Luke accidentally triggers part of Leia's message, in which she requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2 searching for Obi-Wan, and meets Ben Kenobi, an old hermit who lives in the hills and reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as a Jedi Knight, former Galactic Republic peacekeepers with supernatural powers derived from an energy called The Force who were wiped out by the Empire. Contrary to his uncle's statements, Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan tells Luke that Vader was his former pupil who turned to the dark side of the Force and killed Luke's father, Anakin. Obi-Wan offers Luke his father's lightsaber, a Jedi weapon. | Obi-Wan views Leia's complete message, in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan and give them to her father for analysis. Obi-Wan invites Luke to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force. Luke declines, but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers searching for C-3PO and R2-D2 have destroyed his home and killed his aunt and uncle. Obi-Wan and Luke hire smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee first mate Chewbacca to transport them to Alderaan on Han's ship, the Millennium Falcon. | Upon the Falcon's arrival at the location of Alderaan, the group discover that the planet has been destroyed by order of the Death Star's commanding officer, Grand Moff Tarkin, as a show of power. The Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. While Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, Luke discovers that Leia is imprisoned aboard and, with the help of Han and Chewbacca, rescues her. After several escapes, the group makes its way back to the Falcon. Obi-Wan disables the tractor beam and, on the way back to the Falcon, engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. Once he is sure the others can escape, Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed. The Falcon escapes the Death Star, unknowingly carrying a tracking beacon, which the Empire follows to the Rebels' hidden base on Yavin IV. | The Rebels analyze the Death Star's plans and identify a vulnerable exhaust port that connects to the station's main reactor. Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron, while Han collects his payment for the transport and intends to leave, despite Luke's request that he stay and help. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses after several unsuccessful attack runs, leaving Luke one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. Leia awards Luke and Han with medals for their heroism.","m_cast":"Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: a young man raised by his aunt and uncle on Tatooine, who dreams of something more than his current life and learns the way of a Jedi. | Harrison Ford as Han Solo: a cynical smuggler hired by Obi-Wan and Luke to take them to Alderaan in his ship, the Millennium Falcon, co-piloted with Chewbacca. | Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia: a member of the Imperial Senate and leader of the Rebel Alliance. | Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin: Governor of the Imperial Outland Regions and commander of the Death Star. | Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi: an aging Jedi Master who fought during the Clone Wars, survivor of the Great Jedi Purge, and who introduces Luke to the Force. | David Prowse as Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones): A Sith lord, second in command of the Galactic Empire, who hopes to destroy the Rebel Alliance. | Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: a protocol droid who speaks over six million languages. | Kenny Baker as R2-D2: an astromech droid who is carrying the Death Star plans and a secret message for Obi-Wan from Princess Leia. | Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: a 200-year-old Wookiee, Han Solo's sidekick, and first mate of the Millennium Falcon. | Other actors include Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser, respectively, as Owen and Beru, Luke's uncle and aunt; Jack Purvis, Kenny Baker's partner in his London comedy act, as the Chief Jawa in the film; Eddie Byrne as Vanden Willard, a Rebel general; Denis Lawson and Garrick Hagon as rebel pilots Wedge Antilles and Biggs Darklighter (Luke's childhood friend), respectively; and Don Henderson and Leslie Schofield as Imperial Generals Cassio Tagge and Moradmin Bast, respectively.","m_reception":"Star Wars remains one of the most financially successful films of all time. The film earned $1,554,475 through its opening weekend ($6.07 million in 2015 dollars), building up to $7 million weekends as it entered wide release ($27.3 million in 2015 dollars).[5] It replaced Jaws as the highest-earning film in North America just six months into release,[137] eventually earning over $220 million during its initial theatrical run ($859 million in 2015 dollars).[138] Star Wars entered international release towards the end of the year, and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one,[139] earning $410 million in total.[140] Reissues in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982 brought its cumulative gross in Canada and the U.S. to $323 million,[141] and extended its global earnings to $530 million.[142] The film remained the highest-grossing film of all time until E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial broke that record in 1983.[143] | Following the release of the Special Edition in 1997,[144] Star Wars briefly reclaimed the North American record before losing it again the following year to Titanic.[145] In total, the film has earned $775,398,007 worldwide (including $460,998,007 in North America alone).[5] Adjusted for inflation, it has earned over $2.5 billion worldwide at 2011 prices, making it the most successful franchise film of all time.[146] According to Guinness World Records, the film ranks as the third-highest-grossing film when adjusting for inflation;[147] at the North American box office, it ranks second behind Gone with the Wind on the inflation-adjusted list.[148] | \"What makes the Star Wars experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie — violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark's jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in Star Wars (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize.\" | The film was met with critical acclaim upon its release. In his 1977 review, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \"an out-of-body experience\", compared its special effects to those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and opined that the true strength of the film was its \"pure narrative\".[149] Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \"the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure\" and \"the most elaborate, most expensive, most beautiful movie serial ever made.\"[150] A.D. Murphy of Variety described the film as \"magnificent\" and claimed George Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the \"biggest possible adventure fantasy\" based on the serials and older action epics from his childhood.[151] Writing for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, writing that the film \"is a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler.\"[152] However, the film was not without its detractors: Pauline Kael of The New Yorker criticized Star Wars, stating that \"there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism\", and that it had no \"emotional grip\".[153] John Simon of New York magazine also panned the film and wrote, \"Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality.\"[154] Stanley Kauffmann, reviewing the film in The New Republic, opined that it \"was made for those (particularly males) who carry a portable shrine within them of their adolescence, a chalice of a Self that was Better Then, before the world's affairs or—in any complex way—sex intruded.\"[155] | British press for the film was positive. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian concluded that the film \"plays enough games to satisfy the most sophisticated.\"[156] The Daily Telegraph's Adrian Berry said that Star Wars \"is the best such film since 2001 and in certain respects it is one of the most exciting ever made.\" He described the plot as \"unpretentious and pleasantly devoid of any 'message.'\"[157] In his review for BBC, Matt Ford awarded the film five out of five stars and wrote, \"Star Wars isn't the best film ever made, but it is universally loved.\"[158] | The film continues to receive critical acclaim from modern critics. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 94% positive based on 99 reviews with an overall rating of 8.5/10. Its consensus states in summary, \"A legendary expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opens our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster film-making and things have never been the same.\"[159] Metacritic reports an aggregate score of 92 out of 100 (based on 14 reviews), indicating \"universal acclaim\".[160] In his 1997 review of the film's 20th anniversary release, Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying, \"A grandiose and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart.\"[161] A San Francisco Chronicle staff member described the film as \"a thrilling experience.\"[162] | Gene Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune in 1999, said, \"What places it a sizable cut about the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick's 2001.\"[163] Andrew Collins of Empire magazine awarded the film five out of five and said, \"Star Wars' timeless appeal lies in its easily identified, universal archetypes—goodies to root for, baddies to boo, a princess to be rescued and so on—and if it is most obviously dated to the 70s by the special effects, so be it.\"[164] In his 2009 review, Robert Hatch of The Nation called the film \"an outrageously successful, what will be called a 'classic,' compilation of nonsense, largely derived but thoroughly reconditioned. I doubt that anyone will ever match it, though the imitations must already be on the drawing boards.\"[165] In a more critical review, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader stated, \"None of these characters has any depth, and they're all treated like the fanciful props and settings.\"[166] Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix said, \"Star Wars is a junkyard of cinematic gimcracks not unlike the Jawas' heap of purloined, discarded, barely functioning droids.\"[167] | The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. Star Wars won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. A Special Achievement for Sound Effects Editing went to sound designer Ben Burtt[168] and a Scientific and Engineering Award went to John Dykstra for the development of the Dykstraflex Camera (shared with Alvah J. Miller and Jerry Jeffress, who were both granted for the engineering of the Electronic Motion Control System).[169] Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, which were instead awarded to Woody Allen's Annie Hall.[168] | At the 35th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Alec Guinness), and it won the award for Best Score.[170] It received six British Academy Film Awards nominations: Best Film, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Production/Art Design, Best Sound, and Best Score; the film won in the latter two categories.[171] John Williams' soundtrack album won the Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score for a Motion Picture or Television Program,[172] and the film attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[173] | The film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction and Best Writing for George Lucas, Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness, Best Music for John Williams, Best Costume for John Mollo, Best Make-up for Rick Baker and Stuart Freeborn, Best Special Effects for John Dykstra and John Stears, and Outstanding Editing for Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew.[174]","m_production":"Elements of the history of Star Wars are commonly disputed, as George Lucas's statements about it have changed over time. One of the claims is that he intended to make the movie a Space Western.[a 1] Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138—that he first had an idea for a space fantasy film,[29] though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then.[30] Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young.[31] In 1979, he said, \"I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials... Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were... loving them that much when they were so awful, I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well.\"[32] | At the Cannes Film Festival in May following the completion of THX 1138, Lucas was granted a two-film development deal with United Artists; the two films were American Graffiti, and an untitled Flash Gordon-esque space fantasy film. He pushed towards buying the Flash Gordon rights.[32] He said: | I wanted to make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the original Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called Gulliver on Mars, written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.[29] | Director Francis Ford Coppola, who accompanied Lucas in buying the Flash Gordon rights, recounted in 1999, \"[George] was very depressed because he had just come back and they wouldn't sell him Flash Gordon. And he says, 'Well, I'll just invent my own.'\"[32] Lucas envisioned his own space opera and called it The Star Wars.[33] After his failed attempt to gain the rights, Lucas went to United Artists and showed the script for American Graffiti, but they passed on the film, which was then picked up by Universal Pictures.[33] United Artists also passed on Lucas's The Star Wars concept, which he shelved for the time being.[34] After spending the next two years completing American Graffiti, Lucas turned his attention to The Star Wars.[29][33] | Lucas began writing in January 1973, \"eight hours a day, five days a week\",[29] by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations. Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written, but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels. He revived others decades later when he wrote his prequel trilogy. He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two-page synopsis titled Journal of the Whills, which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a \"Jedi-Bendu\" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.[35] Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand,[36] Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had thematic parallels with Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress.[37] | After United Artists declined to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its options for the film because the concept was \"a little strange\", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes.[28] Lucas said, \"I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films.\"[28] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, \"just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience.\"[38] He said that \"science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... what seems to be the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year.\"[39] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not \"about the future\" and that it \"is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to 2001\". He added: \"My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?\"[28] Kurtz said, \"Although Star Wars wasn't like that at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of [science fiction] category.\"[38] | There were also concerns regarding the project's potentially high budget. Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching the film, said that it would be \"low-budget, Roger Corman style, and the budget was never going to be more than—well, originally we had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10. Both of those figures are very low budget by Hollywood standards at the time.\"[38] After Walt Disney Productions, who later bought Lucasfilm in December 2012,[40] rejected the project,[41] Lucas and Kurtz persisted in securing a studio to support the film because \"other people had read it and said, 'Yeah, it could be a good idea...'\"[38] Lucas pursued Alan Ladd, Jr., the head of 20th Century Fox, and in June 1973 completed a deal to write and direct the film. Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd \"invested in me, he did not invest in the movie.\"[11] The deal gave Lucas $150,000 to write and direct the film.[22] | \"It's the flotsam and jetsam from the period when I was twelve years old. All the books and films and comics that I liked when I was a child. The plot is simple—good against evil—and the film is designed to be all the fun things and fantasy things I remember. The word for this movie is fun.\" | Since commencing his writing process in January 1973, Lucas had done \"various rewrites in the evenings after the day's work.\" He would write four different screenplays for Star Wars, \"searching for just the right ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story.\"[29] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role as a member of a family of dwarfs.[11][25] Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's \"co-pilot\" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.[25] | Lucas began researching the science fiction genre by watching films and reading books and comics.[42] His first script incorporated ideas from many new sources. The script would also introduce the concept of a Jedi Master father and his son, who trains to be a Jedi under his father's friend; this would ultimately form the basis for the film and, later, the trilogy. However, in this draft, the father is a hero who is still alive at the start of the film.[43] | Lucas completed a second draft of The Star Wars in January 1975, making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. \"The Force\" was also introduced as a mystical energy field.[44] This second draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships. For example, Luke had several brothers, as well as his father, who appears in a minor role at the end of the film. The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the action-adventure of the previous versions. This version ended with another text crawl, previewing the next story in the series. This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side: the draft included a historical Jedi who became the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it. Impressed with his works, Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes around this time. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.[45] | A third draft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled The Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller. This third draft had most of the elements of the final plot, with only some differences in the characters and settings. The draft characterized Luke as an only child, with his father already dead, replacing him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi.[44] This script would be re-written for the fourth and final draft, dated January 1, 1976, as The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars. Lucas worked with his friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to revise the fourth draft into the final pre-production script.[46] 20th Century Fox approved a budget of $8.25 million; American Graffiti's positive reception afforded Lucas the leverage necessary to renegotiate his deal with Alan Ladd, Jr. and request the sequel rights to the film. For Lucas, this deal protected Star Wars' unwritten segments and most of the merchandising profits.[11] | Lucas finished writing his script in March 1976, when the crew started filming. He said, \"What finally emerged through the many drafts of the script has obviously been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventure I've read and seen. And I've seen a lot of it. I'm trying to make a classic sort of genre picture, a classic space fantasy in which all the influences are working together. There are certain traditional aspects of the genre I wanted to keep and help perpetuate in Star Wars.\"[29] During production, he changed Luke's name from Starkiller to Skywalker[11] and altered the title to The Star Wars and later Star Wars.[44] He would also continue to tweak the script during filming, including adding the death of Obi-Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film.[47][48] | For the film's opening crawl, Lucas originally wrote a composition consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each.[22] He said, \"The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem.\" Lucas showed his draft to his friends.[49] Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: \"The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish.\"[50] Lucas recounted what De Palma said the first time he saw it: \"George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you.\" De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.[49] | George Lucas recruited many conceptual designers, including Colin Cantwell, who worked on 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual storyboard sketches of early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters, costumes, props and scenery.[29] McQuarrie's pre-production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas's early screenplay drafts helped 20th Century Fox visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project. After McQuarrie's drawings for Lucas's colleagues Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins (who were collaborating for a film) caught his interest, Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss his plans for the then-untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make. Two years later, after completing American Graffiti, Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested \"in doing something for Star Wars.\"[51] McQuarrie produced a series of artworks from simple sketches; these set a visual tone for the film, and for the rest of the original trilogy.[29] | \"Star Wars has no points of reference to Earth time or space, with which we are familiar, and it is not about the future but some galactic past or some extra-temporal present, it is a decidedly inhabited and used place where the hardware is taken for granted.\" | The film was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) that had never been realized before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: \"George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real.\" They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas \"didn't want anything [in Star Wars] to stand out, he wanted it [to look] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'\"[53] | Lucas described a \"used future\" concept to the production designers in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty.[11][54][55] Instead of following the traditional sleekness and futuristic architecture of science fiction films that came before, the Star Wars sets were designed to look inhabited and used. Barry said that the director \"wants to make it look like its shot on location on your average everyday Death Star or Mos Eisley Spaceport or local cantina.\" Lucas believed that \"what is required for true credibility is a used future\", opposing the interpretation of \"future in most futurist movies\" that \"always looks new and clean and shiny.\"[52] Christian supported Lucas's vision, saying \"All science fiction before was very plastic and stupid uniforms and Flash Gordon stuff. Nothing was new. George was going right against that.\"[53] | The designers started working with the director before Star Wars was approved by 20th Century Fox.[53] For four to five months, in a studio in Kensal Rise, England,[53][56] they attempted to plan the creation of the props and sets with \"no money\". Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from American Graffiti, it was inadequate. As they could not afford to dress the sets, Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look. He suggested that Lucas use scrap in making the dressings, and the director agreed.[53] Christian said, \"I've always had this idea. I used to do it with models when I was a kid. I'd stick things on them and we'd make things look old.\"[56] Barry, Christian, and their team began designing the props and sets at Elstree Studios.[52] | According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was the most difficult to build. Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine.[53] He found scrap airplane metal \"that no one wanted in those days and bought them\".[56] He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to \"stick it in the sets in specific ways\".[53] It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as \"the most encrusted set\") in the hold of the Falcon. The garbage compactor set \"was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around\".[53] A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage is the largest in Europe.[52] | In 1975, Lucas formed his own visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California. Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras.[11] | George Lucas tried \"to get a cohesive reality\" for his feature. However, since the film is a fairy tale, as he had described, \"I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look.\" He designed the film to have an \"extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with strange over-exposed colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas.\" Lucas wanted Star Wars to embrace the combination of \"strange graphics of fantasy\" and \"the feel of a documentary\" to impress a distinct look. To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor.[52] Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth, who also provided the cinematography for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.[38] Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz. However, he eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli-directed A Matter of Time (1976) instead, which \"really annoy[ed]\" Kurtz.[38] Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day's Night (1964). On his decision, Lucas said: \"I thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor.\"[52] | Taylor said that Lucas, who was consumed by the details of the complicated production, \"avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times and made my own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture.\" He also \"took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved on to our two weeks of location work in Tunisia.\"[57] During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called \"old-school\" and \"crotchety\"[58]—had disputes over filming.[38] With a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look.[58] Kurtz stated that \"In a couple of scenes [...] rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [Lucas would] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment about what to do with my lights.'\"[38] | Originally, Lucas envisioned the planet of Tatooine, where much of the film would take place, as a jungle planet. Gary Kurtz traveled to the Philippines to scout locations; however, because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas \"itchy\", the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead.[59] Kurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern deserts, and found Tunisia, near the Sahara desert, as the ideal location.[52] In the director's commentary of the 2004 DVD edition of a A New Hope, Lucas said he wanted to also make it look more \"spacy\" or outer space-like in style. | When principal photography began on March 22, 1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems.[60] Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns.[60][61] Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, \"you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur.\" Given this situation, Lucas requested for heavy filtration, which confused Taylor, who said: \"I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together. I told him it wouldn't work, but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film, all diffused.\" This difference was later settled by 20th Century Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.[62] | Filming began in Chott el Djerid, while a construction crew in Tozeur took eight weeks to transform the desert into the desired setting.[52] Other locations included the sand dunes of the Tunisian desert near Nafta, where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make their way across the sands was filmed.[63] When actor Anthony Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit for the first time in Tunisia, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him.[61] He also could not see through his costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion.[59] Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio-controlled R2-D2 models run out of control. Kenny Baker, who portrayed R2-D2, said: \"I was incredibly grateful each time an [R2] would actually work right.\"[59] After several scenes were filmed against the volcanic canyons outside Tozeur, production moved to Matmata to film Luke's home on Tatooine. Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss, which is larger than the typical underground dwellings, to shoot the interior of Luke's homestead.[63] Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at Death Valley in North America.[64] | After completing two and a half weeks of filming in Tunisia,[63] the cast and crew moved into the more controlled environment of Elstree Studios, near London.[61] Difficulties encountered in Tunisia were assumed to cease; however, due to strict British working conditions adhered to on set, a new problem arose: filming had to finish by 5:30 pm, unless Lucas was in the middle of a scene.[22] The interiors were shot in London due to its proximity to North Africa and because of the availability of top technical crew at Elstree Studios. The film studio was the only one of its kind in Britain or America that could cater nine large stages at the same time and allow the company complete freedom to use its own personnel.[52] Despite Lucas' efforts, his crew had little interest in the film and did not take the project seriously. Most of the crew considered the project a \"children's film\", rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.[11][65] Actor Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure. Harrison Ford found it strange that \"there's a princess with weird buns in her hair\", and he called Chewbacca a \"giant in a monkey suit\".[11] | Filming at Elstree Studios became another problem for Taylor; the sets John Barry made \"were like a coal mine\", as the cinematographer described. He said that \"they were all black and gray, with really no opportunities for lighting at all.\" To resolve the problem, he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls, ceiling and floors. This would result in \"a 'cut-out' system of panel lighting\", with quartz lamps that could be placed in the holes in the walls, ceiling and floors. His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that \"we couldn't have this 'black hole of Calcutta'\". The lighting approach Taylor devised \"allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom.\"[62] In total, filming the scenes in Britain took 14 and a half weeks.[63] | The moon Yavin 4, which acted as the rebel base in the film, was filmed in the Mayan temples at Tikal, Guatemala. Lucas selected the location as a potential filming site after seeing a poster of it hanging at a travel agency while he was filming in Britain. This inspired him to send a film crew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot scenes. While filming in Tikal, the crew paid locals with a six pack of beer to watch over the camera equipment for several days.[66] | Lucas rarely spoke to the actors, who felt that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words \"faster\" and \"more intense\".[11] Kurtz stated that \"it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors really need a lot of pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job.\" Kurtz has said that Lucas \"wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors.\"[38] | Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts.[11][61] Initially, Fox approved $8 million for the project; Gary Kurtz said: \"we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa, and kind of pulled together some things. Then, it was obvious that 8 million wasn't going to do it—they had approved 8 million.\" After requests from the team that \"it had to be more\", the executives \"got a bit scared\".[38] For two weeks, Lucas and his crew \"didn't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures\". At the same time, after production fell behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. Kurtz said that \"it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in the end they just said, 'Yes, that's okay, we'll go ahead.'\"[38] The crew split into three units, with those units led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor Robert Watts. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.[11][61] | During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile, as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.[11][61] Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, Mark Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.[61] | Star Wars was originally slated for release on Christmas 1976; however, its production delays pushed the film's release to summer 1977. Already anxious about meeting his deadline, Lucas was shocked when editor John Jympson's first cut of the film was a \"complete disaster\". According to an article in Star Wars Insider No. 41 by David West Reynolds, this first edit of Star Wars contained about 30–40% different footage from the final version. After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced him with Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew. He also allowed his then-wife, Marcia Lucas, to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film New York, New York (1977) with Lucas's friend Martin Scorsese. Richard Chew found the film to have a lethargic pace and to have been cut in a by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in master shots that flowed into close-up coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously.[11] | Jympson's original assembly contained a large amount of footage which differed from the final cut of the film, including several alternate takes and a number of scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve the narrative pace. The most significant material cut was a series of scenes from the first part of the film which served to introduce the character of Luke Skywalker. These early scenes, set in Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine, presented the audience with Luke's everyday life among his friends as it is affected by the space battle above the planet; they also introduced the character of Biggs Darklighter, Luke's closest friend who departs to join the Rebellion.[67] Chew explained the rationale behind removing these scenes as a narrative decision: \"In the first five minutes, we were hitting everybody with more information than they could handle. There were too many story lines to keep straight: the robots and the Princess, Vader, Luke. So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs\".[68] After viewing a rough cut, Alan Ladd likened these Anchorhead scenes to \"American Graffiti in outer space\". Lucas was looking for a way of accelerating the storytelling, and removing Luke's early scenes would distinguish Star Wars from his earlier teenage drama and \"get that American Graffiti feel out of it\".[67] Lucas also stated that he wanted to move the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2: \"At the time, to have the first half-hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea.\"[69][70] | Meanwhile, Industrial Light & Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.[61] Moreover, theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline, forcing Lucas to intervene frequently to ensure that they were on schedule. With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial dogfights from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.[11] | During the chaos of production and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and sound effects. Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an \"organic soundtrack\". Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck. The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.[71] For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone.[72] | In February 1977, Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives, several director friends, along with Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics who were preparing a Star Wars comic book. The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse's voice for Darth Vader. It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and when the Millennium Falcon fought TIE fighters, the film cut to footage of World War II dogfights.[73] The reactions of the directors present, such as Brian De Palma, John Milius, and Steven Spielberg, disappointed Lucas. Spielberg, who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film, believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film; Gareth Wigan told Lucas: \"This is the greatest film I've ever seen\" and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.[11] The delays increased the budget from $8 million to $11 million.[74] | With the project $2 million over budget, Lucas was forced to make numerous artistic compromises to complete Star Wars. Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra $20,000 funding and in early 1977 second unit filming completed a number of sequences including exterior desert shots for Tatooine in Death Valley and China Lake Acres in California, and exterior Yavin jungle shots in Guatemala, along with additional studio footage to complete the Mos Eisley Cantina sequence. Lucas had planned to rework a confrontation scene between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt in Mos Eisley Spaceport by compositing a stop-motion animated model of Jabba to replace the actor Declan Mulholland, but with time and money running out, Lucas reluctantly decided to cut the scene entirely. The sequence was later re-instated in the 1997 Special Edition with a computer-generated version of Jabba.[75][76]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"George Lucas","m_produced_by":"Gary Kurtz","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mark Hamill | Harrison Ford | Carrie Fisher | Peter Cushing | Alec Guinness","m_music_by":"John Williams","m_cinematography":"Gilbert Taylor","m_edited_by":"Paul Hirsch | Marcia Lucas | Richard Chew | Uncredited: | George Lucas","m_production_company":"Lucasfilm Ltd.","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox[Note 1]","m_release_dates":"May 25, 1977 (1977-05-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"121 minutes[4]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$11 million[5][6]","m_box_office":"$775.4 million[5] | Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope[7][8]) is a 1977 American epic space opera[9][10] film written and directed by George Lucas. The first installment in the original Star Wars trilogy, it stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, and Alec Guinness. David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew co-star in supporting roles. | The plot focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmhand Luke Skywalker (Hamill) who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess stolen architectural plans for the Death Star. When the Empire begins a destructive search for the missing droids, Skywalker accompanies Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness) on a mission to return the plans to the Rebel Alliance and rescue Leia from her imprisonment by the Empire. | Star Wars was released theatrically in the United States on May 25, 1977. It earned $461 million in the U.S. and $314 million overseas, totaling $775 million. It surpassed Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film of all time, until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America, and the third-highest-grossing film in the world. The film received ten Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), winning seven. It was selected to become part of the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in its first year of opening as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"; at the time, it was the newest film to be selected, and it was the only film from the 1970s to be chosen. The film's soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry 15 years later. Today, it is often regarded as one of the best films of all time, as well as one of the most important films in the history of motion pictures. It also launched an industry of media tie-in products, including TV series spinoffs, novels, comic books, and video games, as well as various other merchandise, such as toys, games, clothing, and other paraphernalia. | The film's massive success led to the production of two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), both of which became critically and commercially successful. Since 1977, Star Wars was subsequently reissued multiple times at Lucas' behest, incorporating many changes including modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks, and added scenes. A prequel trilogy was later released between 1999 and 2005, followed by a sequel trilogy which began in 2015. |  | ","m_marketing":"While the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as Taxi Driver and The Exorcist. Perri devised a foreshortened STAR WARS logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl. In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees.[95][96] | The logotype eventually selected for on-screen used originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976. This brochure was designed by Suzy Rice, a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising. On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear \"very fascist\" in style. Rice's response to her brief was to use an outlined, modified Helvetica Black. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the S and T of STAR and the R and S of WARS. Lucas signed off the brochure in between takes while filming inserts for the Mos Eisley Cantina scene. Gary Kurtz was impressed with Rice's logo and selected it over Perri's design for the film's opening titles, after modifying the letter W to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice. This finalised the design of one of the most recognisable logos in cinema design, although Rice's contribution was not credited in the film.[95]","m_reference":"^ Masters, Kim (October 30, 2012). \"Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis)\".
