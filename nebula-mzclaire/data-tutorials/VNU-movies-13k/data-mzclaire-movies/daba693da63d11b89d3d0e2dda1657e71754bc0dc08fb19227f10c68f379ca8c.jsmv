{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the North American Pontifical College, in Rome, Father Maurice (Walther Matthaw) is in deep turmoil because of Patricia (Stefania Sandrelli), a woman who loves him and expects him to make up his mind and clear out his position towards her. While he is trying to do so, he is summoned by a novice for an emergency. The emergency turns out to be a fat woman possessed by a demon. Father Maurice performs the rite of exorcism and expels the demon from the woman. The demon (Roberto Benigni), a little escaped devil named Giuditta, having nowhere else to go, starts following Father Maurice everywhere and often indulges in mischief getting Maurice in trouble. In one instance Giuditta replaces a sick Father Maurice in Mass, turning the solemn ceremony in a beauty parade. Maurice tries to get rid of Giuditta in several failed efforts. Showing signs of exhaustion, his peers advise him to take a vacation. Eventually another agent \"from where Giuditta came from\" appears as Nina (Nicoletta Braschi) and manages to attract Giuditta who finally leaves Maurice and follows her \"elsewhere\".","m_cast":"Walter Matthau as Father Maurice | Roberto Benigni as Giuditta, the little devil | Stefania Sandrelli as Patrizia | Nicoletta Braschi as Nina | John Lurie as Cusatelli | Paolo Baroni as Saverio | Franco Fabrizi as Prete | Annabella Schiavone as Giuditta, the woman","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Roberto Benigni","m_produced_by":"Mauro Berardi Mario Cecchi Gori Vittorio Cecchi Gori","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Walter Matthau Roberto Benigni","m_music_by":"Evan Lurie","m_cinematography":"Robby MÃ¼ller","m_edited_by":"Nino Baragli","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 14, 1988","m_running_time":"110 min.","m_country":"Italy","m_language":"Italian and English | The Little Devil (original Italian name Il piccolo diavolo) is a 1988 Italian film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, also starring Walter Matthau, Stefania Sandrelli, Nicoletta Braschi and John Lurie.
