{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the late 2010s, \"The New Founding Fathers of America\" have been voted into office following economic collapse, and eventually sanction a national civic tradition called \"The Purge.\" The Purge occurs for 12 hours on March 21 to 22, from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. the next day, during which all crime is legal and all police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable. Restrictions prohibit government officials \"ranking 10\" from being disturbed, as well as the use of all weapons above Class 4 (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, and bazookas). The Purge has resulted in unemployment rates plummeting to 1%, low crime, and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, in reality, it is used as a method of artificial population control to superficially solve America's societal problems by killing off those citizens and groups seen as parasites or useless to society and to maintain a healthy upper and middle class, as the unemployed, the mentally ill, the disabled, the uneducated, the elderly and the poor in slum neighborhoods or the homeless are usually the main targets, and thus the burden on society is lessened. | On March 21, 2022, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) returns to his home in an affluent Los Angeles suburb to wait out the night with his wife, Mary, (Lena Headey) and their two children, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder). James is the top salesman for elaborate security systems designed specifically for Purge Night, and the family is assured that the security system manufactured by James' company will keep them safe. Their neighbors attribute the size and fittings of the newly extended Sandins' house to his success in selling security products to them for Purge Night. | While the family awaits the start of the Purge, Zoey sees her boyfriend Henry (Tony Oller), an older boy whom James dislikes. James enables the security system, and as the Purge begins, the family disperses in their home to go about their normal routines. | Zoey returns to her room to unexpectedly find Henry, who managed to sneak back in before the security system was engaged, and says that he plans to confront her dad about their relationship. Meanwhile, Charlie watches the security monitors and sees a wounded man calling for help. He temporarily disables the system to allow the man (Edwin Hodge) into the house. James races to re-engage the system and holds the man at gunpoint as Henry comes downstairs and pulls a gun on James. Henry fires at James and misses, but James fires back, mortally wounding and eventually killing Henry. During the chaos, the wounded man disappears and hides. James takes Mary and Charlie back to the security control room. | As James is reprimanding Charlie for letting the man into their home, they view over the surveillance cameras, where they see a gang of masked young adults armed with guns, axes and hammers coming up to the front lawn. Their leader (Rhys Wakefield) removes his mask and compliments the Sandins on their support of the Purge, and then tells them that if they do not give them the homeless man, they will be forced to \"release the beast,\" implying they will forcefully enter the house and kill everyone inside. Mary asks James if the security system will help protect them, but James admits the system is only supposed to discourage potential invaders and would not actually protect them against heavy force. | With their deadline having passed, the gang uses a truck to rip the metal plating off the front door and enter the house. Charlie views the surveillance cameras and notices the family's neighbors leaving their homes, and the group of neighbors overpowers the gang, though James is mortally wounded in the battle. | Mary thanks the neighbors for their support, but the neighbors reveal that they are angry at the Sandins for their wealth acquired by the money the neighbors paid the Sandins with for various security products. They tie Mary, Charlie and Zoey up with duct tape, pulling them out into the hallway to kill them. | As the neighbors make final preparations for the murder, the wounded man that gained entrance to the Sandins' home re-appears, shoots a neighbor to death and holds Grace Ferrin (Arija Bareikis), forcing the neighbors to free the Sandins. He asks if Mary wishes to kill the neighbors, but Mary spares them. Eventually, the sirens go off, announcing the end of the annual Purge. | News reports later state that this year's Purge is the most successful to date.","m_cast":"Ethan Hawke as James Sandin | Lena Headey as Mary Sandin | Max Burkholder as Charlie Sandin | Adelaide Kane as Zoey Sandin | Edwin Hodge as The Stranger[5] | Rhys Wakefield as Polite Leader | Tony Oller as Henry | Arija Bareikis as Grace Ferrin | Dana Bunch as Mr. Ferrin | Chris Mulkey as Mr. Halverson | Tisha French as Mrs. Halverson | Tom Yi as Mr. Cali | John Weselcouch as Interrupting Purger | Alicia Vela-Bailey as Female Purger | Aaron Kuban as Purger | Boima Blake as Purger | Nathan Clarkson as Purger | Chester Lockhart as Purger | Tyler Osterkamp as Purger | RJ Wolfe as Purger | Trazariah Shells as Purger | Karen Strassman as Newscaster","m_reception":"Rotten Tomatoes records a rating of 37% based on 139 reviews for The Purge, with a weighted average of 5.1/10, with the site's consensus stating, \"Half social allegory, half home-invasion thriller, The Purge attempts to use thriller formula to make an intelligent point—but ultimately only ends up sinking in numbing violence and tired cliches.\"[8] The film holds a score of 41 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 33 critics, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\".[9] | On io9, Charlie Jane Anders described it as \"a clunky and implausible political screed in movie form.\"[10] Entertainment Weekly gave The Purge a B−, saying that it \"clearly has a lot on its mind, but it never really manages to express it.\"[11] | In its opening weekend, The Purge topped the box office with $16.8 million on opening day and $34.1 million through the entire weekend.[12] The film has collected $64,473,115 domestically and $24,855,512 outside the United States, for a total of $89,328,627 worldwide, with a production budget of $3 million.[3]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"Due to the success of the first film, a sequel, The Purge: Anarchy, was developed by Universal and Blumhouse.
