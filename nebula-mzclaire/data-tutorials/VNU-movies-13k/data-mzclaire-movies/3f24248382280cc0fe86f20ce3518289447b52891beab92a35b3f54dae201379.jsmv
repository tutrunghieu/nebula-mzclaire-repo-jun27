{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After a violent thunderstorm, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leaves his wife Stephanie (Kelly Collins Lintz), and with their neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) goes into town to buy supplies for repairs. David brings his eight-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and Norton to a grocery store, where the patrons notice unusual police and military activity. Moments after a panicked and injured man (Jeffrey DeMunn) runs in warning of danger, a thick mist envelopes the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors and the town's tornado siren. A man disregards the warnings and is attacked while running to his car. | A mentally unstable religious woman, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), decides that this is the beginning of Armageddon. A shaken woman (Melissa McBride), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children and disappears. While investigating the store's generator, a bag-boy named Norm (Chris Owen) volunteers to go outside, but is snatched and pulled into the mist by a tentacle connected to an unseen monster. | Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, only to be attacked and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on the windows and pterodactyl-like animals attack them, breaking the glass and allowing the creatures to begin fighting inside the store. One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors. | A trip to the neighboring pharmacy to gather medical supplies goes horribly wrong and two people are killed by giant spiders. Mrs. Carmody's faction now contains most of the survivors. Two soldiers commit suicide, and a third, Private Jessup (Samuel Witwer), reveals that the local military base was filled with rumors about the Arrowhead Project, the government's attempt to look into other dimensions, and that the scientists responsible for the experiment may have inadvertently opened a doorway into a dimension containing the creatures that are now invading the town. Mrs. Carmody convinces her followers that it is Jessup's fault and he is stabbed and ejected from the store, quickly falling prey to a large praying mantis-like creature. | David and a handful of other survivors secretly gather supplies to flee, but are discovered by Mrs. Carmody. She attempts to have David and his group sacrificed, but Ollie shoots and kills her with Amanda Dumfries' (Laurie Holden) gun, horrifying her followers. They allow David's group to leave, but only David, Billy, Dan, Amanda, and Irene (Frances Sternhagen) make it to the car. | Driving through the mist, David finds his house destroyed and his wife dead. Heartbroken, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides there is no point in going on. David shoots the others rather than have them endure horrifying deaths, but is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived and restored order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, accompanied by her two children. David breaks down with the realization that they were only moments from being rescued and had been driving away from help the entire time.","m_cast":"Thomas Jane as David Drayton, a painter and film-poster artist trapped in the market with son Billy. | Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody, a fanatically religious woman. | Laurie Holden as Amanda Dumfries, a married teacher whose husband is away. | Jeffrey DeMunn as Dan Miller, a normal civilian who is the first to see the signs of danger from the mist. | Andre Braugher as Brent Norton, David's neighbor and an attorney who filed a lawsuit against David and lost. | Samuel Witwer as Private Wayne Jessup, a soldier trapped in the market. | Toby Jones as Ollie Weeks, the assistant manager of the market. | William Sadler as Jim Grondin, a weak-minded mechanic. | Frances Sternhagen as Irene Reppler, a third-grade teacher. | Nathan Gamble as Billy Drayton, David's eight-year-old son. | Alexa Davalos as Sally, a cashier at the market who is Billy's babysitter. | Chris Owen as Norm, a bag boy. | Robert Treveiler as Bud Brown, the supermarket manager. | David Jensen as Myron LaFleur, a mechanic. | Buck Taylor as Ambrose Cornell, an elderly man who sides with David's group. | Juan Gabriel Pareja as Morales | Ron Clinton Smith as Mr. Mackey, the store butcher. | Melissa McBride as Woman with Kids at Home.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Director Frank Darabont first read Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist in the Dark Forces anthology,[4] and originally expressed interest in directing a film adaptation for his directing debut. He instead filmed The Shawshank Redemption, also based on another King novella.[5] In October 1994, after completing The Shawshank Redemption, Darabont reiterated his interest in filming The Mist.[6] Darabont did not immediately follow through, instead directing the 1999 film adaptation of Stephen King's The Green Mile.[7] Darabont eventually set up a first look deal for The Mist with Paramount Pictures, having been entrusted feature film rights by Stephen King.[5] By December 2004, Darabont said that he had begun writing an adapted screenplay for The Mist,[8] and by October 2006, the project moved from Paramount to Dimension Films, with Darabont attached to direct and actor Thomas Jane in negotiations to join the cast.[5] | Director Darabont chose to film The Mist after filming the \"straighter dramas\" The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile because he \"wanted to make a very direct, muscular kind of film.\" Darabont conceived of a new ending in translating the novella for the big screen. Author King praised Darabont's new ending, describing it as one that would be unsettling for studios. King said, \"The ending is such a jolt—wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending.\"[10] | Darabont described The Mist as quaint in its elements of monsters and fear of the unknown compared to the contemporary popularity of films with torture porn. The director saw The Mist as a throwback to Paddy Chayefsky and William Shakespeare, explaining, \"It's people at each other.\" He highlighted the element of fear in the film in how it compelled people to behave differently. Darabont said, \"How primitive do people get? It's Lord of the Flies that happens to have some cool monsters in it.\"[4] He also drew parallels to The Twilight Zone episode \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\" and the 1944 film Lifeboat.[1] | In the novella, the character David Drayton - who is married - has a sexual encounter with Amanda Dumfries, who is also married. Darabont did not want to attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden respectively, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, \"We kind of form a little family, sort of surrogate family where my son and I’m a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We become a little unit as we’re trying to get through this nightmare together.\" Holden compared the nightmare to what refugees experienced at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.[11] | While the origin of the mist in the movie is never explained in great detail, Frank Darabont did write an opening scene in a draft dated 5 August 2005, in which the thunderstorm causes a malfunction at the Arrowhead Project's lab that allows the portal to another dimension to stay open too long. The scene was never filmed. | In December 2006, Jane finalized negotiations with the studio to join the cast.[12] In January 2007, actors Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden joined Jane for the cast of The Mist.[13] Production began the following February at StageWorks of Louisiana, a sound stage and movie production facility in Shreveport, Louisiana.[14] Marcia Gay Harden and Toby Jones joined the cast later in the month.[15] | William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Brian Libby, each of whom appeared in Darabont's previous Stephen King adaptations The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, were cast in supporting roles. Sadler had previously played Jane's role, David Drayton, in a 1986 audiobook version of The Mist. Darabont wanted to cast King in the supporting role that eventually went to Brian Libby, an offer that King turned down because he did not want to travel to film the part.[16] | Darabont sought to pursue \"a more fluid, ragged documentary kind of direction\" with The Mist,[11] so he contacted the camera crew from the TV series The Shield, after having directed one episode, to use their style in the film.[17] Darabont attempted to film The Mist digitally but found that it \"wound up looking too beautiful\". The director chose to film with 400 ASA from Fujifilm, which gave footage a grainy effect.[1] | In the opening shot, David is drawing in his room. The drawing is based on Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and was painted by movie poster designer Drew Struzan. Darabont also included re-productions of Struzan's posters and illustrations for The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Struzan would go on to produce a poster for The Mist, but this image was not used in the film's marketing campaign.[18] | Darabont collaborated with the production designer to create a mix of eras to avoid appearing as a period piece but also not looking so contemporary. Cell phones were used by characters in The Mist, but the military police in the film did not dress in modern attire. While an MP also drove an old Jeep instead of a Humvee, other cars seen in the film are modern models.[1] The city police cars in the beginning of the film are a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice and a 1988 Ford LTD Crown Victoria, cars that were standard police vehicles in the late 1980s but have not been used in force since the late 1990s. | Over a hundred extras from Shreveport, Louisiana were included in The Mist. Unlike conventional application of extras in the background of a film, sixty of the hundred extras were interwoven with the film's ensemble cast.[19] Additional elements giving the film a local flavor include the prominence of local Louisiana brands such as Zapp's potato chips. Exterior shots of the house at the beginning were in Shreveport. Exterior shots of the supermarket were in Vivian, Louisiana. Also, if looked closely at, the shields on the side of the passing firetrucks early in the film identify them as part of the Caddo Parish fire department. This is possibly a mistake as the film is allegedly set in Maine. | Darabont chose to use music to minimal effect in The Mist in order to capture the \"heavier feel\" of the darker ending he had written to replace the one from the novella. The director explained, \"Sometimes movie music feels false. I've always felt that silent can be scarier than loud, a whisper more frightening than a bang, and we wanted to create a balance. We kept music to a minimum to keep that vérité, documentary feel.\" Darabont chose to overlay the song \"The Host of Seraphim\" by the band Dead Can Dance, a spiritual piece characterized by wailing and chanting. As a fan of Dead Can Dance, Darabont thought that the song played \"as a requiem mass for the human race.\"[20] The original score was composed by Academy Award-nominated composer Mark Isham. | Darabont hired artists Jordu Schell[21] and Bernie Wrightson to assist in designing the creatures for the film.[17] Greg Nicotero worked on the film's creature design and make-up effects, while Everett Burrell served as the visual effects supervisor. Nicotero initially sketched out ideas for creature design when Darabont originally expressed interest in filming The Mist in the 1980s. When the project was greenlit, Nicotero, Burrell, and Darabont collaborated about the creature design at round-table meetings at CaféFX.[11] The studio for visual effects had been recommended to Darabont by Guillermo del Toro after Darabont asked the director who created the visual effects for Pan's Labyrinth. | Due to the creatures' being described in only a few sentences in the novella, Darabont sought to conceive of new designs. The challenge was creating designs that felt unique. Nicotero, who was versed in film history and genre history, reviewed past creature designs to avoid having similar designs.[1] When the designs were completed, Nicotero and Burrell educated the cast on the appearance of the creatures by showing puppets and the function of their eyes and mouths. The puppet demonstrations served as reference points for the cast, who had to respond to motion capture dots during filming.[11]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Mist  by Stephen King","m_directed_by":"Frank Darabont","m_produced_by":"Frank Darabont | Martin Shafer | Liz Glotzer","m_screenplay_by":"Frank Darabont","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Thomas Jane | Marcia Gay Harden | Laurie Holden | Jeffrey DeMunn | Andre Braugher | Samuel Witwer | Toby Jones","m_music_by":"Mark Isham","m_cinematography":"Rohn Schmidt","m_edited_by":"Hunter M.

The film was written and directed by Frank Darabont, who had previously adapted King's works The Shawshank Redemption (1994 film based on the 1982 novella) and The Green Mile (1999 film based on the 1996 novel). Darabont had been interested in adapting The Mist for the big screen since the 1980s. The film features an ensemble cast including Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Samuel Witwer, Toby Jones, and future The Walking Dead actors Jeffrey DeMunn, Juan Gabriel Pareja, Laurie Holden, and Melissa McBride. | Filming for The Mist began in Shreveport, Louisiana, in February, 2007. The film was commercially released in the United States and Canada on November 21, 2007; it performed well at the box office and received generally positive reviews. Darabont has since revealed that he had \"always had it in mind to shoot The Mist in black and white\", a decision inspired by such iconic films as Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the \"pre-color\" work of Ray Harryhausen. While the film's cinematic release was in color, the director has described the black and white print (released on Blu-ray in 2008) as his \"preferred version.\"[3] | The director revised the ending of the film to be darker than the novella's ending, a change to which King was amenable. Darabont also sought unique creature designs to differentiate them from his creatures in past films. | Although a monster movie, the central theme explores what ordinary people will be driven to do under extraordinary circumstances. The plot revolves around members of the small town of Bridgton, Maine who, after a severe thunderstorm causes the power to go out the night before, meet in a supermarket to pick up supplies. While they struggle to survive an unnatural mist which envelops the town and conceals vicious, otherworldly monsters, extreme tensions rise among the survivors. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e Edward Douglas (2007-11-16). \"An Exclusive Interview with Mr. Frank Darabont!\".
