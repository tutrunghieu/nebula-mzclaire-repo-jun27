{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Invisible War received widespread acclaim from critics.[28][29] At the end of 2012, it held a 100% Fresh rating from review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which also listed it as the #1 film of the year.[30] | The film appeared on numerous year-end best lists, including in The New York Times, Time, and the National Board of Review.[31][32][33] The Chicago Film Critics Association named it the Best Documentary of 2012.[34] | The Christian Science Monitor’s Peter Rainer observed that the film broke new ground, as it \"was the first to really explore the issue of rape in the military\" and that \"the fact that this subject has taken so long to achieve full-scale exposure was itself symptomatic of the problem.\" He selected it as one of the top ten films of the year.[35][36] | The Boston Globe’s Christopher Wallenberg noted that The Invisible War \"achieved a rare feat for a documentary by breaking a national news story: The alleged coverup of incidents of sexual assault and harassment at the prestigious Marine Barracks Washington.\" Other critics also focused on the film's investigative journalism,[37][38] including A. O. Scott, who wrote in The New York Times that Dick is \"one of the indispensable muckrakers of American cinema, zeroing in on frequently painful stories about how power functions in the absence or failure of accountability.\"[39] | Jonathan Hahn of The Los Angeles Review of Books said, \"There are some works of writing or painting, speech, or film that do more than just stand as great works of art. They change things. They put before us something fundamentally wrong with the world — with the society we take for granted, with the institutions on which we depend and that in turn depend on us — and demand change. The Invisible War belongs in that pantheon, and is easily one of the most important films of the year.\"[40] | Two survivors and one service provider who appear in \"The Invisible War\" criticized the filmmakers for their fleeting focus on male victims. Director Kirby Dick responded, saying that he is empathetic toward their concerns, but felt that focusing on women would serve as the best \"entry point\" for the discussion.[41]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Kirby Dick","m_produced_by":"Amy Ziering Tanner King Barklow","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Thaddeus Wadleigh Kirsten Johnson","m_edited_by":"Douglas Blush Derek Boonstra","m_production_company":"Chain Camera Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Cinedigm Docurama Films","m_release_dates":"January 20, 2012 (2012-01-20) (Sundance Film Festival) | June 22, 2012 (2012-06-22) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"97 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$71,968[1] | The Invisible War is a 2012 documentary film written and directed by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering and Tanner King Barklow about sexual assault in the United States military.
