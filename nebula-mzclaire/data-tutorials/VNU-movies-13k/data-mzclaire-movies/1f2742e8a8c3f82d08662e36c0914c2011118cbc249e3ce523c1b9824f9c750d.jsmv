{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"As the primarily white town of Delrona Beach, Florida, is preparing for its annual festival, one of the parade floats is set afire. A young black boy named Terrell is found guilty of the deed, and he is sentenced to community service with a local community theater. An orphan, Terrell is in the care of an elderly relative, Eunice Stokes, who lives in the neighboring, primarily black community of Lincoln Beach. | Eunice is being visited by her actress daughter, Desiree, a former beauty queen who left town while she was still in high school. At the time, she caused a scandal because she was pregnant by her boyfriend and her parents sent her to live with an aunt in Georgia until the baby came. She has returned to make amends to her mother and also to introduce her new husband, Reggie. While in town, she becomes reacquainted with her old high-school paramour, Flash, who was a star football player and is now a promoter for a property development scheme. | Back in Delrona Beach, Marly Temple runs a motel and cafe owned by her elderly father and drama-instructor mother. Marly feels shackled by the arrangement and is tempted to sell the hotel to developers, but she assumes her father will never agree. Marly wanted to be a marine biologist and was once an underwater performer, but when her twin older brothers died in an accident, she reluctantly became her father's heir. Marly must also deal with her former husband, Steve, a slacker who is always looking to make some quick money. Marly additionally has a boyfriend, Scotty, who is struggling to become a golf pro and travel the tour circuit. Marly then becomes romantically involved with Jack, a landscape architect affiliated with the property developers. | Offering commentary on the story are a group of golfers, who act as an updated iteration of the Greek chorus.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Sayles","m_produced_by":"Maggie Renzi","m_screenplay_by":"John Sayles","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Angela Bassett Edie Falco","m_music_by":"Mason Daring","m_cinematography":"Patrick Cady","m_edited_by":"John Sayles","m_production_company":"Anarchist's Convention Films","m_distributed_by":"Sony Pictures Classics","m_release_dates":"May 19, 2002 (2002-05-19) (Cannes Film Festival) | June 21, 2002 (2002-06-21) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"141 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$3,369,654[1] | Sunshine State is a 2002 American comedy–drama film written and directed by John Sayles.
