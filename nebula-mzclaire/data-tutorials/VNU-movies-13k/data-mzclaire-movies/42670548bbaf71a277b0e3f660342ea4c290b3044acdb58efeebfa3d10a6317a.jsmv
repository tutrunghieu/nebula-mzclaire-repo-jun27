He reaches a small village where he is assigned to live with a poor family with the task of recording local folk songs for use in the army later. He learns the hardships of peasant life and especially of that of a peasant girl named Cuiqiao. The story then focuses on the girl, who at only age 14 is forced to marry a significantly older man as her wedding dowry was used to pay for her mother's funeral and brother's engagement. The Communist soldier \"Brother Gu\" attempts to dissuade Cuiqiao from running off and joining the CCP, but recognizes her despair. After her marriage, Cuiqiao crosses the Yellow River at night but it is unclear whether she made it or not. The story then fast forwards to a rain dance being performed by the villagers, as the land has dried up and peoples' crops have died.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Richard James Havis, author of \"Changing the Face of Chinese Cinema: An Interview with Chen Kaige,\" said that the film \"immediately brought attention to\" the \"Fifth Generation\" of Chinese filmmakers.[2] The film's international premiere occurred in the 1985 Hong Kong International Film Festival.
