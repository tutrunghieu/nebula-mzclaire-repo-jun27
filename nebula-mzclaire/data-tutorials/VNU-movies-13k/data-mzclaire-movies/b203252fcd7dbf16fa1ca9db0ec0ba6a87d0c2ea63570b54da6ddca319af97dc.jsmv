Pennebaker requested permission from the Bill Clinton Campaign to film its progression. The Clinton Campaign agreed, and Pennebaker and Hegedus were allowed to film Communications Director George Stephanopoulos as well as Lead Strategist James Carville; they were given limited access to Bill Clinton. | At the start of filming, the film team was embedded with the Clinton Campaign in New Hampshire for that state's Democratic primary. During the onset of the campaign, the crew traveled around the state with the Bill Clinton Campaign. | After the surprise Clinton second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, the crew shot mostly in Little Rock, Arkansas, home to the Clinton campaign's national headquarters. As the film focused in on Carville and Stephanopoulos, the film crew saw no need to travel outside of Little Rock as both were present in the city for much if not all of the primary and general election campaigns.[citation needed] | Over a time span of four months filming, Pennebaker and Hegedus only shot about 35 hours of film.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Chris Hegedus | D.
