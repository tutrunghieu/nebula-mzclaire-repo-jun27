Mel Gibson later regretted that his portrayal of Tom Garvey was so stubborn that the audience lost sympathy, and said that he had been miscast for the role because he was too young and \"pretty\" at the time.","m_production":"Director Mark Rydell viewed the characters in this drama as iconically American, and he was eager to cast Sissy Spacek as the farm wife because of her performance in Coal Miner's Daughter and her home on a farm in near Charlottesville, Virginia. Rydell said, \"She is the consummate American rural young woman, with strength and fiber and a luminous quality.\" Mel Gibson begged Rydell to let him play the Tennessee farmer who reminded him of his father, but the director was reluctant because of Gibson’s Australian accent. Before Gibson left for England to film The Bounty, he begged Rydell not to cast the part yet. Rydell recalled, \"He came back to my house in Los Angeles and started reading the script, talking, reading the newspaper, in this perfect Tennessee accent. I was really impressed, even when he stood next to Sissy, who's like a tuning fork when it comes to accents, he had damn well done it.\" | The River was filmed in the Holston Valley area of Kingsport, Tennessee. The filmmakers purchased 440 acres (1.8 km2) along the Holston River for the farm set and planted corn. Most of the filming was done along Goshen Valley Road and around the Goshen Valley Park area. Goshen Valley Road heads south from highway 11W in Church Hill, Tennessee. The cast and their families moved to the area a month before the start of production to connect with the local people and learn farming skills. The floods in the film were supplied by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Army Corps of Engineers with water from the dam. The bank scene was filmed in the town of Gate City, Virginia. The film was completed for under $18 million.[1][2] | The musical score was by John Williams and also featured songs by country artists including George Strait.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mark Rydell","m_produced_by":"Robert Cortes Edward Lewis","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sissy Spacek | Mel Gibson | Scott Glenn","m_music_by":"John Williams","m_cinematography":"Vilmos Zsigmond","m_edited_by":"Sidney Levin","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 19, 1984","m_running_time":"122 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$18 million","m_box_office":"$11.5 million | The River is a 1984 film, directed by Mark Rydell, which tells the story of a struggling farm family in the Tennessee valley trying to keep its farm from going under in the face of bank foreclosures, floods, and other hard times.
