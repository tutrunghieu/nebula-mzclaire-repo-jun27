{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"While moving a train pulled by AWVR AC4400CW's #777 and #767 at the Veteran Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad (AWVR) trainyard in the fictional city of Fuller, Pennsylvania, the two hostlers, Dewey and Gilleece, take ill-advised shortcuts and accidentally allow the engine to leave the trainyard on its own power without the air brakes engaged. Initially believing the train to be a \"coaster\", yardmaster Connie Hooper orders Dewey, Gilleece, and chief welder Ned Oldham to drive and catch up the train to stop it. When Oldham finds that the train has already passed where it was supposed to be, they realize that the train is running on full power and now poses a dangerous threat. Dewey and Gilleece manage to catch up to 777 using a high-railing truck, but fail to board the train in time. Hooper alerts Oscar Galvin, director of operations for AWVR, as well instructs the local and state police and sheriffs to secure all the grade crossings to prevent injury. Visiting Federal Railroad Administration safety inspector Scott Werner finds that 8 cars being pulled by 777 contain molten phenol which would be a major disaster if the train should crash or derail in a populated area. News of the runaway train soon becomes a media event. | Hooper suggests they purposely derail the train, but Galvin disagrees and believes they can safely stop the train by lashing it behind two slower-moving diesel engines helmed by veteran engineer Judd Stewart, slowing it down long enough for AWVR employee and former U.S. Marine Ryan Scott to descent from helicopter to 777's cab and stop the train manually. Though the lashing initially works, 777 jumps ahead, knocking Scott out and derailing the two diesel engines, causing them to explode, which ultimately kills Stewart in the process. They realize that 777, traveling at its current speed, will certainly derail on \"Devil's Curve\", a tight, elevated portion of track in the middle of the city of Stanton on the eastern side of the state. Plans are made to purposely derail the train outside the town of Arklow using derailers. | Meanwhile, retiring AWVR engineer Frank Barnes and conductor Will Colson, a new hire looking to turn his life around after an incident with his now estranged wife, are pulling several cars with SD40-2 #1206 from Stanton. Though originally aware of 777 coasting away from the Fuller train yard, they are ordered at the last minute to pull into a Repair-In-Place track, making it just in time as 777 races by and clipping the last few cars they are pulling. Barnes observes that 777 has an open knuckle, which if they could catch up to the engine, they could use to couple to 777 and use their own brakes to slow the train before it reaches Stanton. As Colson unhitches their cars to give them the best chance of catching up, Barnes reports his plan to Hooper and Galvin and warns them that the derailing idea will not work given 777's momentum, but Galvin threatens to fire Barnes if he continues. Barnes ignores Galvin and sets 1206 on course to catch up with 777. As 777 passes Arklow, police attempt to shoot the fuel shutoff switch on the engine, but fail to hit it. As Barnes predicted, the train barrels through the derailers without slowing down. Hooper and Werner fully support Barnes' plan and take over control of the situation from Galvin. | Barnes and Colson catch up to 777 and manage to engage the coupling. Barnes attempts works his way across 777 to its cab while Colson engages 1206's dynamic brakes, which initially slow down 777, but would prove to be no match for 777's speed. They are able to reduce the speed slow enough to clear the Stanton Curve without derailing by using the independent brake, but 777 remains out of control and threatens to crash into the Stanton train yard. Barnes finds his path blocked to 777's cab, but Oldham arrives in his truck with a police convoy and drives on a parallel road to the tracks. Colson jumps to Oldham' truck, and Oldham drives him up to the front of 777 allowing Colson to get into the cab and engage the brakes. 777 is safely stopped before it reaches the end of the line. | Barnes, Colson, and Oldham are heralded as heroes, with Barnes retiring (with full benefits) and Colson reuniting with his wife and child. Hooper is promoted to Galvin's former position for her leadership, and Dewey goes into work into the fast food industry, indicating he was fired.","m_cast":"Denzel Washington as Frank Barnes, a veteran railroad engineer | Chris Pine as Will Colson, a young train conductor | Rosario Dawson as Connie Hooper, a train yardmaster | Lew Temple as Ned Oldham, a railroad lead welder | Ethan Suplee as Dewey, a hostler who accidentally instigates the disaster | Kevin Dunn as Oscar Galvin, vice-president of AWVR train operations | Kevin Corrigan as Scott Werner, an FRA inspector who helps Frank, Will, and Connie | Kevin Chapman as Bunny, a railroad operations dispatcher | T.

Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 86% based on 177 reviews, with an average score of 6.9/10. The film is \"Certified Fresh\", and the critical consensus is: \"As fast, loud, and relentless as the train at the center of the story, Unstoppable is perfect popcorn entertainment—and director Tony Scott's best movie in years.\"[6] Metacritic gives the film a score of 69% based on reviews from 32 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[7] | Film critic Roger Ebert rated the film three and a half stars out of four, remarking in his review, \"In terms of sheer craftsmanship, this is a superb film.\"[33] In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis praised the film's visual style, saying that Scott \"creates an unexpectedly rich world of chugging, rushing trains slicing across equally beautiful industrial and natural landscapes.\"[34] | The Globe and Mail in Toronto was more measured. While the movie's action scenes \"have the greasy punch of a three-minute heavy-metal guitar solo\", its critic felt the characters were weak. It called the film \"an opportunistic political allegory about an economy that's out of control and industries that are weakened by layoffs, under-staffing and corporate callousness.\"[35] | Unstoppable was expected to take in about the same amount of money as The Taking of Pelham 123, another Tony Scott film involving an out-of-control train starring Denzel Washington. Pelham took in $23.4 million during its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.[3] Unstoppable had a strong opening night on Friday November 12, 2010, coming in ahead of Megamind with a gross of $8.1 million. However, Megamind won the weekend, earning $30 million to Unstoppable 's $23.9 million.[36] Unstoppable performed slightly better than The Taking of Pelham 123 did in its opening weekend. As of April 2011, the film had earned $167,805,466 worldwide. [5][37] | The film was nominated in the Best Sound Editing (Mark Stoeckinger) category at the 83rd Academy Awards and nominated for Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Action.[38][39]","m_production":"Unstoppable suffered various production challenges before filming could commence, including casting, schedule, location and budgetary concerns.[8][9] | In June 2007, 20th Century Fox was in negotiations with Martin Campbell to direct the film,[10] and he was attached as director, until March 2009 when Tony Scott came on board as director.[11] In April, both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine were attached to the project.[12] | The original budget had been trimmed from $107 million to $100 million, but Fox wanted to reduce it to the low $90 million range, asking Scott to cut his salary from $9 million to $6 million and wanting Washington to shave $4 million off his $20 million fee.[13] Washington declined and, although attached since April,[14] formally withdrew from the project in July, citing lost patience with the film's lack of a start date.[9] Fox made a modified offer as enticement, and he returned to the project two weeks later.[14][15][16] | Production was headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the fictional railroad depicted in the movie, the \"Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad,\" is headquartered. Filming took place in a broad area around there including the Ohio cities of Martins Ferry, Bellaire, Mingo Junction, Steubenville and Brewster,[17] and in the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh,[18] Emporium, Milesburg, Tyrone, Julian, Unionville, Port Matilda, Bradford, Monaca, Eldred, Turtlepoint, Port Allegany and Carnegie,[19] and also in Portville and Olean, New York.[20] The Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad's Buffalo Line was used for two months during daylight, while the railroad ran its regular freight service at night.[21] The real-life bridge and elevated curve in the climactic scene is the B & O Railroad Viaduct in Bellaire, Ohio.[22] A two-day filming session took place at the Hooters restaurant in Wilkins Township, a Pittsburgh suburb, featuring 10 Hooters Girls from across the United States. Other interior scenes were shot at 31st Street Studios (then the Mogul Media Studios) on 31st Street in Pittsburgh. Filming began on August 31, 2009,[23] for a release on November 12, 2010. | Filming was delayed for one day when part of the train accidentally derailed on November 21, 2009.[24] | The locomotives used on the runaway train, 777 and trailing unit 767, were played by GE AC4400CWs leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway. CP #9777 and #9758 played 777 and 767 in early scenes, and CP #9782 and #9751 were given a damaged look for later scenes.[25] These four locomotives were repainted by Canadian Pacific in standard colors following the filming, but the painted pilot warning stripes from the AWVR livery were left untouched and remained visible on the locomotives.[26] The plow on 9777 appears to have been repainted black as of 2013.[27] | Most of the other locomotives seen in the film, including chase locomotive #1206, and the lashup locomotives used in an attempt to stop the train, #7375 and #7346, were played by EMD SD40-2s leased from the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. #1206 was played by three different SD40-2s: W&LE #6353 and #6534, and a third unit that was bought from scrap and modified for cab shots. Judd Stewart's lash-up locomotives #7375 and #7346 were played by W&LE #6352 and #6351, which also played two locomotive \"extras\" (#5624 and #5580), wearing the same grey livery with different running numbers.[25] The excursion train locomotive (#2002) was played by a Southwestern Pennsylvania Railroad Paducah-built EMD GP11 rebuilt from an EMD GP9. Passenger coaches carrying schoolchildren were provided by the Orrville Railroad Heritage Society.[28]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tony Scott","m_produced_by":"Julie Yorn | Tony Scott | Mimi Rogers | Eric McLeod | Alex Young","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Denzel Washington | Chris Pine | Rosario Dawson | Lew Temple | Ethan Suplee | Kevin Dunn","m_music_by":"Harry Gregson-Williams","m_cinematography":"Ben Seresin","m_edited_by":"Chris Lebenzon | Robert Duffy","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"October 26, 2010 (2010-10-26) (Westwood premiere) | November 12, 2010 (2010-11-12) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"98 minutes","m_country":"United States[2]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$85–$95 million[3][4]","m_box_office":"$167.8 million[5] | Unstoppable is a 2010 American disaster thriller film directed by Tony Scott, written by Mark Bomback, and starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine.
