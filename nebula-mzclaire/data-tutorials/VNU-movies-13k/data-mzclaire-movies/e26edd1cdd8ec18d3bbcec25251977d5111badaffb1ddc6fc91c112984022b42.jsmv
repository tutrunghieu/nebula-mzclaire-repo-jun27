{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Paleontologist Zack takes his nephew Ricky and niece Jade on a fossil hunt. While alone, Ricky is met by a talking rook, who turns into an Alexornis named Alex. He tells him of a story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of a Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. | Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of carnivores, led by a Gorgosaurus named Gorgon, attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family, with Gorgon personally killing Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. Gorgon's pack attacks them again; in the ensuing panic, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into the river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above. At a beach, Scowler follows a herd of Edmontosaurus to find food, callously leaving Patchi and Juniper behind. The two make their way through a forest and eventually are able to find their herd and Scowler. | After years of making the same migration from north to south and vice-versa, an adult Scowler becomes the herd's new leader, and forces Juniper to be his mate. Scowler recklessly leads the herd onto a thinly frozen pond, and Patchi is able to lead the majority of the herd to safety. Enraged and believing Patchi to be usurping him, Scowler goads Patchi into a battle for leadership of the herd. Scowler quickly wins and disowns Patchi, ordering the herd to leave him behind. Despondent and heartbroken, Patchi tries to allow predators to eat him, but Alex convinces him to die for something worth dying for as Bulldust did. | Reinvigorated by the advice, Patchi returns to the herd, only to find them under attack by Gorgon and his pack. As Gorgon overpowers him in battle, a repentant Scowler orders Patchi to save himself and lead the herd to safety. Instead, Patchi leads them in driving off Gorgon and his pack for good, saving Scowler. Scowler reconciles with Patchi and then concedes leadership of the herd to him, and Patchi goes on to have eggs with Juniper, one of which hatches and Alex asks for it to be named after him. In the present day, moved by Alex's story, Ricky returns the Gorgosaurus tooth to Ricky and Jade, who have unknowingly discovered Gorgon's skull.","m_cast":"Voiceovers for prehistoric creatures | Modern-day humans | In the film, the story of the dinosaurs is book-ended by live-action footage. Leguizamo, Long, Sircar, and Stone provide voiceovers for the computer-animated dinosaurs, while the book-end scenes star Urban as an uncle taking his nephew and niece, played by Rowe and Rice, to a dinosaur excavation site.[2] For the role of Alex, Leguizamo said he sought to conceal his own accent and create a unique voice for Alex.[3] He adopted a Spanish accent since parrots had a Latin American origin. He said, \"What was most difficult was finding the right pitch, because Alex is a small bird, but he's also the story’s narrator. So he also had to sound paternal and patriarchal.\"[4] Leguizamo compared his accent to that of Ricardo Montalbán, a Mexican actor.[5] Long said he was cast based on his voicing of the chipmunk Alvin in Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) and its sequels.[6]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Walking with Dinosaurs, named after BBC's 1999 television documentary miniseries, was produced by BBC Earth, an arm of BBC Worldwide that was launched in 2009. The feature film is directed by Barry Cook, who was a director for Mulan (1998) and the co-director for Arthur Christmas (2011), and by Neil Nightingale, creative director at BBC Earth.[8] The script was written by John Collee.[9] Nightingale and BBC Earth's managing director Amanda Hill sought to produce film adaptations to extend the arm's brand of nature programming. The two were inspired by returns for Deep Blue (2003) and Earth (2007), which were theatrical versions cut from their respective nature documentary series.[10] In June 2010, BBC Earth entered a deal with Evergreen Films, based in the United States, to produce a film featuring dinosaurs.[11] By the following November, BBC Earth entered a deal with Reliance Big Entertainment to finance the production of three films, including Walking with Dinosaurs. The deal had initially attached Pierre de Lespinois of Evergreen Films and Neil Nightingale to co-direct the film.[12] Barry Cook, who joined the film in March 2010,[13] eventually replaced de Lespinois as director.[8] | The total production budget was $80 million.[14] About 70% of the budget was covered when IM Global, a finance and sales company backed by Reliance, sold film rights to various distributors at the American Film Market in November 2010. The budget was further covered by tax breaks provided for filming in Alaska and in New Zealand. IM Global covered only 15% of the budget directly. Forbes called Walking with Dinosaurs an independent film with an unconventionally large budget since the production did not originate at a major studio.[15] Nightingale explained, \"It was originally funded by... Reliance, and then we sold it pretty quickly to 20th Century Fox for most of the world, and to a range of other distributors in a few other countries, and that's not an unusual path for an independent film — in other words, a non-studio film which doesn't originate from a big studio.\"[16] | The film features computer-animated creatures in live-action settings.[10] Live-action footage was filmed in New Zealand and in the southern part of the U.S. state of Alaska. Director Nightingale said, \"[They] have that kind of temperate climate which represents the period very well. The world was a bit warmer then, so they would have had 24 hours of sunshine in the summer and 24 hours of darkness in the winter.\"[17] Filming began in 2011 in Alaska, where Evergreen Films is headquartered.[18] In the second half of 2011, more than 55 people were working out of Evergreen's office in the Alaskan city of Anchorage.[19] While the film's dinosaurs lived in Alaska during the Late Cretaceous period approximately 70 million years ago, they lived more in the northern part of the state due to the climate at the time. Filmmakers considered Southeast Alaska's rainforests below the Arctic Circle close to the climate that the dinosaurs experienced, so they filmed there and in Southcentral Alaska. Specific locations included Crow Creek Mine near Girdwood, Alaska and the Kenai Peninsula.[20] In 2012, the state government of Alaska awarded the production companies a subsidy of US$1.7 million.[21] Additional filming also took place on South Island in New Zealand.[16] For a river chase scene, filming was performed at rapids in New Zealand using a helicopter and with a 3D camera rig in a rubber boat.[17] At the locations, the crew built dinosaur shapes out of PVC drain pipes to give the filmmakers a sense of the dinosaurs' scale when filming the live-action backdrop.[22] | Animation work was done by the Australia-based company Animal Logic, which joined the production in January 2011. Its involvement with the production created 140 jobs in New South Wales.[23] The company's animation director for Walking with Dinosaurs was Marco Marenghi, who had also worked on the BBC miniseries.[24] The company collaborated with animation producer Jinko Gotoh, who contributed to Finding Nemo (2003) and 9 (2009).[25] | Character designer David Krentz, who also worked on Disney Animation's Dinosaur (2000), designed about 20 creatures for the film and worked with 5-6 palaeontologists.[13] The characters were based on creatures found at fossil sites in Alaska and in Canada.[26] Krentz initially designed the creatures in pencil then modeled them with the software ZBrush to send to animators.[13] In addition, palaeontologists provided Animal Logic with technical drawings of dinosaur skeletons so animators could construct the skeletons virtually. The animators collaborated with the palaeontologists to validate the basic movements of the computer-animated dinosaurs. Software was used to overlay muscle to fit the movements. Animal Logic adapted the software Quill, which they used to animate penguin feathers in their work on Happy Feet (2006), into new software called RepTile to animate dinosaur skin and scales.[17] It also added feathers for some dinosaurs, including the Troodons and the Hesperonychus. The color palette and feather pattern of a golden pheasant was used for the appearance of the Hesperonychus.[27] The natural history unit archives were used to create a \"behaviour matrix\" that matched dinosaurs' anatomically correct gestures to their moods.[17] Animal Logic ultimately created 800 animated shots for the film, which director Cook said was a low number for an animated film.[13] | The 3D effects for the animation were achieved with the Fusion 3D system,[25] which was used for Avatar (2009), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), and live 3D sports broadcasts.[18] Cinematographer John Brooks worked with consultants and stereographers from the Cameron Pace Group to use a two-camera setup and capture film in 3D.[13] | Paul Leonard-Morgan composed the film score for Walking with Dinosaurs. He joined the production in July 2013. The German Film Orchestra Babelsberg performed the score at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany, where it was recorded. Engineer Rupert Coulson then mixed the score at AIR Studios in London, England. Leonard-Morgan then went to Los Angeles, California to dub the music for the film.[28] Leonard-Morgan's score was one of 114 original scores from feature films that were determined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to be eligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Score at the 86th Academy Awards,[29] though it was not nominated.[30] | In the film, actors provide voiceovers for the main creatures. Director Barry Cook said the original plan was for the film to be without dialogue or narration. He said, \"I think originally, we were looking at a film that could stand alone as a virtual silent movie... You can turn the soundtrack off and still get involved with the story and feel the emotions of the characters. In its final version, the movie has a narration and goes inside the heads of the animals, so you can hear what they're thinking.\"[13] Executives at 20th Century Fox, one of the film's main distributors, viewed a rough cut and thought the film needed voiceovers so children in the audience could connect to the characters.[31] | The film's character designer David Krentz said, \"Although the production veered away from being very realistic, the animation still plays independently. The powers that be decided to add narration and voice-over to reach a wider audience and the characters became slightly anthropomorphized to make them more attractive to younger kids.\"[13] Palaeontologist Steve Brusatte responded to The Scotsman's prompt about the \"danger of anthropomorphising\" the dinosaurs, \"The voiceovers are a bit of a compromise; the dinosaurs' lips aren't moving, they are not smiling and having human-like facial expressions or anything like that... They are only anthropomorphised to a small degree and that is necessary for a film like this.\"[22]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Neil Nightingale | Barry Cook","m_produced_by":"Mike Devlin | Luke Hetherington | Amanda Hill | Deepak Nayar","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Leguizamo | Justin Long | Tiya Sircar | Skyler Stone","m_music_by":"Paul Leonard-Morgan","m_cinematography":"John Brooks","m_edited_by":"John Carnochan | Jeremiah O'Driscoll","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"14 December 2013 (2013-12-14) (Dubai Int'l Film Festival) | 20 December 2013 (2013-12-20) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom[1] | United States[1] | Australia[1] | India[1]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$80 million","m_box_office":"$126.5 million | Walking with Dinosaurs is a 2013 British-American-Austrailan-Indian family film about dinosaurs set in the Late Cretaceous period, 70 million years ago. The production features computer-animated dinosaurs in live-action settings with actors John Leguizamo, Justin Long, Tiya Sircar, and Skyler Stone providing voiceovers for the main characters. It was directed by Neil Nightingale and Barry Cook from a screenplay by John Collee. | The film was produced by BBC Earth and Evergreen Films and was titled after BBC's 1999 television documentary miniseries of the same name. The film, with a budget of US$80 million, was one of the largest independent productions to date; it was financed by Reliance Big Entertainment and IM Global instead of a major studio. The majority of distribution rights were eventually sold to 20th Century Fox. The crew filmed footage on location in the U.S. state of Alaska and in New Zealand, which were chosen for their similarities to the dinosaurs' surroundings millions of years ago. Animal Logic designed computer-animated dinosaurs and added them to the live-action backdrop. Though the film was originally going to lack narration or dialogue, 20th Century Fox executives decided to add voiceovers, believing it would connect audiences to the characters. | Walking with Dinosaurs premiered on 14 December 2013 at the Dubai International Film Festival. It was released in cinemas in 2D and 3D on 20 December 2013. Critics commended the film's visual effects but found its storytelling to be subpar and derided the voiceovers as juvenile. The film grossed US$36.1 million in the United States and Canada and US$90.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of US$126.5 million. The Hollywood Reporter said the film's global box office performance was disappointing in context of the production budget and marketing costs. |  | ","m_marketing":"20th Century Fox marketed Walking with Dinosaurs in the territories where it distributed the film.[15] It also held a launch event at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in California.[36] The film is an extension of an existing franchise that started with the BBC miniseries and continued with an arena show that put animatronic dinosaurs on display. Since merchandising deals already existed, filmmakers easily began releasing merchandise for the film. Forbes said, \"There is already merchandise (toys, lunch boxes etc.) related to the movie which is normally unheard of for a first film.\"[15] Macmillan Children's Books (under Macmillan Publishers) acquired the license to publish tie-in books for the film in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. They published in November 2013 an encyclopaedic guide to the film's dinosaurs, a film handbook, and sticker books.[37] Travelgoods.com produced back to school merchandise based on the film, and Keldan International sold a hatching-egg toy for Christmas.[38] | Supermassive Games developed the Wonderbook game Walking with Dinosaurs for the PlayStation 3. The game was released on 13 November 2013.[39]","m_reference":"^ a b c d \"Walking with Dinosaurs (2013)\". British Film Institute. Archived from the original on 2015-09-14.
