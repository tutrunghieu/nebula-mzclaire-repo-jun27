{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The outlaw Butch Cavendish (Christopher Lloyd) ambushes a party of Texas Rangers, killing all except John Reid (Klinton Spilsbury) who is rescued by his old childhood Comanche friend, Tonto (Michael Horse). When he recovers from his wounds, he dedicates his life to fighting the crime that Cavendish represents. To this end, John becomes the great masked western hero, The Lone Ranger. With the help of Tonto, the pair go to rescue President Grant (Jason Robards) when Cavendish takes him hostage.","m_cast":"Klinton Spilsbury as John Reid/The Lone Ranger James Keach as John Reid/The Lone Ranger (voice, uncredited) | Michael Horse as Tonto[3] | Christopher Lloyd as Butch Cavendish[4] | Matt Clark as Sheriff Wiatt | Juanin Clay as Amy Striker | Jason Robards as Ulysses S.

Custer","m_reception":"The film was released to massive negative publicity fueled by the above controversy in 1981, and did poorly, grossing a mere $12 million against its $18 million budget. Other contributing factors were the lack of public interest in Westerns by the early 1980s as well as alterations to some fundamental elements of the Lone Ranger's character such as his trademark silver bullets being made into magical talismans in the movie instead of mere symbolism.[9] Lew Grade who invested in the movie had managed to sell it to TV for $7.5 million, and also to HBO.[10] | The film received generally mediocre reviews:[11] Time Out London said \"The mystery is how Fraker, a gifted cameraman who made a superb directing debut in Westerns with Monte Walsh, could produce such a clinker as this\",[12] while TV Guide proclaimed \"This film is so inept it's almost camp.\"[13] | Lew Grade later wrote he thought the problem was the movie took an hour and ten minutes for the Ranger to put on his mask. \"The mistake was not dispensing with the legend in ten minutes and getting on with the action much earlier on,\" he said.[10] | The film was nominated for, and won, several Golden Raspberry Awards: | Won: Worst Actor (Klinton Spilsbury)[14] | Won: Worst New Star (Klinton Spilsbury)[14] | Won: Worst Musical Score | Nominated: Worst Picture | Nominated: Worst \"Original\" Song (The Man in the Mask)","m_production":"Many attempts had been made to create a Lone Ranger movie that would appeal to a modern audience, including making Tonto an equal partner and mentor to the Lone Ranger. In the movie, Tonto teaches the hero how to shoot and is mainly responsible for training Silver, the hero's horse. Moreover, Tonto speaks whole sentences, while in the radio and TV series he had quite a limited vocabulary. In another change to established canon, Reid is (at first) not an actual Texas Ranger but a civilian observer (and younger brother of the Rangers' captain) who survives Cavendish's massacre.[citation needed] | This film was shot in New Mexico, Utah, and California. Two of the movie's four screenwriters, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, previously created the hit TV series Charlie's Angels; they also worked together on another hit series, Mannix. According to Larry McMurtry, novelist George MacDonald Fraser had written an excellent script for the film[5] though he is not credited in the finished film. | The movie's ballad-narration, The Man In The Mask, was performed by country music legend Merle Haggard, and composed by the legendary John Barry with lyrics by Dean Pitchford of Footloose and Sing fame. | Klinton Spilsbury's dialogue was overdubbed for the entire movie by actor James Keach.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"William A.
