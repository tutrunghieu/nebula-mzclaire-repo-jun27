{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the Lego universe, the wizard Vitruvius attempts to protect a super weapon called the \"Kragle\" from the evil Lord Business, but fails. He then prophesies that a person called \"the Special\" will find the Piece of Resistance, a brick capable of stopping the Kragle. | Eight-and-a-half years later, a construction worker named Emmet Brickowski comes across a woman named Wyldstyle, who is searching for something at Emmet's construction site after hours. When he investigates, Emmet falls into a hole and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences a vision and passes out. He awakens to find himself in the custody of Bad Cop, Business' lieutenant, and with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back. Emmet learns of Business' plans to freeze the world into perfection with the Kragle, a partially weathered tube of Krazy Glue. Wyldstyle rescues Emmet, believing him to be the Special, and takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Emmet learns that she and the wizard are \"Master Builders\"—people capable of building anything from their imagination without needing building instructions—who oppose Business. Though disappointed to find Emmet is not a Master Builder, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a seemingly human deity referred to as \"the Man Upstairs\". | Emmet, Wyldstyle, and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces temporarily, and escape with the aid of Batman. They go to Middle Zealand, which leads to the hidden \"Cloud Cuckoo Land\". There they attend a council of Master Builders, who are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack, having placed a tracking device on Emmet, and capture everyone except Emmet, Vitruvius, Wyldstyle, Batman, Benny (a Space Colony Lego figure), and Princess Unikitty, the ruler of now-destroyed Cloud Cuckoo Land. Escaping, they are picked up by the makeshift pirate Metal Beard. Emmet devises a team plan to infiltrate the office and disarm the Kragle, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where all the captured Master Builders make the instructions. Trying to retaliate, Vitruvius is decapitated by Lord Business, who sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop. As he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears as a ghost to Emmet and tells him that his belief makes him the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct's battery, Emmet seemingly dies by sacrificing himself to save his friends, by jumping into a void and severing the connection, causing the computer to shut down. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight Business' forces. | Emmet finds himself in the human world as a toy Lego man unable to move. The events of the story are being played out in a basement by a boy, Finn, on his father's Lego set. The father—\"the Man Upstairs\"—chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently glue and rebuild his perceived perfect creations together. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and has the power to change everything. Finn's father and Business have a change of heart, capping the Kragle and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and Wyldstyle becomes Emmet's girlfriend, with Batman's blessing. | As a result of the father allowing Finn's younger sister to join them in playing with his Lego sets, Duplo aliens beam down and announce plans of conquest.","m_cast":"Chris Pratt as Emmet Brickowski, an everyman and construction worker from Bricksburg who is mistaken for the Special, and is trained to be a Master Builder. | Will Ferrell as Lord Business, an evil businessman and tyrant of Bricksburg and the Lego Universe who is the company president of the Octan Corporation under the name President Business.[7][8] Ferrell also plays \"The Man Upstairs\", a Lego collector and Finn's father in the live-action part of the film. | Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle / Lucy, a \"tough as nails\" and tech-savvy fighter who is one of the Master Builders. | Will Arnett as Batman / Bruce Wayne, a DC Comics superhero who is a Master Builder, and Wyldstyle's temporary boyfriend. | Nick Offerman as Metal Beard, a giant makeshift pirate and Master Builder seeking revenge on Lord Business for taking his body parts following an earlier encounter, compelling him to build his current body from scratch.[8] | Alison Brie as Princess Unikitty, a unicorn-horned kitten and Master Builder that lives in Cloud Cuckoo Land, Middle Zealand.[8][9] | Charlie Day as Benny, a \"1980-something space guy\" who is one of the Master Builders and is obsessed with building spaceships.[7] | Liam Neeson as Bad Cop/Good Cop, a police officer with a two-sided head and a split personality who serves Lord Business as a member of the Super Secret Police.

The website's consensus reads, \"Boasting beautiful animation, a charming voice cast, laugh-a-minute gags, and a surprisingly thoughtful story, The Lego Movie is colorful fun for all ages.\"[40] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 83 (indicating \"universal acclaim\") based on 43 reviews.[41] According to CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, the average grade cinemagoers gave The Lego Movie was A on an A+ to F scale.[42] Filmmaker Edgar Wright and TIME Magazine film critic Richard Corliss each named The Lego Movie as one of their favorite films of 2014.[43][44] | Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Arriving at a time when feature animation was looking and feeling mighty anemic...The LEGO Movie shows 'em how it's done,\"[45] with Peter Debruge of Variety adding that Lord and Miller \"irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon.\"[46] Tom Huddleston of Time Out said, \"The script is witty, the satire surprisingly pointed, and the animation tactile and imaginative.\"[47] Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader said the filmmakers \"fill the script with delightfully absurd one-liners and sharp pop culture references\",[48] with A. O. Scott of The New York Times noting that, \"Pop-culture jokes ricochet off the heads of younger viewers to tickle the world-weary adults in the audience, with just enough sentimental goo applied at the end to unite the generations. Parents will dab their eyes while the kids roll theirs.\"[49] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News said the filmmakers \"don't sink into cynicism. Their computer animation embraces the retro look and feel of the toys to both ingenious and adorable effect.\"[50] | Claudia Puig of USA Today called the film \"a spirited romp through a world that looks distinctively familiar, and yet freshly inventive.\"[51] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail asked, \"Can a feature-length toy commercial also work as a decent kids’ movie? The bombast of the G.I. Joe and Transformers franchises might suggest no, but after an uninspired year for animated movies, The Lego Movie is a 3-D animated film that connects.\"[52] Joel Arnold of NPR acknowledged that the film \"may be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work—a cash grab with a heart.\"[53] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film \"sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding.\"[54] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post said that, \"While clearly filled with affection for—and marketing tie-ins to—the titular product that's front and center, it's also something of a sharp plastic brick flung in the eye of its corporate sponsor.\"[55] | On the negative side, Kyle Smith of the New York Post called the film \"more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long.\"[56] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times, while generally positive, found \"it falls apart a bit near the end.\"[57] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said the film \"will doubtless tickle young fans of the toys. It's just too bad that a movie that encourages you to think for yourself doesn't follow its own advice.\"[58] | Television personality, author, filmmaker, radio host and conservative political commentator Glenn Beck praised the film for avoiding \"the double meanings and adult humor I just hate.\"[59] | Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris referenced The Lego Movie not being nominated Best Animated Feature, which many critics considered a major snub, saying prior to the award's presentation \"If you’re at the Oscar party with the guys who directed 'The Lego Movie,' now would be a great time to distract them.\"[60] | The Lego Movie grossed $257.8 million in North America, and $210.3 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $468.1 million.[4] Calculating in all expenses, Deadline.com estimated that the film made a profit of $229 million.[61] | In North America, the film opened at number one in its first weekend with over $69 million, which was the second highest weekend debut in February, at the time, behind The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million).[62] The movie retained the top spot at box office in its second weekend by declining only 28% and grossing $49.8 million.[63] The Lego Movie was number one again in its third weekend while declining 37% and grossing $31.3 million.[64] In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number three grossing $20.8 million.[65] | Outside North America, The Lego Movie was released in 34 markets in February 7, 2014—the same weekend as its North American release. It made $18.7 million on its opening weekend from 5,695 screens from 34 countries.[66] On its opening weekend, which varies depending on the country, it earned $3.8 million Mexico, $2 million in Spain, $1.8 million in Brazil.[66] With a total gross of £34.3 million, it was the second highest grossing film in the UK and Ireland in 2014.[67] | The popularity of the film led to a shortage of Lego products by September 2014.[68]","m_production":"\"We wanted to make the film feel like the way you play, the way I remember playing. We wanted to make it feel as epic and ambitious and self-serious as a kid feels when they play with LEGO. We took something you could claim is the most cynical cash grab in cinematic history, basically a 90 minute LEGO commercial, and turned it into a celebration of creativity, fun and invention, in the spirit of just having a good time and how ridiculous it can look when you make things up. And we had fun doing it.'\" | Dan Lin conceived of the idea for the film and began discussing it with Roy Lee before leaving Warner Bros. to form his own production company, Lin Pictures, in 2008.[11] Meanwhile, Warner Bros. home entertainment executive Kevin Tsujihara had recognized the value of the Lego franchise by engineering the studio's purchase of Lego video game licensee Traveller's Tales in 2007, thought the success of the Lego-based video games indicated a Lego-based film was a good idea, and reportedly \"championed\" the development of the film.[11][12] By August 2009, Dan and Kevin Hageman were writing the script described as \"action adventure set in a Lego world.\"[13] Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were in talks in June 2010 to write and direct the film.[14] Warner Bros. green-lit the film by November 2011, with a planned 2014 release date. The Australian studio Animal Logic was contracted to provide the animation, which was expected to comprise 80% of the film. By this time Chris McKay, the director of Robot Chicken, had also joined Lord and Miller to co-direct.[15] McKay explained that his role was to supervise the production in Australia once Lord and Miller left to work on 22 Jump Street.[10] In March 2012, Lord and Miller revealed the film's working title, Lego: The Piece of Resistance, and a storyline.[16] In April 2012, Warner Bros. scheduled the film for release on February 28, 2014, a date that subsequently changed.[17] | By June 2012, Chris Pratt had been cast as the voice of Emmet, the lead Lego character, and Will Arnett voicing Lego Batman; the role of Lego Superman was offered to Channing Tatum.[18] By August 2012, Elizabeth Banks was hired to voice Lucy (later getting the alias \"Wyldstyle\")[7] and Morgan Freeman to voice Vitruvius, an old mystic.[18][19] In October 2012, Warner Bros. shifted the release date for the film, simply titled Lego, to February 7, 2014.[20] In November 2012, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson, and Nick Offerman signed on for roles. Brie voices Unikitty, a member of Emmet's team; Ferrell voices the antagonist President/Lord Business; Neeson voices Bad Cop; and Offerman voices Metal Beard,[21] a pirate seeking revenge on Business.[20] | In July 2012, a Lego-user contest announced on the film's Facebook page would choose a winning Lego vehicle to appear in the film.[22] Miller's childhood Space Village playset is utilized in the film.[23] | Animal Logic tried to make the film's animation replicate a stop motion film even if everything was done through computer graphics, with the animation rigs following the same articulation limits actual Lego figures have. The camera systems also tried to replicate live action cinematography, including different lenses and a Steadicam simulator. The scenery was projected through The Lego Group's own Lego Digital Designer, which as CG supervisor Aidan Sarsfield detailed, \"uses the official LEGO Brick Library and effectively simulates the connectivity of each of the bricks.\" The saved files were then converted to design and animate in Maya and XSI. At times the minifigures were even placed under microscopes to capture the seam lines, dirt and grime into the digital textures.[24] Benny the spaceman was based on the line of Lego space sets sold in the 1980s, and his design includes the broken helmet chin strap, a common defect of the space sets at that time.[25] | The film's total cost, including production, promotion and advertising (P&A), was $100 million.[26] Half of the film's cost was financed by Village Roadshow Pictures.[26] The rest was covered by Warner Bros., with RatPac-Dune Entertainment providing a smaller share as part of its multi-year financing agreement with Warner Bros.[27] Initially Warner Bros. turned down Village Roadshow Pictures when it asked to invest in the film.[26] However, Warner Bros. later changed its mind, reportedly due to lack of confidence in the film, initially offering to Village Roadshow Pictures 25% of the film, and later additional 25%.[26] | The film is dedicated to Kathleen Fleming, the former director of entertainment development of the Lego company, who died in an accident while vacationing in Cancun, Mexico in April 2013.[28]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Lego Construction Toys","m_directed_by":"Phil Lord Christopher Miller","m_produced_by":"Dan Lin | Roy Lee","m_screenplay_by":"Phil Lord | Christopher Miller","m_story_by":"Dan Hageman | Kevin Hageman | Phil Lord | Christopher Miller","m_starring":"Chris Pratt | Will Ferrell | Elizabeth Banks | Will Arnett | Nick Offerman | Alison Brie | Charlie Day | Liam Neeson | Morgan Freeman","m_music_by":"Mark Mothersbaugh","m_cinematography":"Pablo Plaisted","m_edited_by":"David Burrows | Chris McKay","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

Based on the Lego line of construction toys, the film stars the voice of Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman. It was the first film produced by Warner Animation Group in eleven years since Looney Tunes: Back in Action, which was released in 2003, and is an international co-production between the United States, Australia, and Denmark. The film tells the story of an ordinary Lego minifigure as he ends up becoming involved in a resistance against a tyrannical businessman who plans to glue everything in the Lego worlds. | The film was released theatrically on February 7, 2014 through Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures to near-unanimous acclaim with critics praising its visual style, humor, voice cast and heartwarming message, and it became a major commercial blockbuster, earning more than $257 million in North America and $210 million in other territories for a worldwide total of over $469 million. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \"Everything Is Awesome\". | The film quickly expanded into a franchise which ties to the Lego brand, with a sequel scheduled for release on February 8, 2019, with two spin-off films, The Lego Batman Movie and The Lego Ninjago Movie, to also be released in 2017, as well as a third in development currently. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Lego Movie (U)\".
