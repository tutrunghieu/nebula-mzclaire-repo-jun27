{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"About eight years after a zombie apocalypse, R, a zombie, spends his days wandering around an airport which is now filled with hordes of his fellow undead, including his best friend M. R and M achieve rudimentary communication with grunts and moans and occasional near-words. As a zombie, R constantly craves human flesh, especially brains, as he is able to \"feel alive\" through the victims' memories he experiences when he eats them. | While R and a pack of zombies are out hunting for food, they encounter Julie Grigio and a group of her friends, who were sent out by Julie's father from a heavily fortified, walled-off human enclave in a nearby city to recover medical supplies from abandoned buildings. R sees Julie and is drawn to her. After being shot in the chest by Julie's boyfriend, Perry, R kills him while Julie is distracted, and eats his brain, giving R his thoughts and memories, making his attraction to Julie even stronger. He rescues Julie from the rest of the pack by wiping some zombie blood on her face, masking her scent, and takes her back to an airplane he resides in at the airport to keep her safe. | Julie is initially terrified of R, and suspicious of his intentions. Julie starts to trust R after he rescues her during a failed escape attempt and finds her some food. R insists that Julie has to stay with him for a few days until he deems it safe enough for her to leave. The two bond, listening to LP records and playing games to kill the time, causing R to slowly begin to come to life.[9] After a few days, Julie gets restless, and tries to return home, yet attracts swarms of zombies, requiring R to rescue her. After fending off a group of zombies, including M, who is confused by R's actions, R decides it is time to return her to the human enclave. | On the way, R reveals to Julie that he was the one that killed Perry, which prompts her to abandon him and return to her home alone. R begins to make his way back to the airport, heartbroken. He then sees that M and other zombies are also beginning to show signs of life, making all of them targets for the Boneys – skeletal zombies who, having lost all traces of their humanity, have shed their flesh and prey on anything with a heartbeat. R and M lead a group to the human enclave, where R sneaks inside the wall. | There, he finds Julie and meets her friend Nora, who is initially shocked. When R reveals that the other corpses have also been coming back to life, the three of them attempt to tell Colonel Grigio, Julie's father and leader of the survivors. Colonel Grigio, however, refuses to believe corpses can change and threatens to kill R, stopping only when Nora pulls a gun on him. Julie and R escape to a baseball stadium where the rest of R's group is waiting, but soon find themselves under attack by a horde of Boneys. | While M and his gang of zombies square off against the Boneys, Julie and R run, but find themselves trapped. Taking the only escape route, R jumps with Julie into a pool far below, shielding her from the impact. After Julie pulls R from the bottom of the pool, they kiss. Colonel Grigio arrives and shoots R in the shoulder without warning. Julie attempts to persuade him that R has changed, when she notices that he is bleeding from his wound – revealing that he has completely revived and is human once more. The humans and zombies combine forces and kill most of the Boneys while the rest die off from starvation and the zombies slowly assimilate into human society. The film ends with a now fully alive R and Julie watching a wall surrounding the city being demolished, signifying the end of the apocalypse.","m_cast":"Nicholas Hoult as R | Teresa Palmer as Julie Grigio | Rob Corddry as M / Marcus, a friend of R | Dave Franco as Perry Kelvin, Julie's boyfriend | Analeigh Tipton as Nora, a friend of Julie | Cory Hardrict as Kevin | John Malkovich as Colonel Grigio, Julie's father and leader of the human survivors","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The studio Summit Entertainment backed the film,[10] which was produced by Bruna Papanadrea, David Hoberman, and Todd Lieberman and executive produced by Laurie Webb and Cori Shepherd Stern.[11] The zombies can barely talk in the film, so extensive voice-overs were used to express their thoughts.[12] | Writer and director Jonathan Levine said even though this is a love story that involves zombies, he hoped people would not try to put the film into one category and zombie enthusiasts would be open to a new twist on the genre. \"I think this movie takes the mythology in a different direction, and I think there is a lot there for die-hard zombie fans,\" he explained. \"We're encouraging people to be open-minded, because it does take some liberties with the mythology, but at the same time, it's very grounded in the science of zombie-ism and uses that as a springboard for a more fantastical story. It may be divisive, but I think there's a lot there for zombie fans if they're open-minded to a new take on it, and I hope they can.\"[13] Actress Teresa Palmer said, \"For me, the core of the story is that love breathes life back into people. That human connection saves us. People who have had those lights dimmed inside them, when they fall in love they get brighter.\"[14] | Warm Bodies began shooting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2011 with its airport scenes being shot at Montreal-Mirabel International Airport.[15] | Levine told USA Today that R attempts \"to do a lot of things to varying degrees of success. Driving, for instance. Let's just say his hand–eye coordination is not what it needs to be.\"[16] Nicholas Hoult and other zombie actors practiced with circus performers to achieve the right body moves.[7][17] Hoult explained, \"There were some days with the Cirque du Soleil people and we would take our shoes off in a dance studio and we would kind of grow out of the wall and make our bodies feel very heavy. It's one of those things where you think about it a lot but you just have to try it out and see what works. Then Jonathan [Levine] would say either 'too much or little less', we didn't want to go over the top with it.\"[17] Hoult told another reviewer that he \"drew a lot of his inspiration from Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands,\" saying he thought of that movie \"as a zombie film, whether it was or not. Because you had to feel sorry for Edward... I was thinking of Edward when I did R.\"[18]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Warm Bodies  by Isaac Marion","m_directed_by":"Jonathan Levine","m_produced_by":"David Hoberman Todd Lieberman Bruna Papandrea","m_screenplay_by":"Jonathan Levine","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer Rob Corddry Dave Franco Analeigh Tipton Cory Hardrict John Malkovich","m_music_by":"Marco Beltrami Buck Sanders","m_cinematography":"Javier Aguirresarobe","m_edited_by":"Nancy Richardson","m_production_company":"Mandeville Films","m_distributed_by":"Summit Entertainment","m_release_dates":"January 16, 2013 (2013-01-16) (Rome Premiere) | January 31, 2013 (2013-01-31) (Philippines Premiere) | February 1, 2013 (2013-02-01) (United States) |  | ","m_running_time":"97 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$35 million[2]","m_box_office":"$117 million[3] | Warm Bodies is a 2013 American paranormal romantic[4][5] zombie comedy film based on Isaac Marion's novel of the same name.
