{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Lucy Harmon, a 19-year-old American teenager, arrives in the lush Tuscan countryside to be sculpted by a family friend who lives in a beautiful villa there. Lucy visited there four years earlier and exchanged a kiss with an Italian boy with whom she hopes to become re-acquainted. Lucy's mother, who lived in the villa, had committed suicide recently and Lucy wants to explore her mother's past. Lucy also hopes to discover the identity of her father, who her mother hinted was a resident of the villa. Once there, Lucy meets and befriends a variety of eccentric locals who were companions of her mother, and begins to form relationships and connections with each of them, especially with Alex Parrish, an English writer who is dying from terminal cancer. | Lucy yearns to lose her virginity and becomes an object of intense interest to the men of the household, but the suitor she finally selects is not the initial object of her affection. After Alex is taken away to a local hospital - presumably going there to die - Lucy finally loses her virginity in the farm fields outside the villa.","m_cast":"Liv Tyler as Lucy Harmon | Joseph Fiennes as Christopher Fox | Jeremy Irons as Alex Parrish | Sinéad Cusack as Diana Grayson | Donal McCann as Ian Grayson | Rebecca Valpy as Daisy Grayson | Jean Marais as M.
