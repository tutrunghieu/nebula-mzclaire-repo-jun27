The supporting cast features Jane Wyman, Slim Pickens, Noah Beery, Jr., Steve Brodie, and Eddie Cantor. Bing Crosby secretly made a screen test for the lead role available for viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles but was deemed too different in persona from Rogers to play the part. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ 109 Million Techni Sked: Budgets for Pix: Warner, Variety 18 February 1948 p 14 | ^ 'Top Box-Office Hits of 1952', Variety, January 7, 1953","m_external_link":"The Story of Will Rogers at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/The_Story_of_Will_Rogers_VideoCover.jpeg/220px-The_Story_of_Will_Rogers_VideoCover.jpeg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
