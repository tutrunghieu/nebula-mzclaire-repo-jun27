{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is an adaptation of the novel The Master and Margarita by Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov. Three storylines are interwoven. The first is a satire of the 1930s, the period during which Joseph Stalin is in power in the Soviet Union. The devil Woland comes to Moscow to have his annual spring ball of the full moon. He and his companions challenge corrupt bureaucrats and profiteers. The second story, set in Jerusalem, describes the inner struggle of Pontius Pilate before, during, and after the conviction and execution of Jesus. The third part tells the love story between a nameless writer in Moscow in the 1930s and his lover, Margarita. He has written a novel on Pontius Pilate, a subject which was taboo in the officially atheistic Soviet Union.","m_cast":"Margarita: Anastasiya Vertinskaya | The Master: Viktor Rakov | Woland: Valentin Gaft | Ivan Bezdomny: Sergey Garmash | Pontius Pilate: Mikhail Ulyanov | Koroviev: Aleksandr Filippenko | Behemoth: Viktor Pavlov | Yeshua Ha-Nozri: Nikolai Burlyayev | Kaifa: Vyacheslav Shalevich | Azazello: Vladimir Steklov | Claudia Procula, Pontius Pilate's wife: Ekaterina Arkharova","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":null,"m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Anastasiya Vertinskaya Viktor Rakov Valentin Gaft Sergey Garmash Mikhail Ulyanov Aleksandr Filippenko Viktor Pavlov Nikolai Burlyayev Vyatsheslav Shalevich Vladimir Steklov","m_music_by":" Russia","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":"Website | The Master and Margarita (Мастер и Маргарита) is a Russian film made by director Yuri Kara, based on the novel The Master and Margarita by the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov. |  | ","m_country":null,"m_language":null,"m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"(Russian) Official website | (English) The Master and Margarita at the Internet Movie Database | (English) (French) (Dutch) (Russian) Master i Margarita (Yuri Kara) on the Master & Margarita website | Master's novel characters:","m_poster":"Russian","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Mikhail Bulgakov (Novel)"}
