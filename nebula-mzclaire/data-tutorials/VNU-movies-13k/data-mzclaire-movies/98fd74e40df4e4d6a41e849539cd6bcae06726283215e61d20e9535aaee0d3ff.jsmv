The film details the two activists' involvement in hoaxes targeting SimCopter, the 2000 G. W. Bush presidential campaign, McDonald's, and, most prominently, the WTO. The film also includes brief interviews with Michael Moore and Greg Palast. | The film premiered at the 28th Toronto International Film Festival in 2003. It was also shown as part of a special screening at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. The film received a score of 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is followed by a sequel, The Yes Men Fix the World.","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Yes Men website | The Yes Men at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/YESMEN-box_hires_dvd.jpg/190px-YESMEN-box_hires_dvd.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
