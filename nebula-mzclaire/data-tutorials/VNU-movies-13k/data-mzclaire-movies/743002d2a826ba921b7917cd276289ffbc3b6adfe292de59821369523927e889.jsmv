It is about an expedition made by freestyle mountain climber Reinhold Messner and his partner Hans Kammerlander to climb Gasherbrum II and Gasherbrum I all in one trip without returning to base camp. The film is not so much concerned with showing the climb itself or giving guidelines on mountaineering, but seeks to reveal the inner motivation of the climbers.","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Dark Glow of the Mountains at the Internet Movie Database | Senses of Cinema article on Dark Glow of the Mountains","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/Dark_glow.jpg/220px-Dark_glow.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Werner Herzog"}
