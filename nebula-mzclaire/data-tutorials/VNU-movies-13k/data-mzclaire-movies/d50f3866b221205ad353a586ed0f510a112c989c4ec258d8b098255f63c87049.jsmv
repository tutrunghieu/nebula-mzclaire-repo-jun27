{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jesse W. Haywood (Don Knotts) graduates from dental school in Philadelphia in 1870 and goes west to become a frontier dentist. As a \"city slicker\", he finds himself bungling in a new environment. | On his way west, the stagecoach is held up and robbed by two masked bandits. A posse catches one of them, Penelope \"Bad Penny\" Cushing (Barbara Rhoades). | Facing prison, Penelope is offered a pardon if she will track down a ring of gun smugglers that also involves a local Indian tribe. Because the wagon train she plans to accompany will not permit single women to join, she tricks Haywood into a sham marriage as a disguise. | Haywood inadvertently becomes the legendary \"Doc the Heywood\" after he guns down \"Arnold the Kid\" and performs other exploits (all with covert assistance from Penny). | There are a couple of scenes which parody similar scenes in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with John Wayne and James Stewart. The stage coach holdup scene is the first encounter that both city dudes have with the \"wild west\". In the gunfight scene, both \"dudes\" are about to be shot down in duels with experienced gunfighters when they are saved by one of the good guys who shoots the villain from a hidden position which makes the shooting look like the underdog winning a legitimate gunfight.","m_cast":"Don Knotts as Dr. Jesse W.
