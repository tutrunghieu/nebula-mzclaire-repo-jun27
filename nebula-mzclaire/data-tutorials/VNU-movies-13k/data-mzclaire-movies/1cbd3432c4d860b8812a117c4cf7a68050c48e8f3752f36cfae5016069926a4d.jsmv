{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Woody prepares to go to cowboy camp with Andy, but Andy nearly rips Woody's right arm off. Andy decides to leave Woody behind, and Andy's mother puts Woody on a shelf. The next day, Woody discovers Wheezy, a penguin squeaky toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy's other toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex all set out to rescue Woody. | At Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s[7] TV show called Woody's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the other toys from the show—Jessie, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Pete—are excited about going, Woody wants to return home because he is still one of Andy's toys. Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it since they will return to storage if he is absent from the collection. When his arm is torn off accidentally, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape but is foiled by someone mysteriously turning on Al's television set. The next morning, a cleaner repairs his arm and Woody learns that Jessie was once the beloved toy of a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. This convinces Woody to stay, now believing that all toys eventually get discarded by their owners. | Meanwhile, Buzz and the other toys eventually reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned into a cardboard box by another Buzz Lightyear action figure with a utility belt, who thinks he is a real space ranger, like the original Buzz from the first film. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him as their Buzz. After discovering Al's plan, they arrive at his apartment while Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who immediately goes after him, intent on destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody of a toy's \"true purpose\" and warns him that in the museum, he will only be able to watch children from behind glass and never be played with again. After seeing a boy play with him on the TV, Woody changes his mind and asks the Roundup toys to come with him, but Stinky Pete prevents their escape. | Having foiled Woody's escape the previous night, Stinky Pete reveals that he wants to go to Japan because he was never sold to children, allowing Al to take the Roundup toys with him. Buzz and the gang follow Al, but are caught by Zurg, who battles the new Buzz until Rex knocks him down Al's apartment. The new Buzz then chooses to remain behind with an injured Zurg. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, Andy's toys steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to an airport, where they enter the baggage handling system and free Woody. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm again while preventing his escape, but is stuffed into a little girl's Barbie backpack by Andy's toys to teach him a lesson of what it is like to be played with. They free Bullseye, only for Jessie to end up on the plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody frees Jessie and the toys find their way home. | When Andy returns from camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, thinking his mother bought them, and repairs Woody's torn arm. Meanwhile, Al's business has suffered due to his failure to sell the Roundup toys. Woody tells Buzz that he is not worried about Andy discarding him because, when he does, they will still have each other for company. Wheezy's squeaker has been fixed and he performs a Frank Sinatra-style version of \"You've Got a Friend in Me\".","m_cast":"Tom Hanks as Sheriff Woody | Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear | Joan Cusack as Jessie (Mary Kay Bergman as Jessie's yodeling voice) | Kelsey Grammer as Stinky Pete | Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head | Jim Varney as Slinky Dog | Wallace Shawn as Rex | John Ratzenberger as Hamm | Annie Potts as Bo Peep | Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head | Wayne Knight as Al McWhiggin | John Morris as Andy | Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom | R.

The film is No. 27 on Rotten Tomatoes' list of \"Best Rated Films\",[48] and is the third best rated animated film.[49] Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus with \"The rare sequel that arguably improves on its predecessor, Toy Story 2 uses inventive storytelling, gorgeous animation, and a talented cast to deliver another rich moviegoing experience for all ages.\"[50] The film also holds an 88/100 on Metacritic, indicating \"Universal acclaim\".[51] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.[52] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and said in his print review, \"I forgot something about toys a long time ago, and Toy Story 2 reminded me\".[53] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said \"Toy Story 2 may not have the most original title, but everything else about it is, well, mint in the box\".[54] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said \"It's a great, IQ-flattering entertainment both wonderful and wise\".[55] | The film was no less successful than its predecessor in a commercial perspective. It became 1999's highest-grossing animated film, earning $245 million domestically and $485 million worldwide—beating both of Pixar's previous releases by a significant margin.[3] It was the second highest-grossing animated film of all-time, behind Disney's The Lion King (1994).[6] Toy Story 2 opened over the Thanksgiving Day weekend at No. 1 to a three-day tally of $57,388,839 from 3,236 theaters, averaging $17,734 per theater over three days, making $80,102,784 since its Wednesday launch, and staying at No. 1 for the next two weekends.[56] By New Year's Day, it had made more than $200 million in the U.S. alone, and it eventually made $245,852,179 domestically and $239,163,000 overseas for a total worldwide gross of $485,015,179, becoming 1999's third highest grossing film, and far surpassing the original.[57] | Toy Story 2 received several recognitions, including seven Annie Awards, but none of them were previous nominations.[58] The first went to Pixar for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Theatrical Feature.[58] The Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production award was given to John Lasseter, Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon.[58] Randy Newman won an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Music in an Animated Feature Production.[58] Joan Cusack won the Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Feature Production,[58] while Tim Allen for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an animated feature Production.[58] The last Annie was received by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Ash Brannon, Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin and Chris Webb for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Feature Production.[58] | The film itself also won many awards, including the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Family Film (Internet Only), the Critics Choice Award for Best Animated Film, the Bogey Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[58] Along with his other awards, Randy Newman and his song \"When She Loved Me\" won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.[59] A Satellite Award was given for Outstanding Youth DVD, and a Golden Satellite Award for Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media, and one for Best Original Song \"When She Loved Me\".[58] | AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains: Buzz Lightyear – Nominated Hero[71] | AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs: \"When She Loved Me\" – Nominated[72] | AFI's 10 Top 10 – Nominated Animated Film[73]","m_production":"Talk of a sequel to Toy Story began around a month after the film's opening, in December 1995.[8] A few days after the original film's release, Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Woody doll at an airport. Lasseter described how the boy's excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply. Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. The memory was a defining factor in the production of Toy Story 2, with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.[9] | Ed Catmull, Lasseter, and Ralph Guggenheim visited Joe Roth, successor to recently ousted Jeffrey Katzenberg as chairman of Walt Disney Studios, shortly afterward. Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel.[8] Disney had recently begun making direct-to-video sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the Toy Story sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994's Aladdin sequel, The Return of Jafar, had returned an estimated $100 million in profits.[10] | Initially, everything regarding the sequel was uncertain at first: whether stars Tom Hanks and Tim Allen would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at Pixar or traditionally at Walt Disney Feature Animation.[10] Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects (Andrew Stanton in A Bug's Life and Pete Docter in early development work for a film that would eventually become Monsters, Inc.). Instead, Lasseter turned to Ash Brannon, a young directing animator on Toy Story whose work he admired. Brannon, a CalArts graduate, joined the Toy Story team in 1993.[10] Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.[11] | Lasseter's intention with a sequel was to respect the original film and create that world again.[9] The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy.[10] Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact.[13] The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of A Tin Toy Christmas, an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin, who had appeared in a draft of Toy Story but was later expunged, was inserted into the film.[10] Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.[12] | Secondary characters in Woody's set were inspired by 1950s cowboy shows for children, such as Howdy Doody and Hopalong Cassidy.[13] The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter's wife Nancy, who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep.[13] The scope for the original Toy Story was basic and only extended over two residential homes, whereas Toy Story 2 has been described by Unkrich as something \"all over the map\".[9] | To make the project ready for theaters, Lasseter would need to add 12 minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since it could not be mere padding—it would have to feel as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film.[4] With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. There, he hosted what he called a \"story summit\", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days. | Back at the office that Monday, Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of Toy Story 2 from exposition to resolution.[4] Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first Toy Story. The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening Toy Story 2.[14] A deleted scene from Toy Story, featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody's fear of losing Andy. The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of Toy Story.[14] | As the story approached the production stage in early 1997, it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on A Bug's Life for a 1998 release. The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful CD-ROM titles the previous year — The Toy Story Animated StoryBook and The Toy Story Activity Center.[13] Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in Toy Story itself. Steve Jobs made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the Toy Story 2 production team.[11] | Before the switch from direct-to-video to feature film, the Toy Story 2 crew had been on its own, placed in a new building that was well-separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks. \"We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox,\" co-producer Karen Jackson said.[4] Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. The film reused digital elements from Toy Story but, true to the company's \"prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of Toy Story than might be expected\".[15] Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short Geri's Game, who became the Cleaner in Toy Story 2.[15] Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.[16] | Whilst producing Toy Story, the crew was careful in creating new locations, working within available technology at that time. By production on Toy Story 2, technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film.[9] In making the sequel, the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film's look, but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed.[16] To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf, the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust, an incredibly difficult task. After much experimentation, a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf. Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film.[17] | Disney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer, and Pixar complied. As a result, Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin, associate producers, moved up into the roles of co-producers.[19] Lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with A Bug's Life until it wrapped in the fall. Once available, he took over directing duties and added Lee Unkrich as co-director. Unkrich, also fresh from supervising editor duties on A Bug's Life, would focus on layout and cinematography, while Brannon would be credited as co-director.[20] | In November 1997, Disney executives Roth and Peter Schneider viewed the film's story reels, with some finished animation, in a screening room at Pixar. They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing Toy Story 2 in theaters.[19] In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew. After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for Toy Story 2 would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal—but Toy Story 2 would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.[20] | The work done on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of the animators, while routinely clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs was one of the first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.[21][22] | Many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Lasseter, upon returning from the European promotion of A Bug's Life, watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.[5] | Unkrich, concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining, asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back. Jobs explained that there was no choice, presumably in reference to the film's licensees and marketing partners, who were getting toys and promotions ready.[4] Brannon focused on development, story and animation, Lasseter was in charge of art, modeling and lighting, and Unkrich oversaw editorial and layout. Since they met daily to discuss their progress with each other (they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in the same direction), the boundaries of their responsibilities overlapped.[16] | As was common with Pixar features, the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying.[18] While hard work and long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators,[18] and repetitive strain injuries for others.[23] Catmull would later disclose that \"a full third of the staff\" ended up with some form of RSI by the time the film was finished.[24] Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees.[18] In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby in the back seat of his car in the parking lot. \"Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard,\" wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.[25]","m_sequel":"A sequel, Toy Story 3, was released on June 18, 2010.","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Lasseter","m_produced_by":"Helene Plotkin | Karen Robert Jackson","m_screenplay_by":"Andrew Stanton | Rita Hsiao | Doug Chamberlin | Chris Webb","m_story_by":"John Lasseter | Pete Docter | Ash Brannon | Andrew Stanton","m_starring":"Tom Hanks | Tim Allen","m_music_by":"Randy Newman","m_cinematography":"Sharon Calahan","m_edited_by":"Edie Bleiman | David Ian Salter | Lee Unkrich","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures Distribution","m_release_dates":"November 13, 1999 (1999-11-13) (El Capitan Theatre)[1] | November 24, 1999 (1999-11-24) (North America) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"95 minutes[2]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$90 million[3]","m_box_office":"$485 million[3] | Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer-animated comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon, it is the sequel to the 1995 film Toy Story. | In the film, Woody is stolen by a toy collector, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him, but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum. Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story return for this sequel, and several new characters—including Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson), Stinky Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Estelle Harris)—are introduced. | Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct-to-video sequel. Toy Story 2 began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.[4][5] | Despite production struggles, Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $485 million, and received universal acclaim from critics. Toy Story 2 has been considered by critics to be one of the few sequels to outshine the original,[6] and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. Toy Story 3 was released in 2010, which was also critically and commercially successful. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Bell, Carrie (November 26, 1999). \"'Toy Story 2': The Premiere\".
