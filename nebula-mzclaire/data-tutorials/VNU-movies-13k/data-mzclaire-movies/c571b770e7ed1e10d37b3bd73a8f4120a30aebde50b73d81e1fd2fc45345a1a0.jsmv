{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Taking place in Georgia between winter 1909 and autumn 1937, the film explores the life of an ordinary African American woman named Celie Harris, whose abuse begins when she is young. By the time she is fourteen, she has had one child by her father, Alphonso \"James\" Harris, and is pregnant with another. He takes them away from her at childbirth and forces the young Celie to marry Albert Johnson, a rich, young widower who is only known to her as \"Mister\" and who treats her like a mute servant. He beats and rapes her often, intimidating Celie into submission and near silence. Celie's sister Nettie comes to live with them after running away from home, and there is a brief period of happiness as the sisters spend time together and Nettie begins to teach Celie how to read. This is short-lived; after unsuccessfully attempting to rape Nettie, Albert becomes angered and he kicks her out. Before being run off, Nettie promises to write to Celie. | Celie also finds strength in Sofia, a fiery and confident woman who marries Albert's son Harpo. Harpo confides in his father that Sofia is hard to control. Albert tells Harpo he should beat her, so he can control her. He asks the same question of Celie. Celie, afraid of what Albert may do if she says otherwise, says to beat her too. Years later, Sofia decides to leave. Celie begins to lose hope that her sister has long gone as no letters appear for her at the letter box. | Years later during a storm, Albert's old sweetheart, jazz singer Shug Avery, comes to live with him and Celie. Shug and Celie eventually become close friends. Shug confides in Celie about her difficult relationship with her father, a local pastor. Harpo builds a Juke Joint, a small bar with Shug singing the opening night. It proves to be a popular places for townsmen and does well. However, Shug's pastor father condemns the juke joint. Harpo's new girlfriend Squeak gets into a fight with Sofia, and a fight breaks out in the bar. Shug tries to reconcile with her father the pastor but is unsuccessful and decides to leave. Celie attempts to run away with her, but fear stops her. | One day, during a walk in town, Sofia's high-spiritedness proves to be her downfall, as a rude remark to the town mayor's wife \"Miss Millie\" and a retaliatory punch to the mayor himself ends with Sofia beaten and jailed for eight years. After her jailtime, Sofia ends up being the mayor's wife's maid. Sofia is shown to be prematurely aged and permanently disfigured due to the severe beatings she received in jail and demoralized into an almost catatonic state. Before Christmas Day, Miss Millie offers to drive Sofia back home to celebrate the holidays for the afternoon, but this is short-lived when Miss Millie gets frantic by the family members and wants to leave. | During a visit for Easter from Shug and her new husband Grady, Celie and Shug discover many years' worth of Nettie's correspondence. During all this time, Nettie has been living with the couple who adopted Celie's two children, now missionaries in Africa, and writing frequently to Celie - however, Celie is unaware of the correspondence, as Albert has confiscated the letters, collecting them under a loose floorboard. Reading the experiences written of Africa written in the letters and the assurance that she is still alive gives Celie hope that they may see each other again. She reads that Nettie is attempting to gain immigration status but is unable to come home yet. | Celie finally asserts herself, excoriating Albert and his father's years of abuse of her. Shug informs Albert that she and Grady are leaving and that Celie is coming with them. Harpo's girlfriend Squeak declares she is going with them as well. Despite Albert's attempts to verbally abuse Celie into submission, she stands up to him by mentioning that he kept Nettie away from her because Nettie was the only one who really loved her. As Shug, Grady, Squeak, and Celie go to the car, Albert readies to beat Celie, but she curses him and they leave. | In Tennessee, Celie opens a successful haberdashery. Meanwhile, Albert is feeling the effects of Celie's words. It is fall 1937, and his farm and land have become overgrown. Upon the death of her father, Celie learns that he was, in fact, her stepfather, and that she has inherited her childhood home, the farm, and a shop from her real father. She opens her second slacks shop, naming it Miss Celie's Folks Pants, while Harpo and Sofia reconcile during some fittings with Celie. While performing at the juke joint, Shug leads patrons from the juke joint to the church. She begins to sing powerfully and approaches her father. He is moved and embraces her while the whole church rejoices. | Celie receives a letter from the immigration office. Albert has arranged for Nettie, her husband, and Celie's two children and daughter-in-law to come back to America from Africa. Celie's children, Adam and Olivia, rejoice as they are reunited with her at Celie's farm. Albert looks on from a distance, and Shug smiles at him because he finally did the right thing. Nettie and Celie play their childhood clapping game as the sun sets.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Color Purple  by Alice Walker","m_directed_by":"Steven Spielberg","m_produced_by":"Quincy Jones | Kathleen Kennedy | Frank Marshall | Steven Spielberg","m_screenplay_by":"Menno Meyjes","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Danny Glover | Adolph Caesar | Margaret Avery | Rae Dawn Chong | Whoopi Goldberg","m_music_by":"Quincy Jones","m_cinematography":"Allen Daviau","m_edited_by":"Michael Kahn","m_production_company":"Amblin Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.
