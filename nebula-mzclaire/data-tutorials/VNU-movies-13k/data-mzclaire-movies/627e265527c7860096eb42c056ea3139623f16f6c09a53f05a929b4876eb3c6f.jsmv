As Jack Regan himself puts it after the first raid in the film: \"I've never seen so many dead people\". Armed with gold-plated Purdey shotguns, they evade Regan and the Flying Squad for quite some time, before Regan finds encouragement from his former Detective Chief Superintendent who was sent down for corruption because Jack wouldn't testify in court for him.[1]","m_cast":"John Thaw as Detective Inspector Jack Regan | Dennis Waterman as Detective Sergeant George Carter | Denholm Elliott as ex-Detective Chief Superintendent Jupp | Ken Hutchison as Hill | Anna Gaël as Mrs. Hill | Lewis Fiander as Gorran | Nigel Hawthorne as Detective Chief Inspector Dilke | Barry Stanton as Big John | John Flanagan as Willard | David Casey as Goodyear | Derrick O'Connor as Llewelyn | Frederick Treves as McKyle | John Alkin as Dectective Sergeant Tom Daniels | James Warrior as Detective Constable Jellyneck","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tom Clegg","m_produced_by":"Ted Childs","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Thaw Dennis Waterman Denholm Elliott","m_music_by":"Tony Hatch","m_cinematography":"Dusty Miller","m_edited_by":"Chris Burt","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"EMI","m_release_dates":"April 1978 (1978-04) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | Sweeney 2 is a 1978 film made following the success of the 1977 film Sweeney! which was a spin-off from the popular British TV show The Sweeney.
