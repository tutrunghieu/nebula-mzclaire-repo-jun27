Screenwriters Edward Taylor, David Aaron Cohen, and Nick Thiel adapted only one of Sara Paretsky's novels, Deadlock, for the script, which took at least one liberty with the story. Whereas Paretsky had written the novel as a serious mystery, the screenwriters took an almost comedic approach. Paretsky was especially angry over the original script that had the independent female detective subordinate to a male counterpart for fear that a female character could not hold the lead role. | Initially, the producers wanted to set the film in Baltimore and cast either Amy Madigan, Bette Midler or Jane Fonda as Warshawski. | Kathleen Turner reprised her character V.I. Warshawski in a series of radio plays on BBC Radio 4. | Principal production began in Chicago in November 1990. Scenes were filmed at Wrigley Field, Chicago; Green Mill - 4802 N. Broadway Avenue, Chicago, (used as the Golden Glow Cocktail Lounge); San Pedro, California, Long Beach, California; Fire Station 23 - 225 E. 5th Street, Los Angeles, and Warner Bros Studios. Completed shooting February 27, 1991. | The film was released on VHS on November 13, 1991; it was released on Laserdisc (4:3 ratio) the following year and on DVD on June 4, 2002 (in a 1.85:1 ratio). It was released on Blu-ray in May 2011.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Deadlock by Sara Paretsky","m_directed_by":"Jeff Kanew","m_produced_by":"Penney Finkelman Cox Jeffrey Lurie","m_screenplay_by":"Edward Taylor David Aaron Cohen Nick Thiel","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Kathleen Turner | Jay O.
