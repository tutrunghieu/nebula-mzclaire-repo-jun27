{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her Broadway musical debut. A meteorite lands near Central Park, and an extraterrestrial symbiote attaches itself to Peter's moped. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped prisoner Flint Marko, who falls into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand and allows him to shapeshift at will as the Sandman. Harry Osborn attacks Peter with new weapons based on his father's Green Goblin technology, leading to partial amnesia, which makes him forget his revenge. | During a festival honoring Spider-Man, Marko robs an armored car. NYPD Captain George Stacy tells Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's killer, and the deceased Dennis Carradine was only Marko's accomplice. While a vengeance-obsessed Peter sleeps, the symbiote bonds with him. Peter wakes up hanging from a skyscraper and discovers his costume has changed and his powers have been enhanced, but the symbiote brings out Peter's dark side. Wearing the new black suit, Spider-Man locates Marko—spiting his Daily Bugle competitor Eddie Brock by breaking his camera—and battles him in a subway tunnel. He discovers water is Marko's weakness and breaks a water pipe to reduce the Sandman into mud, washing Marko away into the pipes, Spider-Man leaving him for dead. | Peter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering, and she finds solace with Harry. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his dead father, compels Mary Jane to break up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves somebody else, Harry meets with Peter and claims to be \"the other guy\". Later, Peter, wearing the black suit, confronts Harry and spitefully tells him his father never loved him. Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face. | Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes Eddie Brock, a rival photographer at The Daily Bugle, by showing that he submitted doctored photographs showing Spider-Man as a criminal. Furious at having to print a retraction, J. Jonah Jameson sacks Brock. Soon afterwards, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Stacy's daughter, Gwen to the nightclub where Mary Jane works. Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally attacking Mary Jane, he realizes the symbiote is changing him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit but that the symbiote weakens when the bell rings. Peter removes the symbiote and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who is praying for Peter's death. The symbiote bonds to Brock's body, transforming him into Venom. Brock then finds Sandman and offers to join forces. | Brock hijacks Mary Jane's taxi and hangs it from a web hundreds of feet above a sand-filled construction site. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles with Brock, Harry learns the truth about his father's death and goes to help Peter. Harry subdues the Sandman, while Peter battles Brock. Brock almost impales Peter with Harry's glider but Harry jumps in the way and becomes impaled himself. Fighting the symbiote, Peter remembers how the church bell weakened it. He grabs pipes and creates a ring around the symbiote, creating a wall of sonic vibrations. The symbiote releases Brock, and Peter uses his webs to pull Brock from it. However, the symbiote has gained enough power from Peter and Brock to live on its own without a host. Peter throws a pumpkin bomb at the symbiote from Harry's glider, but Brock jumps in to save it, and both are killed by the explosion. | After the battle, Marko explains to Peter that he never intended to kill Ben, but only wanted his car and shot him accidentally when Dennis grabbed his arm, and that Ben's death has haunted him ever since. Peter forgives Marko, who dissipates and floats away. Peter and Harry forgive each other, and Harry dies with Mary Jane and Peter at his side. Later at the nightclub, Peter and Mary Jane dance, reconciling their relationship.","m_cast":"Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man: a brilliant physics student at Columbia University and photographer for the Daily Bugle who gets spider-like abilities from a radioactive spider and uses them to take up the persona of a spider-based vigilante protecting New York City from its criminal underworld. | Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson: a Broadway actress and Peter's childhood girlfriend. | James Franco as Harry Osborn / New Goblin: the dedicated son of Norman Osborn and Peter's estranged best friend, who believes Spider-Man murdered his father, but after learning Peter is Spider-Man and his father was the Green Goblin, he tends to battle Peter directly as a psychopathic assassin armed with the same equipment as his father. | Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman: a small-time thug with an estranged wife and sick daughter, whose struggle to rob for money to get his daughter treatment lures him into a freak accident that alters him into a master sand manipulator hunted by Spider-Man since he was Peter's uncle Ben's true killer. | Topher Grace as Eddie Brock / Venom: a rival Daily Bugle photographer who is exposed by Peter for creating a fake image of Spider-Man, and is ready for revenge when he bonds with the symbiote, turning him into monstrous being with the same spider-like powers. | Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy: Peter's lab partner and good friend, who is saved by Spider-Man from falling to her death. | Rosemary Harris as May Parker: Peter's aunt, who gives her nephew her engagement ring so he can propose to Mary Jane, and teaches him forgiveness. | J.

One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio.[4][5] Composer Christopher Young appears in the film as a pianist at Mary Jane's theater when she is fired, while producer Grant Curtis has a cameo as the driver of an armored car that the Sandman attacks.[6]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"\"The most important thing Peter right now has to learn is that this whole concept of him as the avenger or him as the hero, he wears this red and blue outfit, with each criminal he brings to justice he's trying to pay down this debt of guilt he feels about the death of Uncle Ben. He considers himself a hero and a sinless person versus these villains that he nabs. We felt it would be a great thing for him to learn a little less black and white view of life and that he's not above these people.\" | In March 2004, with Spider-Man 2 being released the coming June, Marvel Studios had begun developing Spider-Man 3 for a release in 2007.[8] By the release of Spider-Man 2, a release date for Spider-Man 3 had been set for May 2, 2007 before production on the sequel had begun.[9] The date was later changed to May 4, 2007. In January 2005, Sony Pictures Entertainment completed a seven-figure deal with screenwriter Alvin Sargent, who had penned Spider-Man 2, to work on Spider-Man 3 with an option to write a fourth film.[10] | Immediately after Spider-Man 2's release, Ivan Raimi wrote a treatment over two months,[11] with Sam Raimi deciding to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a sinless vigilante, and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals.[7] Harry Osborn was brought back as Raimi wanted to conclude his storyline.[7] Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father's legacy, but be instead \"somewhere between.\"[12] Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character.[7] While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben's killer to increase Peter's guilt over his death[13] and challenge his simplistic perception of the event.[7] Overall, Raimi described the film as being about Peter, Mary Jane, Harry, and the Sandman,[14] with Peter's journey being one of forgiveness.[15] | Raimi wanted another villain, and Ben Kingsley was involved in negotiations to play the Vulture before the character was cut.[11] Producer Avi Arad convinced Raimi to include Venom, a character whose perceived \"lack of humanity\" had initially been criticized by Sam Raimi.[16] Venom's alter-ego, Eddie Brock, already had a minor role in the script.[17] Arad told the director that Venom had a strong fan base, so Raimi included the character to please them,[14] and even began to appreciate the character himself.[16] The film's version of the character is an amalgamation of Venom stories. Eddie Brock, Jr., the human part of Venom, serves as a mirror to Peter Parker, with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests.[16] Brock's actions as a journalist in Spider-Man 3 also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism.[18] The producers also suggested adding rival love interest Gwen Stacy, filling in an \"other girl\" type that Raimi already created.[14] With so many additions, Sargent soon found his script so complex that he considered splitting it into two films, but abandoned the idea when he could not create a successful intermediate climax.[11] | Camera crews spent ten days from November 5, 2005 to November 18, 2005, to film sequences that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on the shots early in the project. The same steps had been taken for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.[19] | Principal photography for Spider-Man 3 began on January 16, 2006 and wrapped in July 2006 after over a hundred days of filming. The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19, 2006.[19] In spring 2006, film location manager Peter Martorano brought camera crews to Cleveland,[20] due to the Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city's convention center at no cost.[21] In Cleveland, they shot the battle between Spider-Man and Sandman in the armored car.[11] Afterwards, the team moved to Manhattan, where filming took place at various locations, including One Chase Manhattan Plaza, from May 26, 2006 until July 1, 2006.[19] Shooting placed a strain on Raimi, who often had to move between several units to complete the picture.[11] Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope, as the symbiote Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night.[22] | After August, pick-ups were conducted as Raimi sought to film more action scenes.[23] The film then wrapped in October, although in the following month, additional special effects shots were taken to finalize the production.[24] At the start of 2007, there were further pick-up shots regarding the resolution of Sandman's story, amounting to four different versions.[25] | John Dykstra, who won the Academy Award for Visual Effects for his work on Spider-Man 2, declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor. Dykstra's colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor,[26] leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks. This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider-Man 3 began production, creating nine hundred visual effects shots.[27] | In addition to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models.[28] In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.[29] To understand the effects of sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman.[27] For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied.[30] With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead.[31] Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona was used as the model for the CG sand.[27] In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.[32] | Whereas the symbiote suit worn in the comics by Spider-Man was a plain black affair with a large white spider on the front and back, the design was changed for the film to become a black version of Spider-Man's traditional costume, complete with webbing motif. As a consequence of this, the suit Topher Grace wore as Venom also bore the webbing motif; as producer Grant Curtis noted, \"it’s the Spider-Man suit, but twisted and mangled in its own right.\"[33] Additionally, the motif gave a sense of life to the symbiote, giving it the appearance of gripping onto the character's body.[34] When animating the symbiote, Raimi did not want it to resemble a spider or an octopus, and to give it a sense of character. The CG model is made of many separate strands.[35] When animating Venom himself, animators observed footage of big cats such as lions and cheetahs for the character's agile movements.[36] | Originally, Danny Elfman, the composer for the previous installments, did not plan to return for the third installment of Spider-Man because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi. Elfman said that he had a \"miserable experience\" working with Raimi on Spider-Man 2 and could not comfortably adapt his music.[37] Christopher Young was then announced to score Spider-Man 3 in Elfman's absence.[38] In December 2006, however, producer Grant Curtis announced that Elfman had begun collaborating with Christopher Young on the music for Spider-Man 3.[39] | Sandman's theme uses \"two contrabass saxophones, two contrabass clarinets, two contrabass bassoons and eight very low French horns\" to sound \"low, aggressive and heavy\". Young described Venom's theme as \"Vicious, my instructions on that one were that he’s the devil personified. His theme is much more demonic sounding.\"[40] Venom's theme uses eight French horns.[41] Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music to the birth of Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films.[40] Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.[41]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Amazing Spider-Man  by Stan Lee Steve Ditko","m_directed_by":"Sam Raimi","m_produced_by":"Laura Ziskin | Avi Arad | Grant Curtis","m_screenplay_by":"Sam Raimi | Ivan Raimi | Alvin Sargent","m_story_by":"Sam Raimi | Ivan Raimi","m_starring":"Tobey Maguire | Kirsten Dunst | James Franco | Thomas Haden Church | Topher Grace | Bryce Dallas Howard | James Cromwell | Rosemary Harris | J.

It was directed by Sam Raimi and scripted by Sam and Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent. It is the final film in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy. The film stars Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons, James Cromwell and Cliff Robertson in his final acting appearance. | Set one year after the events of Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker has become a cultural phenomenon as Spider-Man, while Mary Jane Watson continues her Broadway career. Harry Osborn still seeks vengeance for his father's death, and an escaped Flint Marko falls into a particle accelerator and is transformed into a shape-shifting sand manipulator. An extraterrestrial symbiote crashes to Earth and bonds with Peter, influencing his behavior for the worse. | Development of Spider-Man 3 began immediately after the release of Spider-Man 2 for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman, but at the request of producer Avi Arad, the director added Venom and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland, before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created 900 visual effects shots. | Spider-Man 3 premiered on April 16, 2007 in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the most successful film of the trilogy financially and the second film in the franchise that was released on IMAX. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Garrett, Diane (2007-04-16). \"Red carpet becoming more global\".
