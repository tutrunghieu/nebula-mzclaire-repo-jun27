Vincent Canby wrote for The New York Times: \"Year of the Dragon is light years away from being a classic, but then it makes no pretense at being anything more than what it is — an elaborately produced gangster film that isn't boring for a minute, composed of excesses in behavior, language and visual effects that, eventually, exert their own hypnotic effect.\"[14] Janet Maslin, in contrast, also writing for The New York Times, deplored a lack of \"feeling, reason and narrative continuity\", under which the actors fared \"particularly badly\", especially Ariane Koizumi whose role in the movie was \"ineffectual\".[15] | Rex Reed of the New York Post gave Dragon one of its most ecstatic reviews: \"Exciting, explosive, daring and adventurous stuff.\"[16][a 1] In his review of Cimino's later film The Sicilian, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Year of the Dragon was \"strongly plotted and moved along with power and efficiency.\"[17] Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars, calling it a \"Highly charged, arresting melodrama... but nearly drowns in a sea of excess and self-importance.\"[18] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker dismissed the film as \"hysterical, rabble rousing pulp, the kind that goes over well with subliterate audiences.\"[19] | The film has a 60% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[20] | 3rd (in 1985) - Cahiers du cinéma[21] | Quentin Tarantino has praised this film as one of his favorites,[22] naming its climactic train tracks shoot-out as one of his favorite \"Killer Movie Moments\" in 2004, remarking, \"You forget to breathe during it!\".[23] | Melanie Chisholm from the Spice Girls is shown in the music video for their 1997 single \"Too Much\" singing in a Chinatown, dressed in a red cheongsam; this scene is based upon the film.","m_production":"Michael Cimino was approached many times to helm an adaptation of Robert Daley's novel, but consistently turned the opportunity down. When he finally agreed, Cimino realized he was unable to write and direct in the time allotted; The producers already had an approximate start date for the film. He brought in Oliver Stone, whom Cimino met through his producer and friend Joann Carelli, to help him write the script.[6] | Cimino was prompted to seek out Stone after reading, and being impressed by, Stone's (at the time) unproduced Platoon screenplay. Cimino asked Stone to work on Year of the Dragon for a lower-than-normal wage as part of a quid pro quo deal, namely, that Year of the Dragon producer Dino De Laurentiis would provide the funding for Stone to make Platoon. Stone agreed to this deal, although De Laurentiis later reneged on it, forcing Stone to obtain funding for Platoon elsewhere. | \"With Michael, it's a 24-hour day,\" said Stone. \"He doesn't really sleep … he's truly an obsessive personality. He's the most Napoleonic director I ever worked with.\"[7] Cimino did a year and a half of research on the project.[8] | While Dino De Laurentiis gave director Cimino final cut in his contract, De Laurentiis also sent Cimino a side letter that said, notwithstanding the contract, he would not have final cut. This information was revealed when the producers of The Sicilian sued Cimino over the length of that film.[9] | Because the production was moving so fast, casting began before the script was completed.[6] Originally, Stone and Cimino had either Nick Nolte or Jeff Bridges in mind for the role of Stanley White, but after seeing Mickey Rourke in The Pope of Greenwich Village and working with him on Heaven's Gate, Cimino changed his mind.[10] According to Rourke, the difficulty with playing White was making himself appear 15 years older to suit the character.[8] Cimino drew heavily on the real-life boxing prowess of Rourke. At first, Rourke did not take his physical training seriously, so Cimino hired a Hells Angel to be Rourke's instructor. Rourke has often quoted in many interviews that he loved working with Cimino despite the disapproved reputation he earned himself over the years since his previous box office failures, quoting, 'He was a ball of fire. I hadn't seen anyone quite like him.'[6] | As with Streets of Fire, most of the film was shot not on location but on soundstages in Wilmington, North Carolina, after meticulous research of various locales which could be passed off as Little China and/or the Orient.[6][11] The sets proved realistic enough to fool even Stanley Kubrick, who attended the movie's premiere. Cimino actually had to convince the Bronx-born Kubrick that the film's exteriors were shot on the DEG backlot, and not on location.[6] | Other cities used in filming included New York City, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Thailand, Bangkok and Shangirey. Cimino said he often liked to shoot in different cities, with interiors in one city and exteriors in another. In one scene, Joey Tai and his lawyer walk through a Chinese textile mill, past a guard-rail and into a shoddy apartment building to meet up with two of his assassins. The textile mill was in Bangkok, the guard-rail was in New York and the apartment building was in Wilmington. When one of the script supervisors commented that the scene \"wouldn't cut\" (edit seamlessly together), Cimino bet her $1,000 that it would. Upon seeing the cut, the script supervisor conceded and Cimino won the bet but refused to take the $1,000.[6] | Unlike Heaven's Gate, Cimino was able to bring the film in on time and on budget.[7] | At the end of the film, White's final line is \"You were right and I was wrong. I'd like to be a nice guy. But I just don't know how to be nice.\" According to Cimino, the final line of White was supposed to be \"Well, I guess if you fight a war long enough, you end up marrying the enemy.\" The studio vetoed the original line, written by Stone. Cimino feels that either the studio or the producers thought the original line was politically incorrect.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Year of the Dragon  by Robert Daley","m_directed_by":"Michael Cimino","m_produced_by":"Dino De Laurentiis","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mickey Rourke | John Lone | Ariane","m_music_by":"David Mansfield","m_cinematography":"Alex Thomson","m_edited_by":"Françoise Bonnot","m_production_company":"Dino De Laurentiis Company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_distributed_by":"MGM/UA Entertainment Company Cannon Films (International)","m_release_dates":"August 16, 1985 (1985-08-16) (United States) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"134 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English Mandarin Cantonese Polish","m_budget":"US$24,000,000[2]","m_box_office":"$18,707,466 (US)[2][3][4] | Year of the Dragon is a 1985 neo-noir[5] action film directed by Michael Cimino, starring Mickey Rourke, Ariane Koizumi and John Lone.
