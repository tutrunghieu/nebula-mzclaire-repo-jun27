{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with Charlie Roan and her family bound, gagged, and covered in blood. The Purger in their home says they are going to play one final Purge game, called \"Mommy's Choice.\" Eighteen years later, two days before the Purge, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is campaigning for the Presidency with the goal of ending the Purge. She is rivaled by Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor), a candidate set up by the New Founding Fathers of America to maintain the status quo. The NFFA, headed by Caleb Warren (Raymond J. Barry), view Roan as a threat to their rule and revoke immunities on top government officials in order to eliminate her from play on Purge night. The day before the Purge, deli owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson), his assistant Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria), and EMT Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) confront a pair of teenaged shoplifters. No longer able to afford his insurance premiums for the Purge, Joe decides to stake out and guard his store. Roan decides to wait out the Purge from her unsecured home in order to secure the popular vote of the common people. Her head of security, bodyguard Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), orders her home locked down and surrounded by security, accompanied by Chief Couper (Ethan Phillips) and Eric (Adam Cantor). Many international citizens have come to participate in what may be the final Purge, thus possibly making it the most dangerous to date. | After the Purge commences, Joe and Marcos repel an attack by the shoplifters, wounding the leader, Kimmy (Brittany Mirabile). Laney patrols the city in an ambulance, rendering medical care to the wounded. Roan and Barnes are betrayed by Couper and Eric, who signal to a Neo-Nazi paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger (Terry Serpico) that attacks Roan's house. Barnes manages to get Roan to safety, but is wounded in the process. He detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Couper as well as several of Danzinger's operators. Roan and Barnes try to seek shelter elsewhere, but are ambushed by a gang of Russian Purgers and taken captive. Before they can be executed, Joe and Marcos shoot the gang dead and rescue them. As they take shelter in Joe's store, the shoplifters return to raze the building. The four are rescued by Laney, who runs over Kimmy with her ambulance and shoots the others. The group is ambushed by a helicopter, forcing them to seek refuge underneath a highway overpass. They are confronted by a large group of Crips, who back off by Joe giving the Crips gang whistle. Barnes deduces that they were tracked by the bullet lodged in him, and manages to extract it. In exchange for Laney helping the gang leader's \"boy\", the Crips trick the paramilitary forces by planting the bullet elsewhere, and wipe out Danzinger's ground team. | The group is led to a hideout beneath a hospital protected by anti-Purge rebels. Joe, Marcos, and Laney decide to go back to the store, but spot several NFFA death squad trucks headed to the hideout. Meanwhile, Roan tries to dissuade the rebels from assassinating Owens, as she wants to win the election fairly. They are forced to flee as death squad forces arrive, and the pair meet up again with the ambulance. However, the ambulance is rammed by a truck, and Roan is delivered to Owens at a Purge mass. Barnes and the others give chase and meet up with the rebel assassination team led by Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge). Owens has his assistant Harmon James (Christopher James Baker) execute a man as a cleansing ritual for his drug addiction, before inviting the members of the NFFA to execute Roan. As Warren prepares to slit her throat, Marcos kills him and forces the rest of the congregation to scatter. Bishop's team captures Owens in the basement. Bishop contemplates killing Owens to the protests of Roan and Barnes, while Owens goads him on to kill him. Bishop refrains, and allows him to live on the condition that Roan wins the election. | Bishop and his men decide to secure transport to leave the church while the Senator and her group hide in the basement, but they are ambushed by Danzinger and his mercenaries, leaving the rebel team killed and Bishop wounded. Barnes rushes out to help them, leaving the Senator in the care of Laney and company. Bishop manages to dispatch the remaining mercenaries save for Danzinger, who kills Bishop. Earl and Barnes engage in a gunfight before they both run out of ammunition, whereupon they continue fighting with their knives. Barnes gains the upper hand and kills Danzinger. In the meantime, the Senator's group is ambushed by Owens' assistant Harmon James, who wounds Marcos, incapacitates Laney, and fatally shoots Joe, who kills James with a shot to the head. With his dying breath, Joe urges the Senator to win the election. | Two months after the Purge, Roan is set to win the presidency with Barnes as her chief of security, while Marcos continues to run the store in Joe's honor. A news report indicates that halting the Purge has become Roan's highest priority, and that many pro-Purge supporters have taken to the streets in violent protest. The film ends with an ominous shot of the American flag.","m_cast":"Frank Grillo as Leo Barnes[4] | Elizabeth Mitchell as Senator Charlie Roan[5] Christy Coco as Young Charlie Roan | Mykelti Williamson[5] as Joe Dixon | Joseph Julian Soria[5] as Marcos | Betty Gabriel[5] as Laney Rucker | Terry Serpico as Earl Danzinger | Edwin Hodge as Dante Bishop | Kyle Secor as Minister Edwidge Owens[5] | Liza Colón-Zayas as Dawn[5] | Ethan Phillips as Chief Couper | Adam Cantor as Tall Eric Busmalis | Christopher James Baker as Harmon James | Brittany Mirabile as Kimmy | Raymond J.
