{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sellers plays hospital administrator Albert T. Hopfnagel, who oversees a facility that is more interested in generating revenue than it is in providing sound medical care. When construction worker Lester Hammond (Lenz) shows up needing nothing more than a chest x-ray, he is immediately admitted and subjected to a battery of tests. Meanwhile, Hopfnagel rides the staff to perform more unnecessary surgeries and pad patient bills, while making time with multiple female staff members. When Hopfnagel finally ends up in jail for his devious deeds, he plots a revenge in which he will return to the hospital as a patient and be given an unnecessary operation that he can then sue the hospital over. But the plan backfires.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"In a response typical of the film’s reception upon release, TV Guide describes it by saying, “The language is profane, the proceedings inane, and the story insane…If you hate doctors, Mexicans, homosexuals, blacks, females, Catholics, Jews, Italians, Japanese, insurance companies, hospitals, Poles, and humanity, you'll love this movie.”[1] Nonetheless, the film holds a 67% fresh rating, based on 141 reviews, on Rotten Tomatoes.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Rod Amateau","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Sellers, Jo Ann Pflug, Rick Lenz, Pat Morita, Harold Gould","m_music_by":"Keith Allison","m_cinematography":"Brick Marquard","m_edited_by":"Mario Morra Stanley Rabjohn","m_production_company":"Josef Shaftel Productions Inc.","m_distributed_by":"Cinerama Releasing Corporation (1972, original) American International Pictures (re-release)","m_release_dates":"September 29, 1972 (1972-09-29) (USA)","m_running_time":"87 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | Where Does it Hurt? is a 1972 American comedy film directed by Rod Amateau, starring Peter Sellers, Jo Ann Pflug, Rick Lenz, Pat Morita, and Harold Gould.
