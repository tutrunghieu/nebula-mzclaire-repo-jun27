{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Bernard Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines to be interviewed. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk. | Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through Phil Saviano, who heads the victims' rights group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), they widen their search to 13 priests. They learn through Richard Sipe, a former priest who worked at trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests, that statistically there should be approximately 90 abusive priests in Boston (six percent of priests). Through their research, they develop a list of 87 names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was made aware of the problem and ignored it. Although Rezendes argues vociferously to run the story immediately before more victims suffer and rival newspapers publish, Robinson remains steadfast to research further so that the systemic problem can be more fully exposed. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed that provide the evidence of that larger picture, the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002. | As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of 20 pedophile priests by lawyer Eric MacLeish in 1993 that he never followed up on. The story goes to print with a web link to the documents that expose Cardinal Law's inaction, and a phone number for victims of pedophile priests. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests took place. It also states that Cardinal Law resigned, and was eventually promoted to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, one of the biggest churches in the world.","m_cast":"Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes[11][12] | Michael Keaton as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson[13] | Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer[11] | Liev Schreiber as Marty Baron[13] | John Slattery as Ben Bradlee, Jr.[5] | Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll[14] | Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney representing victims of sexual abuse[13] | Gene Amoroso as Stephen Kurkjian, Boston Globe general investigative reporter[15] | Jamey Sheridan as Jim Sullivan, an attorney representing the Church[5][16] | Billy Crudup as Eric MacLeish, an attorney representing victims of sexual abuse[13][16] | Maureen Keiller as Eileen McNamara, Boston Globe columnist[17] | Richard Jenkins as Richard Sipe, psychotherapist (telephone voice, uncredited)[18] | Paul Guilfoyle as Peter Conley | Len Cariou as Cardinal Bernard Law | Neal Huff as Phil Saviano of SNAP[19] | Michael Cyril Creighton as Joe Crowley | Laurie Heineman as Judge Constance Sweeney | Tim Progosh as Principal Bill Kemeza","m_reception":"Spotlight grossed $45.1 million in North America and $43.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $88.3 million, against a budget of $20 million.[3] | In the opening weekend of its limited release, the film grossed $295,009 from five theaters ($59,002 average), one of the highest per-screen averages of any release of 2015.[30] The film grossed $4.4 million in the first weekend during its wide release, finishing 8th at the box office.[31] | Spotlight received universal acclaim. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a rating of 96%, based on 283 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Spotlight gracefully handles the lurid details of its fact-based story while resisting the temptation to lionize its heroes, resulting in a drama that honors the audience as well as its real-life subjects.\"[32] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[33] | Variety's Justin Chang called the film \"a superbly controlled and engrossingly detailed account of the Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into the widespread pedophilia scandals and subsequent cover-ups within the Catholic Church.\"[34] | At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, Spotlight finished third in the audience balloting for the People's Choice Award.[35] | Prior to the film's release, Cardinal Sean O'Malley of the Archdiocese of Boston issued a statement in the archdiocese's official newspaper, stating that the \"media's investigative reporting on the abuse crisis instigated a call for the Church to take responsibility for its failings and to reform itself—to deal with what was shameful and hidden.\"[36] O’Malley had not seen the movie at that time but planned to do so according to a church spokesman.[37] | On November 9, 2015, a review published by the Catholic News Service called the film a \"generally accurate chronicle\" of the Boston scandal, but objected to some of the portrayals and the film's view of the Church.[38] On the Catholic News Service, auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles Robert Barron said that it is \"not a bad movie\", as it shows that the wider community shares the responsibility for sexual abuse committed by priests, but that the film is wrong to insinuate that the Church has not reformed.[39] | Vatican Radio, official radio service of the Holy See, called it \"honest\" and \"compelling\" and said it helped the U.S. Catholic Church \"to accept fully the sin, to admit it publicly, and to pay all the consequences.\"[40] Luca Pellegrini on the Vatican Radio website wrote that the Globe reporters \"made themselves examples of their most pure vocation, that of finding the facts, verifying sources, and making themselves—for the good of the community and of a city—paladins of the need for justice.\"[40][41] In February 2016, a Vatican City commission on clerical sex abuse attended a private screening of the film.[42] Following the film's Best Picture win at the Oscars, Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano ran a column assuring that the movie is \"not an anti-Catholic film\", and Vatican Radio revealed that clerics in Rome have been recommending the film to each other.[43][44][45] | A January 8, 2016 article in The New York Times cited author David F. Pierre Jr., who said that Spotlight \"is a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases\", asserting that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments. Open Road Films rebutted the detractor, saying he was \"perpetuating a myth in order to distract from real stories of abuse.\"[46] | The film was attacked by Jack Dunn (played by Gary Galone in the film), a member of the board at Boston College High School, and its public relations head, for portraying him as indifferent to the scandal. After viewing the film, Dunn says he was immediately aware of the issues involved and worked to respond.[47] Two of the Globe reporters depicted in the film, Walter Robinson and Sacha Pfeiffer, issued a statement in response to Dunn, firmly standing by their recollections of the day, saying Dunn did \"his best to frame a story in the most favorable way possible for the institution he is representing. That’s what Jack did that day.\" They said Dunn mounted a \"spirited public relations defense of Boston College High School during our first sit-down interview at the school in early 2002,\" the lone scene in which Dunn is depicted in the film.[48] On March 15, 2016, Open Road Films released a statement on how Dunn was portrayed in the film: \"As is the case with most movies based on historical events, Spotlight contains fictionalized dialogue that was attributed to Mr. Dunn for dramatic effect. We acknowledge that Mr. Dunn was not part of the Archdiocesan cover-up. It is clear from his efforts on behalf of the victims at BC High that he and the filmmakers share a deep, mutual concern for victims of abuse.\"[49] Following this Dunn also released a statement: \"I feel vindicated by the public statement and relieved to have the record set straight on an issue that has caused me and my family tremendous pain. While it will never erase the horrific experience of being falsely portrayed in an Academy Award-winning film, this public statement enables me to move forward with my reputation and integrity intact.\"[49]","m_production":"McCarthy and Singer completed the script in June 2013.[20] It was listed on the 2013 Black List of unproduced screenplays.[21] Singer told Creative Screenwriting that one of his goals for the film was to highlight the power of journalism, which he feels has been waning. He explained, \"This story isn’t about exposing the Catholic Church. We were not on some mission to rattle people’s faith. In fact, Tom came from a Catholic family. The motive was to tell the story accurately while showing the power of the newsroom – something that’s largely disappeared today. This story is important. Journalism is important, and there is a deeper message in the story.\"[22] | Principal photography began on September 24, 2014, in Boston, Massachusetts,[23] and continued in October in Hamilton, Ontario. Filming took place at Fenway Park,[24] The Boston Globe offices in Dorchester, Boston,[17] the Boston Public Library,[25] and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.[26] The film's editor Tom McArdle said of the post-production process, \"We edited for eight months. We just wanted to keep refining the film. We cut out five scenes plus some segments of other scenes. Often we would just cut out a line or two to make a scene a little tighter.\"[27]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tom McCarthy","m_produced_by":"Blye Pagon Faust | Steve Golin | Nicole Rocklin | Michael Sugar","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mark Ruffalo | Michael Keaton | Rachel McAdams | Liev Schreiber | John Slattery | Stanley Tucci","m_music_by":"Howard Shore","m_cinematography":"Masanobu Takayanagi","m_edited_by":"Tom McArdle","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Open Road Films","m_release_dates":"September 3, 2015 (2015-09-03) (Venice) | November 6, 2015 (2015-11-06) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"129 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$20 million[2]","m_box_office":"$88.3 million[3] | Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer.[4][5] The film follows The Boston Globe's \"Spotlight\" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative journalist unit in the United States,[6] and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the \"Spotlight\" team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.[7] The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.[8] | Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.[9] It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[10] The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. Spotlight won the Academy Award for Best Picture along with Best Original Screenplay, from six nominations in total making Spotlight the first film by Open Road Films to win in either category. This also marks the first film to win Best Picture by a different mini-major studio, rather than Lionsgate, Summit (later bought by Lionsgate in 2012), Miramax and TWC. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"SPOTLIGHT (15)\".
