He is leaving for England for his studies and hopes that Angsumalin will wait for him and marry him when he returns. | Shortly thereafter, Thailand is invaded by Japanese military forces. In Thonburi, opposite Bangkok on the Chaophraya River, the Imperial Japanese Navy establishes itself at a base. The forces there are led by Kobori, an idealistic young captain. One day he sees Angsumalin swimming in the river and falls for her. She, being a proudly nationalistic Thai woman, despises him because he is a foreigner. | Nonetheless, Kobori persists at seeing her and a courtship develops. Angsumalin sees a way to use Kobori to serve the underground Free Thai Movement while she waits for Vanus. | Then, for political reasons, Angsumalin's father insists that she marry Kobori. Understanding that Angsumalin is not marrying him out of love, Kobori promises not to touch her, but he breaks that vow after the wedding. | Despite this, Angsumalin develops tender feelings for Kobori, but is still torn by her feelings for her nation and Vanus, who returns to set in motion a conflict between the two men.","m_cast":"Bird McIntyre as Kobori | Apasiri Nitibhon as Angsumalin (In Japannese name Hideko) | Thiraphat Sajakul as Vanus | Supakorn Srisawat as Pol | Deux Doksadao as Bua | Chitrakorn Sundarapakshin as Angsumalin's father","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Euthana Mukdasanit","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Bird McIntyre Apasiri Nitibhon","m_music_by":"Anuwat Surbsuwan","m_cinematography":"Pipat Pyakha","m_edited_by":"Warapa Kasemsri","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Grammy Film","m_release_dates":"1996 (1996) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"135 minutes","m_country":"Thailand","m_language":"Thai, Japanese | Sunset at Chaophraya (Thai: คู่กรรม, Khu Kam) is a 1996 romantic-drama film directed by Euthana Mukdasanit.
