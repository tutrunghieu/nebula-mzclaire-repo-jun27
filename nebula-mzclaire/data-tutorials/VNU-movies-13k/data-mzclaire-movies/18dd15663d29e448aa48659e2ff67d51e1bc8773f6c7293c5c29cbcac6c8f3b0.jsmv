{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in third century BC China, the story of The Emperor's Shadow revolves around the relationship between Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, and later the First Emperor; and the musician Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli's mother was the king's wet nurse when the young king was a hostage in the Zhao state, but they were separated after the former returns to Qin to become king. | After reaching adulthood, Ying Zheng embarks on a series of wars to fulfill his plan of unifying China. He kidnaps Gao Jianli from the Yan state to compose a powerful anthem for his new state. The two conflict over the new composition, the construction of grand public works, Ying Zheng's ruthless mass killing policies, and Ying Zheng's daughter, Princess Yueyang.","m_cast":"Jiang Wen as Ying Zheng Tian Ming as young Ying Zheng | Ge You as Gao Jianli Wang Peng as young Gao Jianli | Xu Qing as Princess Yueyang | Ge Zhijun as Zhao Gao | Wang Qingxiang as Li Si | Di Guoqiang as Wang Jian | Wang Ning as Wang Ben | Shu Yaoxuan as Xu Fu | Li Mengnan as Jing Ke | Yuan Yuan as Fan Yuqi | Ren He as Huhai | Zhao Yi | Wang Hong | Sun Bicheng | Zhang Chunyuan","m_reception":"After The Emperor's Shadow was released in five major Chinese cities, it was banned by state authorities without any clear reason being given. Eight months later permission was given for re-release. | The film has been criticized in China for its many historical inaccuracies. Chief among these is the distortion of the character of Gao Jianli. According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, Gao Jianli was a friend of the assassin Jing Ke, who fails in an attempt upon Ying Zheng's life. Other minor errors, mostly of academic interest, also contribute to the film's lack of historical authenticity. The director Zhou Xiaowen defended his film by saying that it was an exploration of ideas and values for the present day and was not intended as a strictly historical depiction of the First Emperor. In a 1999 interview, he said \"I don't like history; I just like the buildings, the palaces, the dress.\" | The film influenced the creation of Tan Dun's 2006 opera The First Emperor.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Zhou Xiaowen","m_produced_by":"Chen Zhitao","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jiang Wen Ge You Xu Qing Ge Zhijun","m_music_by":"Zhao Jiping","m_cinematography":"Lü Gengxin","m_edited_by":"Zhong Furong","m_production_company":"Xi'an Film Studio Ocean Film Co., Ltd.","m_distributed_by":"Fox Lorber (U.S.)","m_release_dates":"October 31, 1996 (1996-10-31) (Hong Kong) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"116 minutes","m_country":"China","m_language":"Mandarin | The Emperor's Shadow is a 1996 Chinese historical film directed by Zhou Xiaowen and starring Jiang Wen, Ge You, Xu Qing and Ge Zhijun.
