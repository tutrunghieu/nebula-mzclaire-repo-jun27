{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Duke brothers Randolph (Ralph Bellamy) and Mortimer (Don Ameche) own a successful commodities brokerage in Philadelphia. Holding opposing views on the issue of nature versus nurture, they make a wager of the \"usual amount\" and agree to conduct an experiment switching the lives of two people at opposite sides of the social hierarchy and observing the results. They witness an encounter between their managing director—the well-mannered and educated Louis Winthorpe III (Dan Aykroyd), engaged to the Dukes' grand-niece Penelope—and a poor street hustler named Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy); Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe's insistence because of a suspected robbery attempt. The Dukes decide to use the two men for their experiment. | Winthorpe is publicly framed as a thief, drug dealer and adulterer by Clarence Beeks (Paul Gleason) at the request of the Dukes. Winthorpe is fired from Duke & Duke, his bank accounts are frozen, he is denied entry to his Duke-owned home and he quickly finds himself vilified by Penelope and his former friends. He befriends Ophelia (Jamie Lee Curtis), a prostitute who agrees to help him in exchange for a financial reward once he is exonerated. Meanwhile, the Dukes bail Valentine out of jail, install him in Winthorpe's former job and grant him use of Winthorpe's home. Valentine soon becomes well-versed in the business using his street smarts to achieve success and begins to act well-mannered. | During the firm's Christmas party, Winthorpe is caught planting drugs in Valentine's desk in a desperate attempt to get his job back, and he brandishes a gun to escape. Later, the Dukes discuss their experiment and settle their wager for one dollar, before plotting to return Valentine to the streets. Valentine overhears the conversation while smoking a joint in the men's bathroom and seeks out Winthorpe. Winthorpe attempts suicide by overdosing on pills. Valentine, Ophelia and Winthorpe's butler Coleman nurse him back to health and inform him of the Dukes' experiment. On television, they learn that Clarence Beeks is transporting a secret USDA report on orange crop forecasts. Winthorpe and Valentine recall large payments made to Beeks by the Dukes and realize that the Dukes plan to obtain the report to corner the market on frozen orange juice. The group agrees to disrupt their plan as revenge. | On New Year's Eve, the four board Beeks' Philadelphia bound train, intending to switch his report with a fake. Beeks uncovers their scheme and attempts to kill them, but he is knocked unconscious by a gorilla who is being transported on the train. The four disguise Beeks with a gorilla costume and lock him up with the real gorilla. The fake report indicating that the year's orange crop will be low is then delivered to the Dukes. Valentine and Winthorpe then travel to New York City with Coleman's and Ophelia's life savings to carry out their part of the plan. | On the commodities trading floor, the Dukes commit all their holdings to buying frozen concentrated orange juice futures contracts; other traders follow their lead, inflating the price. Meanwhile, Valentine and Winthorpe sell futures heavily at the inflated price. Following the broadcast of the actual crop report, showing that the orange crop will be normal, the price of orange juice futures plummets. Valentine and Winthorpe close their futures position by buying futures at the lower price from everyone but the Dukes, turning a large profit. The Dukes fail to meet a margin call, and are left owing $394 million. Valentine and Winthorpe explain to the Dukes that they had made a wager on whether they could simultaneously get rich while making the Dukes poor. Valentine collects $1 from Winthorpe while Randolph collapses holding his chest as Mortimer shouts angrily at his brother about their failed plan. | Beeks and the gorilla are loaded onto a ship heading for Africa. Meanwhile, the now wealthy Valentine, Winthorpe, Ophelia and Coleman vacation on a luxurious tropical beach.","m_cast":"Dan Aykroyd as Louis Winthorpe III | Eddie Murphy as Billy Ray Valentine | Ralph Bellamy as Randolph Duke | Don Ameche as Mortimer Duke | Denholm Elliott as Coleman | Jamie Lee Curtis as Ophelia | Kristin Holby as Penelope Witherspoon, Louis Winthorpe's fiancée. | Paul Gleason as Clarence Beeks | The cast also includes Robert Curtis-Brown as Todd, Winthorpe's romantic rival for Penelope; James Belushi as Harvey, a party-goer on New Year's Eve; Jamie Lee Curtis' sister Kelly Curtis cameos as Penelope's friend Muffy; Frank Oz as a police officer; James Eckhouse as a police officer; Muppet performer Richard Hunt as Wilson; and Bo Diddley as a pawnbroker.

He turns it into an event.\"[19] Film critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half stars out of four, while offering that the film resembles Tootsie and comparing it to comedies of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges. Ebert stated \"This is good comedy\"; he commended the character development in the film calling the characters \"wonderful comic inventions\" and explained that the comedy is successful because it \"develops the quirks and peculiarities of its characters, so that they're funny because of who they are.\" He further commented on the cast by favorably commenting on acting as \"engaging\", stating that \"Murphy and Aykroyd are perfect foils for each other\", that they're both capable of being \"specifically eccentric\", that \"they both play characters with a lot of native intelligence\" and concluding that \"It's fun to watch them thinking.\" Commenting on Bellamy and Ameche in the roles of the Duke brothers, Ebert called their involvement in the film \"a masterstroke of casting.\"[3] | Janet Maslin of The New York Times repeated some of Roger Ebert's sentiments stating that \"Preston Sturges might have made a movie like Trading Places - if he'd had a little less inspiration and a lot more money.\" She, again, also commended the cast by calling it \"well-chosen\", commenting on Murphy and Aykroyd as \"the two actors best suited\", stating that the Duke brothers were \"played delightfully\" by Ameche and Bellamy and—concluding that \"the supporting cast is also quite good\"—praising Curtis for managing \"to turn a hard-edged, miniskirted prostitute into a character of unexpected charm.\"[20] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe called it \"easily the best of the movies I've seen by the various Saturday Night Live alumni.\"[21] Empire magazine awarded the film a rating of four stars out of five, classifying Trading Places as \"Excellent\" per the magazine's star rating system, stating that Murphy and Aykroyd are the show-stealers.[22] A review of the film published by Variety magazine called the film \"a light romp geared up by the schtick shifted by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy.\" The review gave further commendations to supporting actors, stating that Murphy and Aykroyd \"couldn't have brought this one off without the contributions of three veterans - Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche and the droll Englishman, Denholm Elliott\" and calling the presence of Jamie Lee Curtis \"enjoyable.\"[23] | The film received several award nominations in 1984 including an Academy Award,[24] two Golden Globes,[25] and three BAFTA awards.
