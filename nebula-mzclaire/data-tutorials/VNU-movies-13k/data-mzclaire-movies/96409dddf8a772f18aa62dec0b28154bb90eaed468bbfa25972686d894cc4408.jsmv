{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is centered on the America's Cup series of yachting races and uses them as a backdrop for both an action/adventure and a romantic storyline.[1] It is inspired by real events, starting from the loss of the 1983 America's Cup through the events of the 1987 America's Cup. Several of the 12-metre class yachts that participated in the Cup races were repainted and used in the movie. The boat and team representing the US to win used the name Geronimo in their comeback and take back the cup from Australia. Added authenticity was provided by New Zealand's long time America's Cup commentator Peter Montgomery. \"Wind\" contains some of the best, most realistic, on deck big-boat sailing sequences ever portrayed in a commercial film (with subtle explanations of the actions).","m_cast":"Matthew Modine as Will Parker | Jennifer Grey as Kate Bass | Cliff Robertson as Morgan Weld | Jack Thompson as Jack Neville | Stellan Skarsgård as Joe Heiser | Rebecca Miller as Abigail Weld | Ned Vaughn as Charley Moore","m_reception":"Wind received mixed reviews, as the film holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. | Wind grossed $96,798 at the box office in Australia.[4] The movie flopped at the US box office.[5]","m_production":"American Eagle (US 21), the red 12 Meter ocean endurance champion sailed to fame by Ted Turner in the mid-seventies was used as the trial horse sailed by Will Parker in preparation for the America's Cup. The boat had been a finalist in the 1964 Defender selection series, but lost the selection to Constellation. The 12 Meter yachts depicting the America's Cup races were the more modern boats from the America II Syndicate, America II (US 42) and America II (US 46). The boat repainted as Boomerang and later as Platypus was depicted by US 42, and Radiance and then later Geronimo were depicted by US 46. US 46 had been sailed by John Kolius in the 1987 Louis Vuitton Challenger Selection Cup races. | Many of the film's port scenes were filmed on location in and around Newport, Rhode Island, with the sailing scenes of the International 14's competition and the America's Cup races filmed off Perth in Western Australia.
