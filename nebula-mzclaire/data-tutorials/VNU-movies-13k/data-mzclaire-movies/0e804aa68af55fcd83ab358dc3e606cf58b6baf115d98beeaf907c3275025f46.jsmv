{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Batwoman employs the services of several young female agents known as \"Batgirls\", in her pursuit of justice. Her archenemy is a masked villain named \"Rat Fink\". Added to the mix is the President and Vice-President of the \"Ayjax\" Development Corporation. The company, using plutonium as its fuel source, has created a powerful listening device called \"The Atomic Hearing Aid\", which allows for limitless eavesdropping. The company has been ordered to destroy the hearing aid by the US Government when the government turned down the offer to buy the listening device (due to its unstable power supply) but the President of the company has refused to do so and now is being confronted by Rat Fink about selling him the device. | The Vice President of Ayjax recruits Batwoman to protect the device but Rat Fink's minions use drugged bowls of soup to incapacitate Batwoman and her allies and steal the device. The two storm the lair and retrieve it, unmasking Rat Fink and converting one of his minions, Tiger, to the side of justice after he falls in love with one of the Batgirls.","m_cast":"Katherine Victor as Batwoman | George Andre as Professor G.

Fred Beldin of the film database AllMovie gave the film one and a half stars out of five, noting the film as \"a rip-off hack job no matter how you slice it, though its innocent veneer, period charm, and forced wackiness might endear the film to fans of similar goofs like Rat Pfink a Boo-Boo or The Nasty Rabbit\".[6] Film director Fred Olen Ray noted the film has \"all the earmarks of Warren's worst work, but rises above the level as something as tedious as Petrified World. It is funny in an unintentional way and sometimes is not hard to look at.\"[1]","m_production":"The original idea for the film began with Jerry Warren realizing there was large popularity with the comic book superhero Batman; Warren decided to make his own Bat-like superhero character into a film.[1] Warren offered the leading role to Katherine Victor. Having worked on Warren's previous productions such as Teenage Zombies and Curse of the Stone Hand, Victor was originally not very excited about working with Warren again.[1] To convince her, Warren promised Victor large production values, color photography and her own bat boat in the film.[1] None of these promises ever came to fruition.[1] On receiving the script for the role of Seltzer, Bruno VeSota recalled that \"...once again I was in for it. It would be like memorizing a telephone book with pages picked at random.\"[1] Katherine Victor claimed that on set if an actor rubbed Warren the wrong way, their lines would be cut out or given to other actors.[2] Victor claimed \"the pretty brunette who was kidnapped in the beginning of the picture was supposed to be the lead girl, but for some reason Jerry thought she was getting too big for her britches and gave all her lines to the girl in the leopard tights\".[2] | For the monsters in the film, Warren used footage from the Universal Pictures film The Mole People.[2] Several other scenes throughout the film are also taken from different films, one of which seems to have been from a Swedish film, judging by a background sign reading \"Livsmedel\", a Swedish word used for grocery stores.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jerry Warren","m_produced_by":"Jerry Warren","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Katherine Victor George Andre Steve Brodie Richard Banks","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"William G.
