{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":"The major roles in the movie were following: | Max von Sydow as Jesus | Dorothy McGuire as the Virgin Mary | Charlton Heston as John the Baptist | Claude Rains as Herod the Great | Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas | Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate | Martin Landau as Caiaphas | David McCallum as Judas Iscariot | Donald Pleasence as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of Satan) | Michael Anderson, Jr. as James the Just | Roddy McDowall as Matthew | Joanna Dunham as Mary Magdalene | Joseph Schildkraut as Nicodemus | Ed Wynn as \"Old Aram\" | Smaller roles (some only a few seconds) were played by Michael Ansara, Ina Balin, Carroll Baker, Robert Blake, Pat Boone, Victor Buono, John Considine, Richard Conte, John Crawford, Jamie Farr, David Hedison, Van Heflin, Russell Johnson, Angela Lansbury, Mark Lenard, Robert Loggia, John Lupton, Sal Mineo, Nehemiah Persoff, Sidney Poitier, Gary Raymond, Marian Seldes, David Sheiner, Abraham Sofaer, Paul Stewart, John Wayne and Shelley Winters. | For The Greatest Story Ever Told, Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in Ingmar Bergman's dramatic films.[7] Stevens wanted an unknown actor free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.[8] | The Greatest Story Ever Told featured an ensemble of well-known actors, many of them in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman centurion who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"[9][10]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Stevens shot The Greatest Story Ever Told in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah. Pyramid Lake in Nevada represented the Sea of Galilee, Lake Moab in Utah[11] was used to film the Sermon on the Mount, and California's Death Valley was the setting of Jesus' 40-day journey into the wilderness.[3][12] | Stevens explained his decision to use the U.S. rather than in the Middle East or Europe in 1962. \"I wanted to get an effect of grandeur as a background to Christ, and none of the Holy Land areas shape up with the excitement of the American southwest,\" he said. \"I know that Colorado is not the Jordan, nor is Southern Utah Palestine. But our intention is to romanticize the area, and it can be done better here.\"[3] | Forty-seven sets were constructed, on location and in Hollywood studios, to accommodate Stevens' vision.[13] The Jerusalem city set was built near the northwest corner of RKO Forty Acres by early 1963, and was demolished soon after filming was completed that summer.[14] | To fill location scenes with extras, Stevens turned to local sources – R.O.T.C. cadets from an Arizona high school played Roman soldiers (after 550 Navajo Indians from a nearby reservation allegedly did not give a convincing performance; other sources claim they weren't on set long enough and left early to take part in a tribal election[15])[16] and Arizona Department of Welfare provided disabled state aid recipients to play the afflicted who sought Jesus' healing.[3] | Principal photography was scheduled to run three months but ran nine months or more[17] due to numerous delays and setbacks (most of which were due to Stevens' insistence on shooting dozens of retakes in every scene).[18] Joseph Schildkraut died before completing his performance as Nicodemus, requiring scenes to be rewritten around his absence. Cinematographer William C. Mellor had a fatal heart attack during production; Loyal Griggs, who won an Academy Award for his cinematography on Stevens’ 1953 Western classic Shane, was brought in to replace him. Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.[3] | Much of the production was shot during the winter of 1962-1963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor David Sheiner, who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting Nanook of the North.\"[19] Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area – it was scheduled to become Lake Powell with the completion of the Glen Canyon Dam, and the production held up the project.[3] | Stevens brought in two veteran filmmakers. Jean Negulesco filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets while David Lean shot the prologue featuring Herod the Great.[5] Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod.[20] | By the time shooting was completed in August 1963, Stevens had amassed six million feet of Ultra Panavision 70 film (about 1829 km or 1136 miles, roughly the radius of the Moon). The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to $142 million in 2010) plus additional editing and promotion charges,[21] making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.[5][22] | The film was advertised on its first run as being shown in Cinerama. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"George Stevens","m_produced_by":"George Stevens","m_screenplay_by":"James Lee Barrett George Stevens","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Max von Sydow Dorothy McGuire Charlton Heston Jose Ferrer Telly Savalas","m_music_by":"Alfred Newman","m_cinematography":"Loyal Griggs William C.
