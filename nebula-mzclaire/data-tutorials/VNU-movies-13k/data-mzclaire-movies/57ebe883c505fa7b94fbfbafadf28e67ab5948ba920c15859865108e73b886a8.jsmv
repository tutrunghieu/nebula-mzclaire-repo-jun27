{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A group of four misfits, Argyris, Andreas, Marina, and Sofia, live together in a house. Andreas just got out of jail. All four have become disillusioned with life and have lost any reason to live or die. They try all criminal experiences with each member of the group choosing a different activity to experiment in: frequenting expansive restaurants and leaving without paying, shoplifting, starring in pornographic films, and creating an anti-state organization. The authorities put them under surveillance, waiting for the slightest false step from any of them before acting violently. The first such misstep occurs when Sofia kills the police chief who monitors their home.","m_cast":"Despina Tomazani as Sofia | Dora Maskalvanou as Marina | Takis Moschos as Argyris | Takis Spiridakis as Andreas | Alkis Panagiotidis as Xanthos | Lenia Polycrati as Roza | Konstantinos Tzoumas as Konstantinos | Dinos Makris | Andreas Tsafos | Haris Romas | Takis Loukatos | Alkmini Stavrou | Marianna Koutalou | Katerina Sigountou | Fay Tsanetopoulou | Natasa Kapsabeli | Isavella Mavraki | Natasha Assiki | Fotini Kotrotsi | Hristos Zygomalas | Panayotis Kaldis | Manos Tsilimidis | Giorgos Polyhroniadis | Panos Thanassoulis | Nikos Katomeris | Elias Kostandakopoulos | Nikos Stavropoulos | Giannis Kouriotis | Spiros Bibilas | Kostas Baladimas","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Nikos Nikolaidis","m_produced_by":"Nikos Nikolaidis","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Despina Tomazani Dora Maskalvanou Takis Moschos Takis Spiridakis Alkis Panagiotidis Lenia Polycrati Konstantinos Tzoumas Dinos Makris Andreas Tsafos Haris Romas Takis Loukatos Alkmini Stavrou Marianna Koutalou Katerina Sigountou Fay Tsanetopoulou Natasa Kapsabeli Isavella Mavraki Natasha Assiki Fotini Kotrotsi Hristos Zygomalas Panayotis Kaldis Manos Tsilimidis Giorgos Polyhroniadis Panos Thanassoulis Nikos Katomeris Elias Kostandakopoulos Nikos Stavropoulos Giannis Kouriotis Spiros Bibilas Kostas Baladimas","m_music_by":"Giorgos Hatzinasios The Fontane Sisters McGuire Sisters Eddie Cochran Giuseppe Verdi Adolphe Adam Johann Sebastian Bach","m_cinematography":"Aris Stavrou","m_edited_by":"Andreas Andreadakis","m_production_company":"Vergeti Brothers Greek Film Center","m_distributed_by":"Greek Film Center Restless Wind","m_release_dates":"19 October 1983 (Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema)","m_running_time":"146 Minutes","m_country":"Greece","m_language":"Greek | Sweet Gang (Greek: Γλυκιά Συμμορία, tr. Glykia Symmoria) is a 1983 Greek dramatic experimental independent surrealist underground art film directed by Nikos Nikolaidis. The film, produced by Vergeti Brothers and the Greek Film Center, is the second part of the \"Years of Cholera\" trilogy beginning with The Wretches Are Still Singing (1979) and ending with The Loser Takes It All (2002) which deals with the last decades of the twentieth century. The original Greek title directly references the Greek title of the 1969 Sam Peckinpah film The Wild Bunch (Greek: Άγρια Συμμορία, tr. Agria Symmoria). The film uses as background music the 1958 song \"Sugartime\" written by Charlie Phillips and Odis Echols as well as the 1940 song \"Sweet Mara\" (Greek: «Γλυκιά Μαράτα,» tr. \"Glykia Marata\") composed by Leo Rapitis to lyrics by Kostas Kofiniotis which was performed by Kakia Mendri.
