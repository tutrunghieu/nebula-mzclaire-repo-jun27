{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he kills Thomas, who reveals that he is James's real father. James flees along with Thomas's son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James defends Victor and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody, and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but the group's (especially Victor's) disregard for human life causes James to leave. | Six years later, James (now using the name Logan) is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan. Logan takes down Zero's helicopter, killing him, and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor. | Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor is still working for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called \"The Island\". Fred mentions Remy \"Gambit\" LeBeau, is the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in New Orleans, then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Stryker's facility on Three Mile Island. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been coerced by Stryker into keeping tabs on him in exchange for her sister's safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a \"mutant killer\" with the powers of multiple mutants, who he refers to as the \"Deadpool\". | While Logan and Victor join forces to fight Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the Island's captive mutants- including a teenager named Scott Summers- to safety. The mutants are subsequently rescued by Professor Charles Xavier. Logan decapitates Weapon XI, destroying one of the cooling towers in the process. Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering him unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He sees Kayla's body, but does not recognize her, and leaves the island. | In a mid-credits scene, Stryker is detained for questioning by some MPs in connection with the death of his superior, General Munson, whom Stryker did in fact kill after Munson declared his intention to shut down Stryker's project. In a post-credits scene, Logan tells a Japanese barmaid he's \"drinking to remember\".","m_cast":"Hugh Jackman as James Howlett / Logan / Wolverine: | Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed: | Danny Huston as Major William Stryker: | will.i.am as John Wraith: | Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox: | Kevin Durand as Fred J. Dukes / The Blob: | Dominic Monaghan as Chris Bradley: | Taylor Kitsch as Remy LeBeau / Gambit: | Daniel Henney as Agent Zero: | Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson: | Additionally, Tim Pocock portrays a young Scott Summers / Cyclops. Max Cullen and Julia Blake portrayed Travis and Heather Hudson, an elderly couple who take care of Wolverine after his adamantium bonding. The Hudsons are heavily adapted from the comics' James MacDonald and Heather Hudson. Tahyna Tozzi portrays Emma, a mutant with the power to turn her skin into diamond, who in the film is Silverfox's sister.[30] The film depiction of Emma was originally assumed to be Emma Frost. However it was noted that she does not exhibit the character's traditional telepathic abilities. It is later revealed by Bryan Singer that is character is actually not Emma Frost, but instead a mutant with similar abilities.[31] Wolverine's parents also appeared in the film; Aaron Jeffery portrayed Thomas Logan while Alice Parkinson portrayed Elizabeth Howlett. Peter O'Brien appeared as John Howlett, James' alleged father. The film includes numerous cameo appearances of younger versions of characters from the previous films, including Jason Stryker (William Stryker's lobotomized telepathic son whom he keeps in cryogenic suspension).[32] There was a cameo for a young Storm, which can be seen in the trailer, but it was removed from the released film.[33] A digitally rejuvenated Patrick Stewart also makes an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier who appeared to not yet lose the use of his legs.[34] However, with timeline and story inconsistencies within the film series, Singer developed an idea to tie all the films together and fix the continuity. In X-Men: First Class Xavier loses the use of his legs at a much younger age, than he appears in Origins. As an explanation, Xavier can be seen walking in X-Men: Days of Future Past (which chronologically takes place prior to the events of this film), by creating the illusion that he is standing in various scenes, when in reality the character is only present by telepathic projection.[35][36] Asher Keddie played Dr. Carol Frost.[37] Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo. Phil Hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in Toronto.[38] X-Men co-creator Stan Lee said he would cameo, but Lee ended up not appearing in the film as he could not attend filming in Australia.[39][40]","m_reception":"The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported 38% positive reviews based on 252 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's consensus is, \"Though Hugh Jackman gives his all, he can't help X-Men Origins: Wolverine overcome a cliche-ridden script and familiar narrative.\"[122] | Richard Corliss of TIME commented on the film's standing among other Marvel films, saying that it is \"an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy.\" He also said that \"superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make sense of it all.\"[123] James Mullinger of GQ also commented on the structure of the story in saying that the \"film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James [Howlett], AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X-Men saga. In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes.\"[124] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was generally more favorable towards Origins, stating \"Fortunately, Jackman is well-matched with Schreiber, who can sneer with the best of them and wears fangs well. The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor.\"[125] Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackman's performance, saying that \"Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song-and-dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage.\"[126] Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie \"well-acted, with spectacular action and witty one-liners\".[127] | Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and expressed his views on the title character: \"Why should I care about this guy? He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so therefore he's essentially a story device for action sequences.\"[128] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine two and a half stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past \"there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in\", and that the revelations made Wolverine \"less compelling\".[129] Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive \"4.0 out of 5 stars,\" saying that although Hugh Jackman is \"capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season.\" He predicted \"there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;\" and further said that \"any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal.\"[130] | Regarding Wolverine within the context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: \"Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction.\"[131] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue.\"[132] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's \"dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff\" is \"of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics.\"[133] | Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph stated that \"Wolverine is an artificial stimulus package of the most unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there’s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned.\"[134] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: \"There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying.\"[135] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of \"D\", noting that \"Wolverine was the lead character of [the X-Men] films, and we've already learned everything we need to know from the films in said franchise,\" adding that \"the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting.\"[136] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that \"how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to be a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them\", while also being \"a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing\".[137] | Hugh Jackman later confessed being unhappy with the final result of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The actor wanted primarily a film that would deepen the Wolverine character, but “somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up looking like the fourth X-Men — just with different characters.” He tried to avert the same results while doing the next solo film for the character, 2013's The Wolverine.[138]","m_production":"David Benioff, a comic book fan, pursued the project for almost three years before he was hired to write the script in October 2004.[41][42] In preparing to write the script, he reread Barry Windsor-Smith's \"Weapon X\" story, as well as Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character (his favorite storyline).[41][43] Also serving as inspiration was the 2001 limited series Origin, which reveals Wolverine's life before Weapon X.[44] Jackman collaborated on the script, which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with the previous X-Men films.[45] Skip Woods, who had written Hitman for Fox, was later hired to revise and rewrite Benioff's script.[46] Benioff had aimed for a \"darker and a bit more brutal\" story, writing it with an R rating in mind, although he acknowledged the film's final tone would rest with the producers and director.[41] | Deadpool had been developed for his own film by Reynolds and David S. Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003, but the project fell apart as they focused on Blade: Trinity and an aborted spin-off.[26] Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described as fun, but would also deviate from some of his traits. Similarly, Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried to put in the previous X-Men films. Jackman liked Gambit because he is a \"loose cannon\" like Wolverine, stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy.[5] David Ayer contributed to the script.[47] Benioff finished his draft in October 2006, and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting,[48] as he was scheduled to start filming Australia during 2007.[49] Before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last-minute rewrite.[50] | Gavin Hood was announced as director of the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release.[51] Previously, X-Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and X-Men: The Last Stand director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise,[52][53] while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job.[54][55] Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen.[56] Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Hood's previous film Tsotsi.[11] Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he \"realized that the character of Wolverine, I think his great appeal lies in the fact that he's someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self-loathing by his own nature and he's constantly at war with his own nature\".[57] The director described the film's themes as focusing on Wolverine's inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities. Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin-off a different feel.[58] Hood also suggested to make the implied blood relation of Wolverine and Sabretooth into them explicitly being half brothers, as it would help \"build up the emotional power of the film\".[59] In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009, release date and the X-Men Origins prefix.[13] | Preliminary shooting took place at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007.[60] Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand.[61] One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin.[62] Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area.[63] The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras.[64] Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly.[65] According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting.[66] | Filming continued at Fox (where most of the shooting was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana.[13] Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.[11] Production of the film was predicted to generate A$60 million for Sydney's economy.[67] Principal photography ended by May 23. The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap.[68] This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales.[69] | Hood and Fox were in dispute on the film's direction. One of the disputes involved the depiction of Wolverine as an Army veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, with the executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes.[70] The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on-set tensions.[71] Hood remarked, \"Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better. [...] I hope the film's better because of the debates. If nobody were talking about us, we'd be in trouble!\"[11] Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both \"forceful\" personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a \"stand-up\" argument.[72] In January 2009, after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts, such as Hugh Jackman's publicity commitments for Australia, production moved to Vancouver, mostly at Lord Byng Secondary School and in University of British Columbia.[73][74] Work there included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography.[75] | Gavin Hood has announced that multiple \"secret endings\" exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film.[76] One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar. The bartender asked if he is drinking to forget, Logan replies that he is drinking to remember.[77] The other shows Weapon XI on the rubble of the destroyed tower, trying to touch his severed head.[78] | More than 1,000 shots of Wolverine have visual effects in them, which required three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies to work on the film.[79] The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws.[79] CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups.[80] Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.[79][80]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Wolverine  by Roy Thomas Len Wein John Romita, Sr.","m_directed_by":"Gavin Hood","m_produced_by":"Lauren Shuler Donner | Ralph Winter | Hugh Jackman | John Palermo","m_screenplay_by":"David Benioff | Skip Woods","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Hugh Jackman | Liev Schreiber | Danny Huston | Dominic Monaghan | Ryan Reynolds","m_music_by":"Harry Gregson-Williams","m_cinematography":"Donald McAlpine","m_edited_by":"Nicolas De Toth | Megan Gill","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"April 9, 2009 (2009-04-09) (Sydney Premiere) | May 1, 2009 (2009-05-01) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"107 minutes","m_country":"United States[1][2]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$150 million[3]","m_box_office":"$373.1 million[3] | X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 2009 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics fictional character Wolverine, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the fourth installment and the first spinoff in the X-Men film series. The film was directed by Gavin Hood, written by David Benioff and Skip Woods, and produced by and starring Hugh Jackman. It co-stars Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Dominic Monaghan and Ryan Reynolds. The film is a prequel/spin-off focusing on the violent past of the mutant Wolverine and his relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed. The plot details Wolverine's childhood as James Howlett (Troye Sivan), his early encounters with Major William Stryker, his time with Team X, and the bonding of Wolverine's skeleton with the indestructible metal adamantium during the Weapon X program. | The film was mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand, with Canada also serving as a location. Production and post-production were troubled, with delays due to the weather and Jackman's other commitments, an incomplete screenplay that was still being written in Los Angeles while principal photography rolled in Australia, conflicts arising between director Hood and Fox's executives, and an unfinished workprint being leaked on the Internet one month before the film's debut. | X-Men Origins: Wolverine was released worldwide on May 1, 2009, the film was a financial success, opening at the top of the box office and grossing $179 million in the United States and Canada and over $373 million worldwide. The movie received mixed reviews, with critics considering the film uninspired, criticizing its screenplay and poorly-produced CGI, though praising Jackman's performance. Jackman himself was unhappy with the film. Another Wolverine film titled The Wolverine was released in 2013 to positive reviews. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"LUMIERE : Film: X-Men Origins: Wolverine\".  | ^ \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) - Overview - TCM.com\".  | ^ a b c \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)\".
