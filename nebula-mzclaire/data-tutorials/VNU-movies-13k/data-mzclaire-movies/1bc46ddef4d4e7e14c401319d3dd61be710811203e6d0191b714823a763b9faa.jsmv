Owen Gleiberman opined that \"Terminal Velocity is the kind of movie in which the hero keeps sneaking into rooms to peek into some file and you wait, with glum certitude, for yet another ”surprise” thug to leap out of the shadows. It’s fun to hear Charlie Sheen deliver quips like, 'I’m not just a walking penis — I’m a flying penis!' But for most of the movie, Sheen, lowering his voice to a basso he-man growl, gives a boringly flat, square-jawed performance, as if he thought he were doing Hot Shots! Part Quatre.\"[5] Roger Ebert opined that \"Sheen's behavior in this and other scenes is so close to the self-parody of his work in the 'Hot Shots!' movies that he almost seems to be telling us something - such as, that he takes the movie with less than perfect seriousness. No wonder. It's based on such a goofy premise that with just a nudge here and a pun there it could easily have become \"Hot Shots Part Cinq\" and taken advantage of the franchise. It's not so much that Sheen can keep a straight face in any situation, as that he always seems to be testing himself with the situations he gets himself into.\"[6] | The movie debuted at No. 2 at the box office behind Timecop.[7] It eventually made $16.4 million in ticket sales, making it a box office flop compared to its $50 million budget.","m_production":"The final stunt – with Sheen at the wheel of a Cadillac Allanté falling to earth – was a mixture of bluescreen and camera work, as a real car was suspended beneath a helicopter and then a reverse zoom made it seem as if it were in free-fall. | Portions of the film were shot in Palm Springs, California.[2]:168–71 Other filming locations were Alabama Hills (Lone Pine, California); a windfarm near Tehachapi, California; Douglas, Arizona; Flagstaff, Arizona; Little Colorado River Canyon, Arizona; Moscow, Russia; Phoenix, Arizona; San Bernardino, California and Tucson, Arizona, where a cameo appearance by Martha Vasquez of its station KVOA was filmed.[3][4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Deran Sarafian","m_produced_by":"David Twohy Ted Field Robert W.
