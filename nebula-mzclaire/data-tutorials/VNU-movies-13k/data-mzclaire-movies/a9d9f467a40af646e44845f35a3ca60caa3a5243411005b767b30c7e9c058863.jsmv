{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus narrates a flashback of a soccer match between France and China. French coach Yves Gluant enters the stadium, wearing the Pink Panther diamond ring. He kisses his girlfriend, a pop star named Xania, and whispers something to her. After France wins the game in sudden death, Gluant dies from a poison dart, with the Pink Panther nowhere to be found. Eager to win the Medal of Honour, Dreyfus promotes a clumsy small-town policeman and \"village idiot\", Jacques Clouseau, to the rank of Inspector and assigns him to the Pink Panther case. Meanwhile, Dreyfus assembles a secret team of top investigators to crack the case, allowing Clouseau to serve as the public face of the investigation, drawing all the media attention. Dreyfus assigns Gilbert Ponton to be Clouseau's assistant. He instructs Ponton to keep him informed of Clouseau's actions. Ponton quickly becomes good friends with Clouseau and remorseful of his orders. | Bizu, a French footballer who had an affair with Xania, and therefore is the prime suspect in Gluant's murder, is shot in the head by an unknown assassin in the team's locker room. While at a casino to gain information, Clouseau encounters British Secret Agent 006, Nigel Boswell. Boswell foils a robbery at the casino by the notorious \"Gas-Masked Bandits\", using Clouseau's trenchcoat to hide his identity. Clouseau mistakenly receives credit for the deed in the press and is nominated for the Medal of Honour, much to Dreyfus' dismay. | Clouseau follows Xania to New York City, suspecting that she knows more than she is telling. However, despite Ponton's insistence that she is most likely a suspect because Gluant cheated on her, Clouseau decides Xania is innocent. The two eat hamburgers from McDonald's, and Clouseau discovers his love for the sandwich, which he had assumed to be disgusting. Meanwhile, because the poison that killed Gluant was derived from Chinese herbs, Dreyfus concludes that the killer is a Chinese envoy named Dr. Pang. Now ready to take charge of the case and win the Medal of Honour, Dreyfus has one of his officers switch Clouseau's bag with one full of weapons at the airport for his return flight to France. The bag sets off the metal detector at the security gate, and Clouseau is arrested due to his inability to pronounce \"hamburger\" correctly, as he tried to smuggle some for the trip back. Upon his return to France, the press vilifies him and Dreyfus strips him of his rank for \"trying to become a hero\". The Chief Inspector now plots to publicly arrest Dr. Pang at the Presidential Ball, where Xania will also be performing. | When Clouseau reads an online article about his arrest, he deduces from the photograph in it that the murderer will next target Xania, and he contacts Ponton. The two detectives rush to the Élysée Palace and sneak into the Presidential Ball. While Dreyfus publicly arrests Dr. Pang for double murder, Clouseau and Ponton save Xania's life by capturing her would-be assassin, Yuri, the soccer team's Russian trainer. Jealous of Gluant, Yuri used his knowledge of Chinese herbs, mandated by a statute, to kill him. After overhearing Yuri's rants, Bizu blackmailed him and Yuri used his knowledge of the location of the occipital lobe to kill Bizu. Yuri targeted Xania out of revenge for her dismissal of him while she dated Gluant. Clouseau reveals the diamond was never stolen but sewn into the lining of Xania's purse, which he saw in the photograph. She received it from Gluant as an engagement ring and hid it because she was worried it could implicate her. Clouseau concludes that Xania is the rightful owner of the ring. Yuri is taken into custody. | For successfully solving the case, Clouseau wins the Medal of Honour. While leaving with Ponton, following the ceremony, Clouseau accidentally gets Dreyfus's jacket caught on his car; he remains oblivious to Dreyfus's screams as he drives away. Clouseau and Ponton later visit him in the hospital. After Clouseau wishes him well, he accidentally releases the brake on Dreyfus's bed; the bed races through the hospital and throws Dreyfus into the Seine, and he shouts Clouseau's name in anger as he takes the plunge into the river and back to the insane asylum.","m_cast":"Steve Martin as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, a bumbling police officer from a small village in France. | Kevin Kline as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus, the head of the French police who is obsessed with winning the Medal of Honour. | Jean Reno as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton, a capable police officer who is assigned to report to Dreyfus on Clouseau's actions. | Emily Mortimer as Nicole Durant, a secretary and romance interest of Clouseau. | Henry Czerny as Yuri, the Russian trainer for the fictionalized version of the France national football team. | Kristin Chenoweth as Cherie, an employee of the France national football team. | Roger Rees as Raymond Laroque, a wealthy casino owner and friend of Yves Gluant. | Beyoncé Knowles as Xania, a famous pop singer and girlfriend of Gluant. | William Abadie as Bizu, a player for the France national football team. | Scott Adkins as Jacquard, another player for the France national football team. | Charlotte Maier as Dialect Coach | Anna Katarina as Agent Corbeille | Alice Taglioni as Female Reporter | Kristi Angus as Mysterious Woman | Chelah Horsdal as Security Guard | Delphine Chanéac as Ticket Checker (as Délphine Chaneac) | Yvonne Sciò as Casino Waitress | Jason Statham as Yves Gluant (uncredited), the head coach of the France national football team whose murder is under investigation. | Clive Owen as Nigel Boswell/Agent 006 (uncredited), a secret agent and parody of James Bond. | Paul Korda as Pierre Fuquette (uncredited), a man thought to be murdered, until Clouseau finds him alive and well. | Jackie Chan was originally offered the part of Clouseau's manservant, Cato Fong, but turned it down due to his perceived political incorrectness.
