{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Winnie-the-Pooh wakes up one day to find that he is out of honey. While out searching for more, Pooh discovers that Eeyore has lost his tail. Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Kanga, and Roo come to the rescue while Tigger has his bouncing fun, and Christopher Robin decides to hold a contest to see who can find a replacement for Eeyore's tail. The prize for the winner is a fresh pot of honey. After many failed attempts for what would replace Eeyore's tail (including a cuckoo clock, then a yoyo, an umbrella, a dartboard, misc toys, a vane, and a concertina), Kanga suggests that they use a scarf, which unravels. | The next day, Pooh goes to visit Christopher Robin and he finds a note that says \"Gone Busy Out, Back Soon (misspelled as \"Gon Out Bizy Back Soon\")\". Because Pooh is unable to read the note, he asks for Owl's help. Owl's poor reading comprehension skills lead Pooh and his friends to believe that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a ruthless and mischievous monster they call the \"Backson\" and Owl describes it in a song that is shown in a chalk-drawn scene. Rabbit plans to trap the Backson in a pit, which they think he will fall into after following a trail of items leading to it. Meanwhile, Tigger, who wants a sidekick to help him defeat the Backson, recruits Eeyore to be a second Tigger. He dresses up like the Backson and tries to teach Eeyore how to fight. Eeyore, who is doing this against his will, escapes from Tigger and hides underwater. | After a failed attempt to get honey from a bee hive, Pooh's imagination combines with his hunger get the better of him which has ended up eating some mud and later, accidentally falls into the pit meant for the Backson. Rabbit, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Piglet, and Eeyore (who has found an anchor while he is hiding to replace his own tail) try to get him out, but fall in themselves. Piglet, who did not fall in, attempts to get Pooh and friends out of the trap (though continuously irritating Rabbit with over-interpretations of his instructions), but he runs into Tigger, still in his Backson outfit, and mistakes him for the actual monster. Piglet escapes from Tigger on a red balloon, which knocks some of the storybook's letters into the pit. After the chase, Tigger and Piglet fall into the trap as well, where Eeyore reminds Tigger that he, being \"the only one,\" is \"the most wonderful thing about Tiggers\". Eventually, Pooh figures out to use the fallen letters to form a ladder, and his friends are able to escape the pit. They soon find Christopher Robin, and tell him about the Backson, but he clarifies, saying that he meant to be \"back soon.\" The hunny pot prize has given to the red balloon from earlier, much to Pooh's dismay. | Later, Pooh visits Owl only to find that Owl is the one that has taken Eeyore's tail, not realizing that it belongs to Eeyore. Owl has been using Eeyore's tail as a bell-pull for his door. Pooh chooses to leave and return the tail to Eeyore instead of sharing a pot of honey with Owl. Christopher Robin is proud of Pooh's selflessness and rewards him with a large pot of honey. | In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that the rumored Backson actually exists deep in the woods, but is much friendlier than imagined. He discovers the trail of objects that the animals left, and picks up each one, planning to return them to whoever owns them. He ends up falling into the pit that was originally meant for him and waits for someone to arrive and help him out. He adds, \"I sure hope that fellow will be back soon.\"","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Winnie the Pooh received generally positive reviews, with many praising the animation, voicing, script, and the musical numbers (notably \"The Backson Song\" and \"Everything Is Honey\"), but some criticizing the very short film length. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 90% of 126 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.2 out of 10.[23] Its consensus states \"Short, nostalgic, and gently whimsical, Winnie the Pooh offers young audiences—and their parents—a sweetly traditional family treat.\"[23] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 74 based on 26 reviews.[24] CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film an A- on an A+ to F scale.[25] | Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times says the film \"proves a fitting tribute to one of the last century's most enduring children's tales.\"[26] The film has been praised for not only being able to charm the children audience but the parents as well.[27] Roger Ebert, giving it 3 stars out of 4, said in his review \"In a time of shock-value 3-D animation and special effects, the look of the film is gentle and pleasing. It was hand-animated, I'm told, and the backgrounds use a subtle and reassuring watercolor style. It's a nightmare-proof experience for even the youngest viewers.\"[28] | While Platform Online stated that Winnie the Pooh's \"hand-drawn animation is such a welcome relief\", it found the film's run-time length to be more of an issue, which it stated \"At just 70 minutes, even aiming at kids this could have been longer – Pixar have been pushing films well over 90 minutes for years now, and it's clear the children can handle it. Just as you really get into the film it's over, and you're left wanting more.\"[19] | Despite favorable reviews, Winnie the Pooh only found modest success at the American box office, mainly because it opened on the same weekend as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. It earned $7,857,076 in its opening weekend from 2,405 single-screen locations, averaging about $3,267 per venue, and ranking No. 6 for the weekend.[29][30] The film closed on September 22, 2011, with a final domestic gross of $26,692,846, with the opening weekend making up 29.44% of the final gross. It also made $18,000,000 overseas, bringing its worldwide gross to $44,692,846, according to BoxOffice.com, making it a box office disappointment, considering its $30 million budget. The international grosses include $4.13 million in Japan, $1.33 million in Germany, $1.29 million in Poland, $1.18 million in the UK and $1.14 million in Russia.[31]","m_production":"In 2009, John Lasseter, Stephen J. Anderson, and Don Hall viewed the classic Winnie the Pooh feature shorts and films to figure out how to make the title character culturally relevant.[9] Following a trip to Ashdown Forest in Sussex, South East England to explore the location of A.A. Milne's original stories, the filmmakers enlisted Burny Mattinson, a Disney veteran who worked as the key animator on Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too, to serve as lead storyboard artist for the film, with Anderson and Hall directing.[10] Director Stephen Anderson is best known for his effort on Meet the Robinsons, Journey Beneath the Sea, Brother Bear, The Emperor's New Groove, and Bolt. Director Don Hall also has veteran status at Walt Disney Animation Studios, significantly contributing to The Princess and the Frog, Meet the Robinsons, Brother Bear, Home on the Range, The Emperor's New Groove, and Tarzan.[10] Supervising animators for the film included Mark Henn (Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin),[11] Andreas Deja (Tigger),[12] Bruce W. Smith (Piglet, Kanga, Roo), Randy Haycock (Eeyore), Eric Goldberg (Rabbit and the Backson) and Dale Baer (Owl).[13] Similar to The Princess and the Frog, the film also uses Toon Boom Animation's Harmony software.[14] | Originally, the film was supposed to feature three stories from the A. A. Milne books, but the final version ended up drawing inspiration from five stories.[15] Executive producer John Lasseter had also announced that Rabbit's friends and relatives would be in the film, but their scene was ultimately deleted.[16][17]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Classic Winnie-the-Pooh  by A.
