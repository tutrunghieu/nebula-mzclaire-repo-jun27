It was written by Neal Jimenez. | The film is a semi-autobiographical story about a young fiction writer who becomes tetraplegic fully paralyzed in a hiking accident and works to rehabilitate his body and mind at a rehabilitation center. The title refers to a dream recounted by Raymond, the Snipes character, about dancing on the surface of a lake. Since, in Raymond's dream, he must continue dancing on the lake or sink and drown, the dream may be a metaphorical reference to the necessity of continually coping with the world. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Waterdance (1992)\".
