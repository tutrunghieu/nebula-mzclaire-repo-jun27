{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Mari Collingwood plans to attend a concert with her friend, Phyllis Stone for her 17th birthday. Her parents, Estelle and John, expresses concern about the band and about Mari's friendship with Phyllis, but let her go and give her a peace symbol necklace. Phyllis and Mari then go to the city for the concert. On the way, they hear a news report on the car radio of a recent prison escape involving criminals Krug Stillo, a sadistic rapist and serial killer; his son Junior; Sadie, a promiscuous psychopath[5] and sadist; and Fred \"Weasel\" Podowski, a child molester, peeping tom and murderer. Before the concert, Mari and Phyllis encounter Junior when trying to buy marijuana. He leads them to an apartment where they are trapped by the criminals. Phyllis tries to escape, then tries to reason with the criminals, but she fails and is gang-raped by Krug, Weasel and Sadie. Meanwhile, Mari's unsuspecting parents prepare a surprise party for her. | The next morning, Mari and Phyllis are gagged, put in the trunk of their car, and transported to the woods by the criminals. Mari recognizes that the road is near her home. Mari and Phyllis are forced to perform sexual acts to each other, and Sadie attempts to perform oral sex on a weeping Mari. Phyllis distracts the kidnappers to give Mari an opportunity to escape but is chased by Sadie and Weasel, while Junior stays behind to guard Mari. Mari tries gaining Junior's trust by giving him her necklace and naming him \"Willow\". Phyllis is then cornered by Krug with a machete and stabbed to death by Weasel. Soon after, seeing her leaning up against a tree, barely still alive and in shock, Sadie reaches into Phyllis's wounds and pulls out her insides. | Mari convinces Junior to let her go, but they are halted by Krug. Sadie and Weasel present Phyllis's severed hand as Mari screams. Krug carves his name into Mari's chest then rapes her. She vomits, quietly says a prayer, and walks into the nearby lake to clean herself. Krug then fatally shoots her, leaving her body floating in the lake. Krug, Sadie, and Weasel wash up and change out of their bloody clothes. | In their new attire, the gang goes to the Collingwoods' home, masquerading as travelling salesmen. Mari's parents let them stay overnight, but Junior exposes their identity and orders them to leave. Later that night Junior is in the bathroom coughing and throwing up when Estelle enters in to check on him and sees that he's wearing Mari's peace symbol necklace. She eavesdrops while the gang is spending the night in Mari's bedroom and finds blood-soaked clothing in their luggage. She and her husband rush into the woods where they find Mari's body on the bank of the lake. They carry Mari's body back to the house and exact revenge against the crooks. | Estelle seduces Weasel and performs fellatio on him that turns deadly when she bites off his penis and leaves him to bleed to death. Mari's father John takes his shotgun into the room where two of the criminals are sleeping and shoots at them, but Krug escapes into the living room and overpowers John and is then confronted by Junior, brandishing a revolver and threatening to kill him. But before he can do so, Krug manipulates Junior into committing suicide and Junior suddenly shoots himself. Krug is incapacitated by an electrocution booby-trap set earlier by John. Sadie rushes outside where she is tackled by Estelle. Sadie then escapes and falls into the backyard swimming pool where Estelle slits her throat with a knife. The sheriff arrives just as John kills Krug with a chainsaw. The then deputy brings Estelle into the living room before removing the chainsaw from John's hands.","m_cast":"Sandra Peabody as Mari Collingwood | Lucy Grantham as Phyllis Stone | David A.

Cunningham made his directorial debut with the white coater film The Art of Marriage. His film grossed $100,000 and attracted the company Hallmark Releasing (unaffiliated with Hallmark Cards Inc.). Cunningham made the film Together as a \"better version\" of film. Wes Craven, who had no money, was put on the job of synchronizing dailies for Cunningham's four-day re-shoot.[6] He soon began editing the film with Cunningham and they became good friends. Hallmark Releasing bought the film for $10,000 and it was considered a \"hit\". Hallmark Releasing wanted them to do another film with a bigger budget and gave them $90,000 to shoot a horror film. | Cunningham served as producer and Craven served as writer and director. | Written by Craven in 1971, the original script was intended to be a graphic 'hardcore' film, with all actors and crew being committed to filming it as such.[6] However, after shooting began, the hard decision was made to edit down to a much softer film. This script, written as Night of Vengeance, has never been released; only a brief glimpse is visible in the featurette Celluloid Crime of the Century, and a sample is available in the UK DVD release. | The film was shot on location in New York City, as well as Long Island and rural locations outside of Westport, Connecticut.[8] | The film's soundtrack was written by Stephen Chapin and David Hess. Chapin wrote all the incidental music for the movie; he also did all the arrangements and orchestration as well as all the contracting and producing musicians. | Hess also played the main antagonist Krug. It is particularly notable for being heavily contrasted with the events on screen. For example, as the gang drives the two girls out into the countryside, the upbeat, almost comical tune \"Baddies Theme\" plays and, after the rape scene, a soothing ballad plays. This counterpointing was also used elsewhere in the film, with the slapstick antics of the two police officers occurring in between scenes of torture. The soundtrack was released commercially around the same time as the film. In 1999 the soundtrack was re-released on compact disc by Hess on Rock Bottom Rules Records. In 2013 the soundtrack had a re-release on vinyl, compact disc, cassette and digital download on One Way Static Records. It was also re-issued on a limited hand numbered picture disc for Record Store Day 2014.[9][10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Wes Craven","m_produced_by":"Sean S.

Cunningham. The film follows two teenage girls who are taken into the woods and tortured by a gang of murderous thugs. The story is inspired by the 1960 Swedish film The Virgin Spring, directed by Ingmar Bergman, which in turn is based on a Swedish ballad \"Töres döttrar i Wänge\".[3] | Craven's directorial debut, the film was made on a modest budget of $87,000, and was filmed in New York City and rural Connecticut in 1971. It was released theatrically in the United States on August 30, 1972, and was a major box office success, grossing over $3 million domestically. Although its confrontational violence resulted in its being heavily censored and sometimes banned in other countries, the film was generally well received by critics.[4] The film was remade into The Last House on the Left in 2009. |  | ","m_marketing":"The film underwent many name changes, including Sex Crime of the Century (from the characters' dialogue in the car ride scene), Krug and Company (a version included on the DVD release), and The Men's Room (simply because one poster showed a men's bathroom). None of these names were particularly successful. Someone then came up with the title The Last House on the Left, along with the infamous \"To avoid fainting, keep repeating 'It's only a movie'...\" advertising campaign. (In actuality, it had been used twice before: first for gore-meister H.G. Lewis's 1964 splatter film Color Me Blood Red, and then for William Castle's Strait-Jacket the following year.) The film under the Last House... title proved to be a massive hit. Stories as to where the advertising campaign originated vary somewhat. Sean Cunningham claims that the person who gave the idea for it was watching a cut of the film with his wife, who continually covered her eyes, prompting him to tell her that it was \"only a movie\". Other origins have been suggested, however.[11] The tagline was so successful that many other exploitation films later used it, sometimes with their own spin. The title was sometimes imitated, as in the case of Last House on Dead End Street.[12]","m_reference":"^ Top Ten Low Budget Films Under $500,000. Daily Film Dose.
