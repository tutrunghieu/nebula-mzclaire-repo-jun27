It never becomes clear quite what he is, though. And before the audience even has time to get used to him, he has become involved in a convoluted plot that probably worked better on the page than it does on the screen. ...As directed by Larry Peerce, Why Would I Lie? isn't often funny, especially since Cletus's tall tales generally have a macabre ring. ...Mr. Williams can be charming, but he has none of the whimsical nature that might make Cletus's exploits believable.\"[1]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Larry Peerce","m_produced_by":"Pancho Kohner Shelly Abend Stuart Wallach Rich Irvine James L.
