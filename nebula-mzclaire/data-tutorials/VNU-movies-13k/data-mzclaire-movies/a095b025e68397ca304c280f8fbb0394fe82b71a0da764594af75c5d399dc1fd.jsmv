{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film was met with mixed and emotional reactions when it was shown at the New York Film Festival. Director Dan Argott described the Q&A session that followed the film: \"People were yelling, screaming at each other. These issues bring out these emotions. I’m not sure why. But for some reason the Barnes stirs something up in people.\"[3] Executive Producer Lenny Feinberg said \"[We had] no idea we would ever be where we are today ... everywhere we go, there's lines of people. We've not had a Q&A session where they haven't had to throw us out, because it went on too long.\"[4] | Ten days after its premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, the film was acquired by Rainbow Media, now AMC Networks, and owner of IFC Films.[5] The film was ultimately distributed to more than 100 theaters in North America and made available for online streaming through SundanceNow.[6] [7] | In addition to the New York Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival, the film was also named an Official Selection of the AFI Film Festival 2009.[8] | In response to the film's release, Bernard C. Watson, chairman of the Barnes Foundation board of trustees and one of the figures criticized in the film, published an editorial letter in The Philadelphia Inquirer claiming the film \"lacks objectivity and perspective.\"[9] Derek Gillman, president and executive director of the foundation, said, \"The film was full of unsubstantiated allegations and very one-sided. It was made by people who were hostile to the move and very angry about it. That's why we didn't cooperate with the filmmakers. It was not in our interests to do so.\"[2] | Director Don Argott argued that presenting the story unfairly was not his intention, saying that he wanted supporters of the move to have a voice in the film. He added, \"there are a lot of allegations and accusations and ... I think in fairness, certainly as a documentary filmmaker you want to have everybody's point of view come across in the most fair way that you can and we tried.\"[10]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Don Argott","m_produced_by":"Sheena M.

The move was disputed because Doctor Albert C. Barnes, who died in 1951, had specifically selected Lower Merion Township for its location. The collection was moved in 2012 to downtown Philadelphia.[1] The film presents an account of the claimed breaking of Barnes' will, which it presents as a decades-long process that was initiated by Philadelphians who were enemies of Barnes while he was alive, and that was continued by their heirs. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Art of Stealing from the Rich and Dead\".
