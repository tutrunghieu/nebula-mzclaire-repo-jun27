{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Lieutenant Commander Charlie Madison (James Garner), United States Naval Reserve, is a cynical and highly efficient adjutant to Rear Admiral William Jessup (Melvyn Douglas) in London in 1944. Madison's job as a dog robber is to keep his boss and other high-ranking officers supplied with luxury goods and amiable Englishwomen. He falls in love with a driver from the motor pool, Emily Barham (Julie Andrews), who has lost her husband, brother, and father in the war. Madison's pleasure-seeking \"American\" lifestyle amid wartime rationing both fascinates and disgusts Emily, but she does not want to lose another loved one to war and finds the \"practicing coward\" Madison irresistible. | Profoundly despondent since the death of his wife, Jessup obsesses over the US Army and its Air Corps overshadowing the Navy in the forthcoming D-Day invasion. The mentally unstable admiral decides that \"The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor.\" A film will document the death, and the casualty will be buried in a \"Tomb of the Unknown Sailor.\" | Despite his best efforts to avoid the duty, Madison and his gung-ho friend, Lieutenant Commander \"Bus\" Cummings (James Coburn), find themselves and a film crew with the combat engineers who will be the first on shore. When Madison tries to retreat to safety, Cummings forces him forward with a pistol. A German shell lands near Madison, making him the first American to die on Omaha Beach. Hundreds of newspaper and magazine covers reprint a photograph of Madison on the shore, making him a hero. Jessup, having recovered from his breakdown, regrets his part in Madison's death but plans to use it in support of the Navy when testifying before a Senate committee in Washington. Losing another man she loves to the war devastates Emily. | Then comes unexpected news: Madison is not dead, but alive and well in an English hospital. A relieved Jessup now plans to show him during the Senate testimony as the heroic \"first man on Omaha Beach.\" Madison, angry about his senseless near-death, uncharacteristically plans to act nobly by telling the world the truth of what happened on the beach, even if it means being imprisoned for cowardice. Emily persuades him to choose, instead, happiness with her by keeping quiet and accepting his heroic role.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1965, for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography,[15] and in 1966 Julie Andrews' portrayal of Emily earned her a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress.[16]","m_production":"According to James Garner, William Holden was originally meant to play the lead role of \"Charlie\" Madison. Garner was originally selected to play the character \"Bus\" Cummings. When Holden backed out of the project, Garner took the lead role, and James Coburn was brought in to play \"Bus\".[8] The resulting movie was one of Garner's favourites.[9] | The film introduced the song \"Emily\" which was composed by Johnny Mandel with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The song was recorded by Frank Sinatra with Nelson Riddle arranging and conducting on October 3, 1964 and included in the Reprise LP, Softly, as I Leave You. It was later recorded by Barbra Streisand for The Movie Album (2003).","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Americanization of Emily  by William Bradford Huie","m_directed_by":"Arthur Hiller","m_produced_by":"Martin Ransohoff","m_screenplay_by":"Paddy Chayefsky","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"James Garner | Julie Andrews | Melvyn Douglas | James Coburn | Joyce Grenfell | Keenan Wynn | William Windom","m_music_by":"Johnny Mandel","m_cinematography":"Philip H.
