The film marked Hussain's evolution into a director. He had written films like Munimjee and Paying Guest. | The film was conceived as a star vehicle for its heroine Ameeta, who was the protégée of Filmistan Studios owner Tolaram Jalan. Much care was taken with her make-up, wardrobe and lighting. Much of the film's extensive publicity was also built around the actress. | Ironically, the film's huge success at the box office, made the then-struggling Shammi Kapoor, an overnight sensation instead. This was the film where he developed his own individual look and youthful style and was his first light-hearted musical and its success helped move him to acting in this genre. The film also stars the popular villain and character actor Pran. Its music is by O.P. Nayyar and lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. | The film was originally offered to Dev Anand but he declined due to which Amita and Shammi Kapoor came in his place. The film's original lyricist was Sahir who wrote the title song but he too opted out and Majrooh took his place.
