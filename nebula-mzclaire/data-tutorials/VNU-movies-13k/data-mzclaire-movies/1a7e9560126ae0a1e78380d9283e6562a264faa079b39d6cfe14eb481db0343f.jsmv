{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Four retired mobsters Bobby (Richard Dreyfuss) - the straight man leader, Bats ([Burt Reynolds]]) - a cantankerous man with a short fuse and a pacemaker, Mouth (Dan Hedaya) - a silent ladies man many years past his prime, and Brick (Seymour Cassel) - a nice but dimwitted man plan one last crime to save their apartment at a retirement home (the owners are forcing them out with a rent increase so that the apartments can be rented to young, affluent South Beach couples). The four steal a corpse from the mortuary to use as the \"victim\" in a staged murder scene. Unknown to them, the body was that of Luis Ventanna, the head of a Colombian drug smuggling ring. As a result of the \"murder\", many of the young renters leave and the four men are given cash and a rent discount by the complex to keep living there. Much of this money is spent on high living and women, which causes a young stripper, Ferris (Jennifer Tilly) to discover that the four men staged the murder - while spending time with the normally-silent \"Mouth,\" he reveals that his mouth is loosened by intimacy with women. | To keep the woman quiet, the four agree to kill her stepmother (Lainie Kazan), but instead kidnap her and fake her death by setting fire to her mansion. In the process, they accidentally burn down the house of the drug-smuggler's son (Miguel Sandoval), who happened to live in a nearby mansion. Believing that someone is trying to usurp his power, the drug lord offers $100,000 to anyone who brings him the head of the man responsible. This results in a confrontation at the apartment, leading to the capture of a female police officer and her partner (Carrie-Anne Moss and Jeremy Piven), one of the wiseguys (Seymour Cassel), the young woman, and the stepmother. The other wiseguys manage to escape this conflict, and track down the men who kidnapped their friend. | They call in all of their still-living former associates from their active years and lay siege to the ship where the drug lord is holding his prisoners. They then turn the ship and the drug smugglers over to the police, along with a shipment of drugs. A truckload of Cuban cigars is taken by the men and used to make their apartment complex into \"a retirement home for old wiseguys who are down on their luck.\" | A sub-plot of the movie involves Richard Dreyfuss' search for his long lost daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), whom he hasn't seen since he was in his 30s and she was a small child.","m_cast":"Richard Dreyfuss as Bobby Bartellemeo | Burt Reynolds as Joey \"Bats\" Pistella | Dan Hedaya as Mike \"The Brick\" Donatelli | Seymour Cassel as Tony \"Mouth\" Donato | Carrie-Anne Moss as Detective Olivia Neal | Jeremy Piven as Detective Steve Menteer | Jennifer Tilly as Maureen \"Ferris\" Lowenstein | Lainie Kazan as Pepper Lowenstein | Miguel Sandoval as Raul Ventana | Casey Siemaszko as Young Bobby | Matthew Borlenghi as Young Joey \"Bats\" | Billy Jayne as Young Tony \"Mouth\" | Jeremy Ratchford as Young Mike \"The Brick\" | Samantha Kurzman as Young Olivia | Jose Zuniga as Escobar | Mike Moroff as Jorge | Carlos Gomez as Miguel | Louis Lombardi, Jr. as Jimmy Whistles | Frank Vincent as Marty | Louis Guss as Jerry \"the Hammer\" Fungo","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Dinner","m_produced_by":"Barry Sonnenfeld","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Richard Dreyfuss","m_music_by":"Steve Bartek","m_cinematography":"Juan Ruiz Anchía","m_edited_by":"Nicholas C.
