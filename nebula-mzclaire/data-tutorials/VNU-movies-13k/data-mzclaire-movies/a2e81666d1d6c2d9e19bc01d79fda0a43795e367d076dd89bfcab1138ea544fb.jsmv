{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Richard the Lionheart (Ian Hunter), the King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by Leopold V, Duke of Austria while returning to England. Richard’s treacherous brother Prince John (Claude Rains) usurps the throne and proceeds to oppress the Saxons, raising taxes to secure his own position. | Only the Saxon nobleman Sir Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn) opposes him. Robin acquires a loyal follower when he saves Much the Miller's Son (Herbert Mundin) from being arrested for poaching by Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone). At Gisbourne's castle, Robin boldly tells Prince John and his followers and a contemptuous Lady Marian Fitzwalter (Olivia DeHavilland) that he will do all in his power to restore Richard to the throne. Robin escapes, despite attempts by John's men to stop him. | Robin and friend Will Scarlet (Patric Knowles) take refuge in Sherwood Forest and recruit Little John (Alan Hale, Sr.), while other men join their growing band, including the rotund Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette). | Known now as the outlaw Robin Hood, he binds his men by an oath: to fight for a free England until the return of Richard, to rob the rich and give to the poor, and treat all women with courtesy, \"rich or poor, Norman or Saxon\". | Robin and his men capture a large party of Normans transporting tax proceeds. Among Robin's \"guests\" are Sir Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper) and the Lady Marian. At first disdainful of Robin, Marian comes to accept his good intentions and begins to see the reality of Norman brutality. Robin allows the humiliated Gisbourne and the Sheriff to leave Sherwood, telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for their spared lives. | The Sheriff comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin by announcing an archery tournament, sure that Robin will be unable to resist the challenge. All goes as planned: Robin wins, is taken prisoner, and is sentenced to hang. | Marian helps Robin's men rescue Robin, and he later scales a castle wall to thank her. Both pledge their love for each other, but Marian declines to leave, believing she can help the rebellion as a spy by staying where she is. | King Richard and several trusted knights have returned, disguised as pilgrims. At an roadside inn, the Bishop of the Black Canons (Montagu Love) discovers their presence and alerts Prince John and Gisbourne. Dickon Malbete (Harry Cording), a degraded former knight, is given the task to dispose of Richard in return for the restoration of his rank and Robin's manor and estate. | Marian overhears their plot and writes a note to Robin, but Gisbourne finds it and has her arrested. Marian's nurse, Bess (Una O'Connor), romantically involved with Much, sends him to warn Robin. On his way, Much encounters and kills Dickon. | King Richard and his men disguise themselves as wealthy monks and journey through Sherwood Forest and are soon stopped by Robin. Richard assures him that he is traveling on King Richard's business. Will finds the injured Much, who tells Robin of Marian's peril and that Richard is now in England. Robin orders a thorough search to find Richard and bring him to Robin for safety. Now certain of Robin's loyalty, Richard reveals himself. | Robin devises a plan to sneak his men into Nottingham castle. He coerces the Bishop of the Black Canons to include his men, disguised as monks, in his entourage. During John's coronation in the great hall, a huge melee breaks out. Robin and Gisbourne engage in prolonged combat, ending with Gisbourne's death. Robin releases Marian from her prison cell, and Prince John's men, now defeated, throw down their swords, shields, and banners in surrender. | Richard exiles John and his followers and then pardons the outlaws. He ennobles Robin as Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham, and commands that Robin marry the Lady Marian. With Marian now by his side, from across across the great hall, Robin replies with enthusiasm, \"May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, Sire!\"","m_cast":"Errol Flynn as Sir Robin of Locksley AKA Robin Hood | Olivia de Havilland as Lady Marian Fitzwalter (Maid Marian) | Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne | Claude Rains as Prince John | Patric Knowles as Will à Gamwell AKA Will Scarlett | Eugene Pallette as Friar Tuck | Alan Hale, Sr. as John Little AKA Little John | Herbert Mundin as Much, the Miller's Son | Melville Cooper as the High Sheriff of Nottingham | Una O'Connor as Bess | Ian Hunter as King Richard the Lionheart | Montagu Love as the Bishop of the Black Canons | Harry Cording as Dickon Malbete | Ivan F.

Nugent of The New York Times.[11] \"It is cinematic pageantry at its best\", raved Variety. \"A highly imaginative retelling of folklore in all the hues of Technicolor, deserving handsome boxoffice returns\".[12] Film Daily called it \"high class entertainment\" with \"excellent direction\" and an \"ideal choice\" in the casting of Flynn.[13] \"Excellent entertainment!\" wrote Harrison's Reports. \"Adventure, romance, comedy, and human appeal have been skilfully blended to give satisfaction on all counts ... The duel in the closing scenes between the hero and his arch enemy is the most exciting ever filmed\".[14] John Mosher of The New Yorker called it \"a rich, showy, and, for all its tussles, somewhat stolid affair\", praising Flynn's performance and the action sequences but finding the \"excellent collection\" of supporting actors to be \"somewhat buried under the medieval panoply\".[15] | Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 44 reviews, with an average score of 8.9/10. The film is currently No. 12 on Rotten Tomatoes' list of best rated films.[16] Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus as, \"Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen\".[17] | The Adventures of Robin Hood became the sixth-highest grossing film of the year,[5] with just over $4 million in revenues[1] at a time when the average ticket price was less than 25 cents.[18] Warner Bros. was so pleased with the results that the studio cast Flynn in two more color epics before the decade was over:[citation needed] Dodge City and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. | A sequel, Sir Robin of Locksley was announced but never developed.[8] | The film won three Academy Awards at the 11th Academy Awards and was nominated for one more: | Academy Awards (1938): | Other honors: In 2001 the film came in at #84 on \"The Best Films of All Time\" as voted by channel 4. In 2001 the film appeared at #100 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills list. In 2003 the main character, Robin Hood, appeared as the #18 Hero on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list. In 2005 the film appeared at #11 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores list.","m_production":"The Adventures of Robin Hood was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, the most expensive film Warner Bros. had ever made up to that time.[5] It was also the studio's first large budget color film utilizing the three-strip Technicolor process.[Note 2][6] It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which had made a name for itself in producing socially-conscious, low-budget gangster films,[7] but their adventure movies starring Flynn had generated hefty revenue and Robin Hood was created to capitalize on this.[citation needed] | James Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his contract with Warner Bros., paving the way for Flynn,[6] although filming was postponed three years.[8] | The film was shot on location in various areas of California. Bidwell Park in Chico stood in for Sherwood Forest,[9] although one major scene was filmed at the California locations \"Lake Sherwood\" and \"Sherwood Forest\", so named because they were the location sites for the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks production of Robin Hood. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at Lower Arroyo Park [10] in Pasadena. | Stunt men and bit players, padded with balsa wood on metal plates, were paid $150 per arrow for being shot by professional archer Howard Hill. Hill, although listed as the archer captain defeated by Robin, was cast as Elwen the Welshman, an archer seen shooting at Robin in his escape from Nottingham castle and, later, defeated by Robin at the archery tournament. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. An examination of the film images in slow motion led to speculation[who?] that the arrow split may have been made of bamboo and had been previously split, the parts being held together with small rings. Buster Wiles – a stuntman and close friend of Errol Flynn – maintains that the arrow splitting stunt was carried out using an extra large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, My Days With Errol Flynn.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Curtiz | William Keighley","m_produced_by":"Hal B.
