{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On the morning of September 11, 2001, four al-Qaeda terrorists Ziad Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami, and Ahmed al-Haznawi pray in their New York hotel rooms before their upcoming suicide attack aboard United Airlines Flight 93. The quartet arrive at Newark Liberty International Airport passing through security without incident and wait at the gate with their future victims including Tom Burnett, Todd Beamer, Jeremy Glick and Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Mark Bingham narrowly arrives to board the doomed flight. After 40 minutes of delay due to traffic the plane takes off bound for San Francisco, with all 40 passengers and 4 terrorists on board. | Meanwhile, newly promoted FAA National Operations Manager Ben Sliney is in a meeting when it is reported that American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles has been hijacked after Mohamed Atta is overheard on the radio saying, \"We have some planes\". Minutes later the aircraft crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Much to Ben and his staff's horror, they learn that a second flight United Airlines Flight 175 also from Boston to Los Angeles, has been hijacked and after New York air traffic controllers attempt to contact the aircraft, it is seen live on CNN plowing into the South Tower of the World Trade Centre as reported that day. Ben and his staff realise they are dealing with several hijackings and orders the military to be on the lookout for American Airlines Flight 77, which is reported missing and presumed to have also been hijacked. | As United 93 reaches cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, an impatient Ahmed al-Nami demands to know from Jarrah why they are not yet hijacking the plane but Jarrah insists the time isn't right. After al-Haznawi returns from the lavatory wearing an artificial bomb around his torso, al-Ghamdi makes the first move and grabs hold of flight attendant Debbie Welsh at knifepoint. After a passenger is stabbed and the \"bomb\" is revealed causing mass panic among passengers, al-Nami & al-Haznawi force the first class passengers to the back of the plane. Meanwhile Jarrah and al-Ghamdi threaten Debbie and demand they be let into the cockpit, and despite the hijackers claims that no one will be hurt, both pilots as well as Debbie are stabbed to death allowing Jarrah to take over control as pilot. | Back on the ground Ben Sliney, still debating on what to do about the unfolding disaster, is in shock when American 77 crashes into the Pentagon and comes to a decision that all aircraft be grounded and planes are not to enter or leave US airspace until further notice. | Aboard United 93, Jarrah turns the plane, making some frightened passengers believe they are heading to an airport but they are in fact on course for Washington, D.C. After flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw notices the dead bodies of Debbie and the pilots, Jarrah flying at low altitude, and passengers learning from family members via airphone of the earlier attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon by hijacked aircraft, they conclude that their plane will too be used as a missile and decide to take action organizing a revolt against the hijackers, with passenger Donald Freeman Greene having had experience in flying. | After passengers arm themselves, pray and make final phone calls to loved ones, the group rush forward, beginning their counterattack. As al-Haznawi is overpowered by the passengers, he is killed by Mark Bingham who crushes Ahmed Al-Haznawi's skull with a fire extinguisher. Seeing this, al-Nami alerts Jarrah and al-Ghamdi in the cockpit of the ongoing assault. Jarrah shakes the plane violently to throw the passengers off balance, while al-Nami attempts hold off the advancing passengers using the food cart, pepper spray and fire extinguisher. Despite his vain attempts to delay the passengers, he too is overpowered and killed after having his neck snapped by Jeremy Glick. Seeing the passengers getting nearer, al-Ghamdi orders Jarrah to crash the plane, knowing they'll never reach their intended target. The passengers then breach the cockpit with the food cart, finally gain entrance into the cockpit, and battle both hijackers over the controls. As the passengers and hijackers struggle for control of the yoke, the plane plummets into a nosedive and goes upside down, crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and killing everyone on board.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"United 93 was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2006. James Berardinelli, Roger Ebert, Michael Medved, and Peter Travers all awarded it four stars on their rating scales, with Ebert calling the film \"masterful and heartbreaking\" and saying that it \"does honor to the memory of the victims.\"[22] Travers termed it \"one of the most moving films of the year\", in Rolling Stone. | The film holds a 91% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 203 reviews, with the consensus: \"Potent and sobering, United 93 is even more gut-wrenching because the outcome is already known. While difficult to watch, director Paul Greengrass' film has been made with skill and treats the subject matter with respect, never resorting to the aggrandizement of which Hollywood has sometimes been accused. Especially effective is the cast of mostly unknown actors, who portray the passengers of the doomed flight as ordinary people who respond with bravery to extraordinary circumstances.\"[23] | The film also has a score of 90 on Metacritic, where the film appears on 39 critics' top 10 lists, more than any other 2006 film on the site,[24] (although the 2006 film with the highest average score on the site is the re-released 1969 film Army of Shadows).[25][26] The film was ranked #1 on 47 lists (the most of any 2006 film).[27] | At the website Movie City News, which ranks 250 critics' lists and awards point values for list-placement, United 93 ranks as the #1 film of 2006[28][29][30] with a score of 917.5 points. | The film has been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2010 Maryland Film Festival. | Only two films (The Departed and The Queen) appeared on more top 10 lists of the best films of 2006 than United 93, and no film received more #1 mentions:[24] | Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal and Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it among the top ten best films of 2006.[24] | United 93 received numerous awards and nominations from film critics and guilds. Ultimately, the film received two Academy Award nominations, including Best Director, at the 79th Academy Awards, and six BAFTA Award nominations, including Best British Film, at the 60th British Academy Film Awards, winning two for Best Director and Best Film Editing.","m_production":"The film was the first Hollywood feature to draw its narrative directly from the September 11 attacks of 2001. Passengers were portrayed in the film mostly by professional, but relatively unknown, actors. (Tom Burnett, for instance, is played by Christian Clemenson, who has since appeared on Boston Legal and CSI: Miami). The roles of one of the flight attendants, the two pilots, and many other airline personnel were filled by actual airline employees.[citation needed] Some participants in the real-life events play themselves,[citation needed] notably FAA operations manager Ben Sliney.[citation needed] | The dialogue, which was mostly improvised during rehearsals Greengrass held with the cast, was based on face-to-face interviews between actors and relatives of those they portray. Almost none of the passengers in the film are referred to by their names. Their identities remain anonymous, emphasizing the group effort over any individual heroics (and portraying the fact that strangers on an airplane would not know each other's names). Much of the dialogue uses technical authenticity rather than theatrical embellishments, such as talk about whether a plane has \"Squawked 7500.\"[citation needed] | During production, the actors playing the flight's crew and passengers were lodged in separate hotels from the actors portraying the hijackers, and even ate their meals separately, ostensibly to create an air of antagonism in the film between the two groups.[citation needed] | Filming took place from October until December 2005, on a 20-year-old reclaimed Boeing 757 formerly operated by MyTravel Airways, at Pinewood Studios near London. The cockpit was built by Flightdeck solutions. The location was chosen both for its financial incentives and to shield actors from unwanted public scrutiny they might have received in the United States.[8] Action was filmed with handheld cameras, chosen for their versatility on the close-quarters sets and to create a sense of immediacy. Exterior airport sequences were shot on location at Newark Liberty International Airport, while interiors were shot back in England at London Stansted Airport. A few scenes were also shot in Washington, D.C. and Boston. Additionally, an opening sequence set in Afghanistan was shot in Morocco, but it was cut from the film before release.[9] | The title was changed from Flight 93 to United 93 in March 2006, to differentiate it from the A&E TV movie Flight 93.[citation needed] Shortly thereafter, the film was given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"language, and some intense sequences of terror and violence.\"[10] Universal Pictures' appeal of this rating was rejected.[citation needed] The film was released in the United States cinemas on April 28, 2006 and opened second in the weekend box office behind RV, but it netted a slightly higher per-screen average.[2] | Initial screenings ended with the closing credits line \"America's War on Terror had begun\". This was replaced in the release version with \"Dedicated to the memory of all those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001\".[11] | After trailers for the film began circulating in cinemas, there were calls for Universal Studios to pull them, due to the upset and surprise caused to some audience members.[12] Universal did not heed that call, although one theatre in Manhattan pulled the trailer after audience complaints.[6] | The Iraqi-born, London-based actor Sarmed al-Samarrai, who plays a hijacker in the film, was reportedly denied a visa by United States immigration authorities when he applied to visit New York City to attend the premiere, despite having already been granted asylum in the United Kingdom since the 1990s. The reason reported to have been given was that he had once been a conscripted member of the Iraqi Army — although this was also the grounds for his refugee status after his desertion in 1993.[13] Other sources say that he applied late for his visa and that it was not denied.[14]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Paul Greengrass","m_produced_by":"Paul Greengrass Tim Bevan Eric Fellner Lloyd Levin","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Christian Clemenson Cheyenne Jackson Peter Hermann Sarmed al-Samarrai David Alan Basche Khalid Abdalla","m_music_by":"John Powell","m_cinematography":"Barry Ackroyd","m_edited_by":"Clare Douglas Richard Pearson Christopher Rouse","m_production_company":"StudioCanal Working Title Films Sidney Kimmel Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures (United States) United International Pictures (International)","m_release_dates":"April 28, 2006 (2006-04-28) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States United Kingdom France","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$15 million[2]","m_box_office":"$76.3 million[2] | United 93 is a 2006 drama film written, co-produced and directed by Paul Greengrass, that chronicles events aboard United Airlines Flight 93,[3] which was hijacked during the September 11 attacks of 2001. The film attempts to recount with as much veracity as possible (there is a disclaimer that some imagination had to be used) and in real time (from the flight's takeoff) what has come to be known in the United States as a critical moment. According to the filmmakers, the film was made with the cooperation of all of the passengers' families.[4] | United 93 premiered on April 26, 2006 at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, a festival founded to celebrate New York City as a major filmmaking center and to contribute towards the long-term recovery of Lower Manhattan.[5] Several family members of the passengers aboard the flight attended the premiere to show their support. | The film opened in North America on April 28, 2006 to unanimous critical acclaim. Ten percent of the gross from the three-day opening weekend was promised toward a donation to create a memorial for the Flight 93 victims.[6] United 93 grossed $31.4 million in the United States, and $76.3 million worldwide.[2][7] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"UNITED 93 (15)\".
