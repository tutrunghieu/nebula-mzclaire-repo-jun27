They escaped from their village and came to Sarajevo in search of their aunt, which lived in the neighborhood called Bistrik. Hamza decided to help the boys by shielding them from the horrors of war. Together they fight for survival in this horrible war and the ongoing complete siege of the city. After a long search, Hamza discovers that the aunt of Adis and Kerim was a refugee in Germany. Upon learning this Hamza tries to save the kids by sending them out of the war zone. But the only way out was through the Sarajevo International Airport, which is a very dangerous passage occupied and monitored by Chetniks and their death squads as well as snipers. | In many scenes Hamza is seen with the two kids speaking monologues, while observing photos of his wife and daughter.
