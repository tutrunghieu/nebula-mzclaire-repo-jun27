{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Eleven-year-old Mark Sway and his little brother, Ricky, are smoking cigarettes in the woods near their home when they encounter Mob lawyer Jerome Clifford. Clifford tells Mark that he is about to kill himself to avoid being murdered by Barry \"The Blade\" Muldanno, the nephew of notorious mob kingpin Johnny Sulari. Ricky becomes catatonic after witnessing the suicide and is hospitalized. Authorities — and the Mob — realize that Clifford may have told Mark where a Louisiana senator who was murdered by Muldanno is buried. | Mark meets Regina \"Reggie\" Love, a lawyer and recovering alcoholic, who agrees to represent him. They quickly run afoul of \"Reverend\" Roy Foltrigg, a celebrated and vain United States Attorney who is using the case as a springboard for his political ambitions. In the meantime, it is revealed that Sulari never authorized Muldanno to kill the senator and wants Muldanno to uncover how much the boys know. Muldanno is also ordered to move the body, but currently he is unable to because it is buried in Clifford's boathouse, and police are still on the property investigating his suicide. | Foltrigg continues to use legal means to get Mark to reveal where the body is hidden, while Sulari orders Muldanno to kill the children and Reggie. He also orders the body to be moved once the investigation at Clifford's home is concluded. Mark is threatened in a hospital elevator by a member of the Mafia, and is unable to talk to Foltrigg. | Mark and Reggie go to New Orleans to confirm that the body is on Clifford's property. Reggie intends to use this information to broker a deal with Foltrigg to get Ricky specialized medical care and place the family in the witness protection program. Reggie and Mark arrive at Clifford's house the same night as Muldanno and his accomplices. They are digging up the body, but a melee follows when Mark and Reggie are discovered. Muldanno and the others flee after Reggie trips the neighbors' alarm. | Foltrigg agrees to Reggie's demands in exchange for information about the body's location. Before the Sway family leaves to restart their lives under new identities, Mark and Reggie share a heartfelt goodbye. Although not explicitly stated, Sulari has had enough of Muldanno and intends to have his nephew killed. With the body recovered, Foltrigg is a lock-in for the media headlines he craves, and mentions that he intends to run for governor.","m_cast":"Susan Sarandon as Regina \"Reggie\" Love | Tommy Lee Jones as \"Reverend\" Roy Foltrigg | Brad Renfro as Mark Sway | Mary-Louise Parker as Dianne Sway | David Speck as Ricky Sway | Anthony LaPaglia as Barry \"The Blade\" Muldanno | J.
