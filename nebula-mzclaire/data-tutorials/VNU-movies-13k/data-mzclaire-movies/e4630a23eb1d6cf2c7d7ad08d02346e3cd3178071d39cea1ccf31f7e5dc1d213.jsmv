{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Vincent MacKenna (Bill Murray) is a Vietnam War veteran and retiree living in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. He is a grumpy alcoholic who smokes and gambles regularly. His wife, Sandy (Donna Mitchell), developed Alzheimer's Disease years ago and can no longer recognize him, but he still does her laundry at a nursing home where she lives and visits her weekly, posing as a doctor. Vincent's only other close friends are a pregnant Eastern European sex worker named Daka (Naomi Watts) and his cat, Felix. He owes many people money. Despite his aggressive attitude toward strangers, Vincent does have acquaintances who admire and care about him. | Vincent's 30-year-old Chrysler Lebaron gets damaged by a tree branch felled by his new neighbors' moving van. Maggie Bronstein (Melissa McCarthy) and her 12-year-old son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) meet Vincent, who demands payment for the damage. Maggie is a single mother fighting for custody after her husband had several affairs. She is a medical technician doing her best to provide for Oliver, who is ostracised and bullied at his Catholic school, but is a knowledgeable and friendly boy, welcomed warmly by his new teacher (Chris O'Dowd). On his first day at his school, Oliver's phone, wallet and house keys are stolen from his gym locker. Oliver asks Vincent if he can stay at his home until his mother comes home from work. Vincent offers to continue babysitting for a fee. | Vincent picks up Oliver every day after school because Maggie often has to work late hours. Vincent's ideas of after-school activities involve visits to racetracks and bars. The mismatched pair begin to help each other mature. Vincent teaches Oliver how to defend himself, resulting in Oliver breaking the bully's nose. The two soon become best friends. Vincent and Oliver win a lucky bet at the track, enabling Vincent to pay off some of his debts. But he gambles away the rest of his money, hoping to make more to keep Sandy in her nursing home, where he is behind on payments. Vincent is confronted in his home by loan sharks Zucko (Terrence Howard) and Antwan (James Andrew O'Connor), who attempt to take Sandy's jewelry. Vincent suffers a stroke and Zucko and Antwan leave him on the floor. | Vincent now needs hospitalization and physical therapy. Oliver, Maggie and Daka help Vincent to recover. He becomes irritable and depressed after finding out that his wife has died while he was hospitalized, due to the nursing home being unable to reach him. Oliver's father (Scott Adsit), a lawyer, finds out where Vincent has been taking the boy and uses this to get joint custody with supervision. Vincent is told that he can no longer see Oliver. The boy won't give up on him, choosing Vincent as his hero for a \"Saints Among Us\" project for his school. He interviews everyone who knows Vincent and compiles his life story, volunteering Vincent as his saint. Daka has her baby and the film ends with all of them at Vincent's house, happily eating together.","m_cast":"Bill Murray as Vincent MacKenna | Melissa McCarthy as Maggie Bronstein | Jaeden Lieberher as Oliver Bronstein | Naomi Watts as Daka Paramova | Chris O'Dowd as Brother Geraghty | Kimberly Quinn as Ana | Donna Mitchell as Sandy | Terrence Howard as Zucko | Dario Barosso as Robert Ocinski | Ray Iannicelli as Roger | Scott Adsit as David | Nate Corddry as Terry","m_reception":"St. Vincent received generally positive reviews from critics.
