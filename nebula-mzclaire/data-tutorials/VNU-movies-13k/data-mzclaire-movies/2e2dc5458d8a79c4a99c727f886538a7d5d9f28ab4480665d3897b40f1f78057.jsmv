{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1943, Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu (Clifton Webb) comes up with a scheme to deceive the Nazis about the impending invasion of southern Europe. It entails releasing a dead body just off the coast of Spain, where strong currents will almost certainly cause it to drift ashore in an area where a skilled German secret agent is known to operate. The corpse will appear to be the victim of an airplane crash, the non-existent Royal Marine Major William Martin, who is carrying letters that describe a forthcoming Allied invasion of Greece, rather than the obvious target of Sicily. Time is short, but the impatient Montagu is finally given approval to carry out the mission. | On the advice of a medical expert, Montagu procures the body of a man who died of pneumonia (so that he will seem to have drowned) from the grieving father. Then, after proper preparations, he and his assistant, Lt. Acres (Robert Flemyng), take the corpse (concealed in a canister) to a waiting submarine. The submarine evades a depth-charge attack and later surfaces at night to release the body. As hoped, it washes ashore. Montagu is at first disappointed when it appears that the documents were not tampered with, but an expert assures him one of the letters was cleverly opened and resealed. | Hitler is convinced the document is genuine, but the German officer in charge of intelligence is skeptical. He orders an IRA Nazi spy Patrick O'Reilly (Stephen Boyd) dispatched to London to investigate. What he uncovers is inconclusive, in his mind, until he checks out Martin's \"fiancée\", Lucy Sherwood (Gloria Grahame). She is actually the roommate of Montagu's assistant, Pam (Josephine Griffin). O'Reilly shows up at their flat, posing as Martin's friend. By chance, Lucy has that same day received news that her real boyfriend has been killed in action, so her genuine grief mostly convinces O'Reilly. As a final test, however, he leaves the address of his lodgings with her, telling her to contact him if she needs anything. He then radios his superiors to expect a message from him in an hour, then waits to see if British counterintelligence comes for him. Montagu almost makes a mistake, but realises in time why O'Reilly left his address and, with some difficulty, convinces his superior to order that O'Reilly be left alone. Convinced, the Germans transfer some of their forces to Greece. | After the war, Montagu leaves a medal he was awarded at the grave of the man who never was.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film earned an estimated $1.1 million in North American rentals in 1956.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Man Who Never Was (1953 book)","m_directed_by":"Ronald Neame","m_produced_by":"André Hakim","m_screenplay_by":"Nigel Balchin","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Clifton Webb Gloria Grahame Robert Flemyng","m_music_by":"Alan Rawsthorne","m_cinematography":"Oswald Morris","m_edited_by":"Peter Taylor","m_production_company":"Sumar Productions","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"15 March 1956 (1956-03-15) (London)","m_running_time":"103 min.","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Man Who Never Was is a 1956 Second World War film, based on the book of the same name by Lt.
