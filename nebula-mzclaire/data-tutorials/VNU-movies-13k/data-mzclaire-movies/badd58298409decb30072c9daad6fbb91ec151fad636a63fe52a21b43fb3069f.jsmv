Before the plane slides into a gorge the group is rescued by Tarzan (Gordon Scott), who undertakes to lead them back to civilization. | Diana is kidnapped by warriors from Opar under Chief Ogonooro (Orlando Martins). The Oparians desire the strangers as sacrifices for their lion god. She is recovered by Tarzan and hunter Tusker Hawkins (Robert Beatty), whose advances Diana rebuffs. Secretly, however, Hawkins is in league with the Oparians, and plans to sell the castaways to the natives for a fortune in ivory. | Tarzan, rightly suspecting Hawkins' untrustworthiness, exposes his treachery. Now openly in league with the natives, the hunter helps them take the white party captive in Tarzan's absence. The ape man returns to save them before the sacrifice can take place, aided by his chimpanzee ally Cheeta, who sets fire to the native village. He then leads them to the safety of a nearby settlement. Hawkins meets his fate at the hands of the Oparians, to whom Tarzan has signaled his double-dealing by a creative use of jungle drums.","m_cast":"Gordon Scott as Tarzan | Robert Beatty as Tusker Hawkins | Yolande Donlan as Gamage Dean | Betta St. John as Diana Penrod | Wilfrid Hyde-White as 'Doodles' Fletcher (as Wilfrid Hyde White) | George Coulouris as Carl Kraski | Peter Arne as Dick Penrod | Orlando Martins as Oparian Chieftain Ogonoore","m_reception":"According to MGM records the film earned $915,000 in the US and Canada and $1.4 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $432,000.[1]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters created  by Edgar Rice Burroughs","m_directed_by":"Bruce Humberstone","m_produced_by":"John Croydon Sol Lesser","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Gordon Scott Robert Beatty Yolande Donlan Betta St. John","m_music_by":"Clifton Parker","m_cinematography":"C.M.
