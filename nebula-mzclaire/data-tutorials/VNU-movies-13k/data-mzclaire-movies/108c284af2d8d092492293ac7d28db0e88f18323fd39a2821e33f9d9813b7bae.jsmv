{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set at the fictional Camden College in New Hampshire, the film opens at the \"End of the World\" party, where students Lauren Hynde, Paul Denton, and Sean Bateman give apathetic interior monologues on their lives and briefly exchange glances with one another. Lauren, previously a virgin, takes a film student upstairs to have sex, only to wake up being raped by a townie while the film student records it; upon waking, she reflects on how she had planned to lose her virginity to Victor, her now ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Paul tries to have sex with a jock, only to be bashed when it turns out he is deeply closeted; additionally, a bruised and beaten Sean tears up a purple letter, before approaching and having sex with a blonde girl at the party. | The plot then moves backwards several months and explores the love triangle between Lauren, Paul, and Sean. Misinterpreting Sean's friendliness, Paul mistakes him for a homosexual and makes several advances to which Sean is apparently oblivious. Concurrently, Lauren also finds herself attracted to Sean despite saving her virginity for her traveling boyfriend, Victor. Sean reciprocates her feelings, and assumes the anonymous, purple love letters he has started receiving are from her. | While Paul is visiting his friend \"Dick\", Sean is seduced by Lauren's roommate Lara, who tells him that Lauren isn't interested in him because she has a boyfriend; despite having sex with Lara, however, Sean regrets it and realizes that he is in love with Lauren. It is then revealed that another, unnamed cafeteria girl is the author of Sean's love letters; after seeing him leave the party with Lara, she sends him a suicide note before cutting her wrists in the dorm bathtub. Lauren, finding Sean with Lara, runs to the girls bathroom in anger, only to find the unnamed girl's corpse, leaving Lauren extremely distressed. Sean, still believing Lauren wrote the purple letters, misinterprets the suicide note and assumes Lauren never wants to be with him. | After numerous failed attempts at suicide, Sean then fakes his death and, unaware that Lauren recently found a corpse, unintentionally upsets her further when she finds him pretending to be dead. After stealing drugs from dealer Rupert, Sean tries to speak to Lauren again, only for her to brush him off angrily. Finally happy now that Victor has returned to Camden College, Lauren is completely distraught to find Victor has no idea who she is. | Paul, upon finding a drunk Sean, tries to talk to him, only for Sean to reject him, causing Paul to run off upset. Sean then finds that the love notes have stopped, and is beaten by Rupert and Rupert's Jamaican partner, Guest. The protagonists then attend the \"End of the World\" party and the plot returns to the introduction. After seeing Lauren heading upstairs with the filmmaker, Sean finally accepts he cannot be with her, and tears up one of the purple letters he believes to be from her. It's then revealed that, rather than having sex with the blonde girl as he does in the intro, Sean was merely fantasizing, and he instead leaves his drink and exits. Paul and Lauren then meet on the house porch and reflect on the events of the movie and on Sean, who is seen leaving on a motorcycle. Sean then begins narrating his thoughts, only for them to end prematurely.","m_cast":"James van der Beek as Sean Bateman, a drug dealer.

Where Mary Harron re-invented American Psycho as an elegant comic horror film, Roger Avary, who wrote and directed The Rules of Attraction, dives headlong into the depravity roiling in the student body of the fictional Camden College. Where Ms. Harron shrewdly created a surreal, high-styled ambiance for Mr. Ellis's monstrous humanoids to rattle around in, Mr. Avary wants to convince us that his movie's dissipated symbols of late capitalist excess really exist. The harder the movie tries to shock, the shriller it rings.\"[9] Richard Corliss characterized the film as a \"frenetically chic look at a daisy chain of collegiate craving...Sex, drugs and rack 'n' ruin; pretty people doing nasty things to one another...honestly, what more could you want in a movie?\".[10] | Bret Easton Ellis has said, \"My favorite movie out of the four was The Rules of Attraction. I thought it was the only one that captured the sensibility of the novel in a cinematic way. I know I'm sounding like a film critic on that, but I'm talking about that in an emotional way—as the writer of the novel. I watched that movie and thought they got it in a way that Mary Harron [director of American Psycho] didn't and Less Than Zero didn't.\"[11] | The film grossed $11,819,244 worldwide on a budget of $4 million, thus making the film a minor box office success.[2] | At the 14th GLAAD Media Awards, the film was nominated for Best Film—Wide Release by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, losing to The Hours. | Though the film has inspired mixed critical reaction, it has become something of a cult classic, which was covered by The A.V. Club for their \"New Cult Canon\" feature.[12] In 2012 Entertainment Weekly cited the film as one of the \"50 Best Movies You've Never Seen\".[13] In an April 2009 interview, author Ellis stated that the film adaptation of The Rules of Attraction came closest of all the movies based on his books to capturing his sensibility and recreating the world he created in his novels.[14] On Friday April 24, 2009, the film was shown on Film4 as part of the \"Great Adaptations\" series.[citation needed]","m_production":"The film was shot at the University of Redlands in California.[3] | The film was one of the first studio motion pictures to be edited using Final Cut Pro. Using a beta version of FCP 3, it demonstrated to the film industry that successful 3:2 pulldown matchback to 24fps could be achieved with an off-the-shelf product. Roger Avary, the film's director, became a spokesperson for FCP, appearing in print ads worldwide.[4][5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Rules of Attraction  by Bret Easton Ellis","m_directed_by":"Roger Avary","m_produced_by":"Roger Avary Greg Shapiro","m_screenplay_by":"Roger Avary","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"James van der Beek, Shannyn Sossamon, Ian Somerhalder, Kip Pardue","m_music_by":"tomandandy","m_cinematography":"Robert Brinkmann","m_edited_by":"Sharon Rutter","m_production_company":"Kinsgate Films Roger Avary Filmproduktion","m_distributed_by":"Lions Gate Films","m_release_dates":"October 11, 2002 (2002-10-11) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States Germany","m_language":"English German","m_budget":"$4 million[2]","m_box_office":"$11,819,244[2] | The Rules of Attraction is a 2002 black comedy film written and directed by Roger Avary, based on the novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis.
