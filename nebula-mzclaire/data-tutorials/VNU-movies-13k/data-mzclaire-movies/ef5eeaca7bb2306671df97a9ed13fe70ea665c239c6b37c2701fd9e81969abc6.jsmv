It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.[1] The film is currently not in distribution. | The film depicts the Cheka executions during the Russian Civil War (1917–1923) through the eyes of a senior officer of the Cheka in a small Russian town. Most of the film is taken up by the unrelenting and merciless series of executions, carried out in the basement of a slaughterhouse. We also see lightning interrogations and dozens of summary death sentences pronounced by Chekist troikas. | Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film Festival, said of the film: | \"Rogozhkin eventually penetrates into the psychotic mind of the Chekist with a moment of sublime insight, reminiscent of Bertolucci's equally disturbing portrait of the fascist killer in The Conformist. The Chekist is an overwhelming cry in the face of such madness.\"[2]","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Tchekiste\" [The Chekist].
