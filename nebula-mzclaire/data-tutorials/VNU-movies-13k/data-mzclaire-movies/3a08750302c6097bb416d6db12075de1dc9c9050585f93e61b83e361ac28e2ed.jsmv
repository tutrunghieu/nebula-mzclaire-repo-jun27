{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During the 2012–13 uprisings in Egypt, an archaeological team discovers a vast pyramid buried 600 feet (180 m) below the surface. Further examinations of the pyramid's apex reveals that the structure is three-sided, unlike any pyramid previously discovered. They locate a tunnel leading into the apex of the pyramid. While breaking into the opening, toxic air is released poisoning a worker. Soon after, Egyptian authorities order the team to leave the site because of a violent uprising in nearby Giza. Team leader Dr. Miles Holden (O'Hare) and his daughter Nora argue over whether to obey the order. They eventually agree to send in a remotely-controlled rover vehicle – named Shorty – to enter the pyramid and document its interior. | While examining a small portion of the structure, Shorty is attacked by an unknown creature and goes offline. The portion of the team that has remained at the site decide to enter the pyramid to recover Shorty. After finding only a piece of the rover, they discover the wire tracing their way back out was cut. Realizing they may be lost, they enter a room with an unstable floor that collapses beneath them. Team member Zahir (Amir K) is wounded by the falling debris which pins his leg to the floor. Sunni (Nicola), another team member, attempts to climb up a small opening but is attacked by a creature hidden at the top and falls back down. Forced to leave Zahir behind, they look for another way out. Within moments, they hear Zahir scream and return to find only a bloody trail leading up the wall. | They are pursued through a narrow tunnel by a pack of the creatures Sunni encountered, which have a cat-like appearance. An Egyptian soldier who found another way into the pyramid finds and rescues them in time pulling them out of the tunnel. After killing a few of the creatures, he peers into the tunnel and is suddenly seized, being pulled inside snapping his back in the process, while the others watch in horror. Left to fend on their own, the team stumbles into a sand trap but manages to escape. During the chaos, however, Sunni falls into a spike pit and dies shortly after landing on a spike. | Forced to keep moving, the team finds a burial chamber which contains the corpse of a Freemason explorer who had been trapped in the pyramid in the late 19th century. A journal he left behind details a possible escape route from the burial chamber. Dr. Holden suddenly has his heart torn out from behind by a large creature. Nora and the team's cameraman Fitzie (Buckley) flee, but return after realizing they're trapped. They discover the creature is the Egyptian god Anubis, who is seen weighing Miles' heart in an ancient ritual to determine his worthiness to enter the afterlife. He's deemed unworthy and crumbles to dust when Anubis eats his heart. | After Anubis leaves, Nora and Fitzie decipher hieroglyphs in the chamber that indicate the pyramid was constructed to imprison Anubis, who is seeking to reunite with his creator, Osiris. They find an air shaft with a ladder left behind by the soldier Shadid, but Anubis sees and pursues them. Nora climbs first and Fitzie follows, but midway up the ladder he is grabbed from below and dragged to his death. Now alone, Nora continues to scramble up the crumbling ladder and reaches the top but is captured by Anubis. Tied to an obelisk, she uses a blade hidden in her hand to slowly cut through her bonds before Anubis can finish his ritual. Once free, she slashes and wounds Anubis, who is then attacked by a horde of scavenger cats allowing Nora to escape. Exhausted and traumatized, she finally climbs her way to freedom and collapses just before clearing the pyramid's exit. She awakens sunburned and injured, only to discover an Egyptian child playing with her camera. As she pleas for his help, Anubis suddenly appears from the dark lunging at them both as the picture goes black.","m_cast":"Ashley Hinshaw as Dr. Nora Holden | Denis O'Hare as Dr. Miles Holden | James Buckley as Terry \"Fitzie\" Fitsimmons | Christa-Marie Nicola as Sunni Marsh | Amir K as Michael Zahir | Joseph Beddelem as Taxi driver | Garsha Arristos as Egyptian Worker | Omar Benbrahim as Chubby Intern | Philip Shelley as The Provost | Faycal Attougui as Shadid","m_reception":"The Pyramid received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, with Moviefone and CraveOnline both naming it one of the worst films of 2014.[9][10] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 13%, based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 2.8/10.
