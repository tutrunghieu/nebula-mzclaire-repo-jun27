Hopper said of Johnson that \"He says he's not going to do anything for this picture until he reads the reviews.\"[12] Johnson claims that he was unable to do promotion because he was shooting the film Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man with Mickey Rourke.[12] Of Madsen, Hopper claimed that she \"was very embarrassed\" by the amount of her on-screen nudity.[13] The film was released on October 12, 1990, in 23 theaters, grossing USD $112,188 in its opening weekend. The film grossed only $1.2 million in the North America, far less than the cost of its production.[14] | The Hot Spot received generally positive reviews from critics and currently has a 71% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"Only movie lovers who have marinated their imaginations in the great B movies from RKO and Republic will recognize The Hot Spot as a superior work in an old tradition.\"[15] In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \"Mr. Hopper's direction is tough and stylish, in effective contrast with the sunny look of Ueli Steiger's cinematography.\"[16] USA Today gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"In other words, Hopper's direction isn't any great shakes, and the wrap-up is somewhat confusing, but this film does make you want to go skinny-dipping with someone else's mate.\"[17] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, \"Hot Spot will never go down as timeless, neoclassic noir. But, with its Hopperlike moments, over-the-top performances and infectious music, it carries you along for a spell.\"[18] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"Hopper still hasn't learned how to pace a movie, but working from Charles Williams' 1952 novel Hell Hath No Fury he comes up with a reasonably diverting hothouse yarn.\"[19]","m_production":"Charles Williams wrote a screenplay version of his own novel with Nona Tyson in 1962.[2] It was intended for Robert Mitchum. Many years later, Dennis Hopper found the script and updated it.[2] The director described the film as \"Last Tango in Texas. Real hot, steamy stuff\".[3] | A bedroom scene originally called for Madsen to appear naked, but she decided to put on a negligee because she felt that, \"Not only was the nudity weak storywise, but it didn't let the audience undress her\".[4] Hopper later admitted that Madsen was right.[4] | The director gave his impressions of working with Johnson: | He wasn't that bad. He has a lot of people with him. He came on to this film with two bodyguards, a cook, a trainer, ah let's see, a helicopter pilot he comes to and from the set in a helicopter, very glamorous let's see, two drivers, a secretary, and, oh yes, his own hair person, his own make-up person, his own wardrobe person. So when he walks to the set he has five people with him.[5] | Johnson found Hopper's approach to filmmaking \"a little disappointing, I gotta tell you\".[6] He later recalled: | Mike Figgis had written a script called The Hot Spot, and it was a heist movie. Three days before we started shooting, Dennis Hopper came to all of us, he called a meeting on a Sunday, and he said, “Okay, we’re not making that script. We’re making this one.” And he passed a script around the table that had been written for Robert Mitchum in the ’60s… or maybe it was the ’50s… and it was based on a book called Hell Hath No Fury. And that was the movie that we ended up making. This was three days before we started shooting! So he was kind of looking around the table at everybody and saying, “Well, you know, if Don Johnson bails, we don’t have a movie.” [Laughs.] And I read the script, and I said, “Wow!” I mean, the Figgis script was really slick and cool, and it was a heist movie, but this was real noir, the guy was an amoral drifter, and it was all about how women were going to take him down.[7] | Hopper shot the film on location in Texas during what he described as the \"hottest, steamiest weather you could imagine\". The primary locations were in Taylor, Texas, especially its iconic downtown area,[8] locations around and in Austin as well as in Luling.[9] The swimming scenes were filmed at the famous Hamilton Pool Preserve west of Austin.[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Dennis Hopper","m_produced_by":"Paul Lewis","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Don Johnson | Virginia Madsen | Jennifer Connelly | Charles Martin Smith","m_music_by":"Jack Nitzsche","m_cinematography":"Ueli Steiger","m_edited_by":"Wende Phifer Mate","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 8, 1990 (1990-09-08) (Toronto Film Festival) | October 12, 1990 (1990-10-12) (general) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"130 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$1,293,976 | The Hot Spot is a 1990 American neo-noir film directed by Dennis Hopper and based on the 1952 book Hell Hath No Fury by Charles Williams.
