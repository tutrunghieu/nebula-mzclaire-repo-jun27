{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In October 1973, Control, head of British intelligence (\"the Circus\"), sends Jim Prideaux to Budapest to meet a Hungarian general (Operation Testify). Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. | Sir Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operation—\"Witchcraft\"—to obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. | Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy thought to have defected, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus. Control had suspected this, as well. Smiley chooses Peter Guillam and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attaché in London, was a spy. | Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. | Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service. Prideaux says the purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects \"Tinker\" (Alleline), \"Tailor\" (Haydon), \"Soldier\" (Bland), \"Poorman\" (Esterhase), and \"Beggarman\" (Smiley himself). \"Sailor\" was omitted from the nursery rhyme canon as it sounded too much like Tailor, should a poor communications link be used to return the information. | Smiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov — the \"Witchcraft\" source — at a safe house, where Polyakov gives them supposedly high-grade Soviet intelligence in exchange for low-grade British material, to help him maintain his cover with the Soviets. However, the mole is passing substantive material, including US intelligence, to Polyakov, his handler, whilst Polyakov's material has just enough substance to persuade the CIA to share information with the British. | Smiley tries to ascertain the location of the meetings between the British agents and Polyakov, but cannot persuade the government minister to reveal this information, as Witchcraft is buying the British too much favour with the USA. He therefore blackmails the information out of Esterhase, whose exile status makes him vulnerable to deportation. Smiley then has Tarr appear at the Paris office, implying he knows who the mole is. The mole meets Polyakov at the safe house, where Smiley arrests him. The mole is Haydon. The Circus plans to exchange Haydon with the Soviets, but he is killed by Prideaux, who was implicitly Haydon's former lover, and who had been betrayed by Haydon in Operation Testify. Smiley returns to the Circus as its chief.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The project was initiated by Peter Morgan when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce. Morgan dropped out as the writer for personal reasons but still served as an executive producer.[2] Following Morgan's departure as writer, Working Title hired Peter Straughan and his wife, Bridget O'Connor, to redraft the script. Park Chan-wook considered directing the film, but ultimately turned it down.[3] Tomas Alfredson was confirmed to direct on 9 July 2009. The production is his first English language film.[4][5] The film was backed financially by France's StudioCanal and had a budget corresponding to $21 million.[6] The film is dedicated to O'Connor, who died of cancer during production. | The director cast Gary Oldman in the role of George Smiley, and described the actor as having \"a great face\" and \"the quiet intensity and intelligence that's needed\". Many actors were connected to the other roles at various points, but only days before filming started, Oldman was still the only lead actor who officially had been contracted.[7] David Thewlis was in talks for a role early on.[8] Michael Fassbender was in talks at one point to star as Ricki Tarr, but the shooting schedule conflicted with his work on X-Men: First Class; Tom Hardy was cast instead.[9] On 17 September 2010, Mark Strong was confirmed to have joined the cast.[10] Jared Harris was cast but had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows; he was replaced by Toby Jones.[11] John le Carré appears in a cameo as a guest in a party scene.[12] | Principal photography took place between 7 October and 22 December 2010.[13] Studio scenes were shot at a former army barracks in Mill Hill, North London.[6] Blythe House in Kensington Olympia, West London, was used as the exterior for \"The Circus.\"[14] The interior hall of Budapest's Párizsi Udvar served as the location for the café scene, in which Jim Prideaux is shot.[15] Empress Coach Works in Haggerston was used as the location for the Merlin safe house. Other scenes were filmed on Hampstead Heath and in Hampstead Ponds, where Smiley is shown swimming, and in the physics department of Imperial College London. The exterior shots of the Islay Hotel, a run-down hotel described in the film as being near Liverpool Street station, which Smiley uses as a base, were shot in Wilkin Street, London NW5.[citation needed] | The events which take place in Czechoslovakia in the novel were moved to Hungary, because of the country's 20% rebate for film productions. The teams filmed in Budapest for five days. Right before Christmas, the team also filmed in Istanbul for nine days.[6] The production reunited Alfredson with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and editor Dino Jonsäter, with whom he had made his previous film Let the Right One In.[16] | The film took six months to edit. The final song in the film, Julio Iglesias' rendition of the French song \"La Mer\", set against a visual montage of various characters and subplots being resolved as Smiley strides into Circus headquarters to assume command, was chosen because it was something the team thought George Smiley would listen to when he was alone; Alfredson described the song as \"everything that the world of MI6 isn't\". A scene where Smiley listens to the song was filmed, but eventually cut to avoid giving it too much significance.[17][18] | Heard at a Circus office party, sung along to by the guests, is \"The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World\", composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, and performed by Sammy Davis, Jr., from the British spy spoof Licensed to Kill (1965).","m_sequel":"While doing press for Working Title's Les Misérables film adaptation, producer Eric Fellner stated that fellow producer Tim Bevan was working with writer Straughan and director Alfredson on developing a sequel to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Fellner did not specify whether or not the sequel would be based on The Honourable Schoolboy or Smiley's People, the two remaining Smiley novels in Le Carré's Karla trilogy.[44] While doing press for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014, Oldman stated that talk of a sequel, an adaptation of Smiley's People, had since dissapated; while also stressing that he would still like to see the film produced.[45]","m_based_on":"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy  by John le Carré","m_directed_by":"Tomas Alfredson","m_produced_by":"Tim Bevan Eric Fellner Robyn Slovo","m_screenplay_by":"Bridget O'Connor Peter Straughan","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Gary Oldman Colin Firth Tom Hardy John Hurt Toby Jones Mark Strong Benedict Cumberbatch Ciarán Hinds","m_music_by":"Alberto Iglesias","m_cinematography":"Hoyte van Hoytema","m_edited_by":"Dino Jonsäter","m_production_company":"StudioCanal Karla Films Paradis Films Kinowelt Filmproduktion Canal+ CinéCinéma Working Title","m_distributed_by":"Focus Features","m_release_dates":"5 September 2011 (2011-09-05) (Venice Film Festival) | 16 September 2011 (2011-09-16) (United Kingdom) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"127 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom France Germany","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$21 million","m_box_office":"$80,630,608[1] | Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a 2011 Cold War espionage film directed by Tomas Alfredson.
