{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In April 1957, engineer Walter Faber (Sam Shepard) is waiting to board a flight from Caracas, Venezuela to New York City when he meets a German, Herbert Hencke (Dieter Kirchlechner), who reminds him of an old friend. Before takeoff, Walter decides not to board the airplane, but when a flight attendant discovers him still in the terminal, she escorts him aboard. During the flight, the airplane develops engine trouble and crash lands in the desert near the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains. | While the passengers and crew wait to be rescued, Walter discovers that Herbert Hencke is the brother of his old friend, Joachim (August Zirner), whom Walter has not seen since he left Zürich, Switzerland, twenty years ago. He also learns that Joachim married Walter's former girlfriend Hannah (Barbara Sukowa), that they had a child together, and that they are now divorced. After writing a letter to his current married girlfriend, Ivy, ending their relationship, Walter thinks back on his days in Zurich falling in love with Hannah. He remembers proposing marriage to her after she revealed she was pregnant, and that she refused, saying she would terminate the pregnancy. | The passengers and crew are rescued and brought to Mexico City, where Herbert prepares to continue on to see his brother Joachim at his tobacco farm in Guatemala. Walter decides to accompany Herbert to see his old friend again. The journey is long and difficult. When the two finally arrive at the tobacco farm, they find Joachim has hanged himself. | Back in New York City, Walter returns to his apartment, only to find Ivy waiting for him. She received Walter's letter ending their relationship, but simply does not acknowledge it. Needing to escape, he decides to leave for his Paris business trip a week early and take an ocean liner rather than fly. Feeling he has \"started a new life\" aboard the ship, Walter meets a beautiful young woman, Elisabeth Piper (Julie Delpy), whom he begins to call Sabeth. They spend time together, playing ping-pong, exploring the ship, and falling in love. On the last night of the voyage, Walter asks her to marry him, but she does not know how to respond, and they part without saying goodbye. | In Paris, Walter looks for Sabeth at the Louvre and they reunite. He offers to drive her to Rome, rather than have her hitchhike as she's planned, and she agrees. They drive south through France and stop for the night at a hotel near Avignon. Late in the evening, Sabeth comes to Walter's room and they make love. They continue on their way through France and Italy, stopping at Florence and Orvieto before arriving in Rome. At Palatine Hill, Walter is captivated by the sculpture, Head of a Sleeping Girl. Walter learns that Sabeth is the daughter of his former girlfriend, Hannah—and possibly his own daughter. He becomes distant and refuses to tell Sabeth of what he suspects; Sabeth is upset with Walter's sudden unexplained strange behavior. Walter finally reveals to Sabeth that he knew her mother and father in Zurich in the 1930s. | Walter and Sabeth make their way to Greece, but Walter is troubled by the possibility that Sabeth may be his daughter. They sleep under the stars on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and at sunrise Walter goes for a swim. While sleeping, Sabeth is bitten by a snake, jumps up in alarm, and falls, hitting her head on a rock. Walter rushes her to a hospital in Athens. Hannah arrives to look after her daughter. | While Sabeth is treated at the hospital, Walter stays with Hannah at her house, recounting how he met Sabeth on the ship and how they travelled through Europe together. Hannah reveals that Sabeth is his daughter and asks him, \"Walter, how far did you go with the child?\" Devastated, Walter acknowledges he had sexual relations with her. Sabeth recovers from the snake bite and appears to be gaining strength, but suddenly dies from the head injury. | In June 1957, at the Athens Airport, Hannah and Walter embrace and say goodbye. Walter sits dejected in the airport terminal. When his flight is called, he remains seated, pondering his fate and existence.[3]","m_cast":"Sam Shepard as Walter Faber | Julie Delpy as Sabeth | Barbara Sukowa as Hannah | Dieter Kirchlechner as Herbert Hencke | Traci Lind as Charlene | Deborra-Lee Furness as Ivy | August Zirner as Joachim Hencke | Thomas Heinze as Kurt | Bill Dunn as Lewin | Peter Berling as Baptist | Lorna Farrar as Arlette | Kathleen Matiezen as Lady Stenographer | Lou Cutell as New York Doorman | Charley Hayward as Joe | Irwin Wynn as Dick | Warwick Shaw as 2nd officer[1]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Voyager is based on the 1957 novel Homo Faber by Swiss author Max Frisch, who wrote the novel as a reflection on his country's complex role during World War II. Frisch saw parallels between Switzerland's neutrality during the war and the thoughtlessness and casual neglect of the Swiss engineer toward the young Jewish woman, who bears his child on the eve of the war. The main character shows some resemblance to Frisch, a frustrated architect turned author.[4] | German director Volker Schlöndorff, who already directed an Oscar-winning film, \"The Tin Drum\" (1979), moved to New York in the mid-1980s to make a television adaptation of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman as Willy Loman. By 1987, with his career stalled and his marriage breaking up, the 47-year-old Schlöndorff could perhaps identify with the novel's main character, Walter Faber, and he decided to make a film based on the novel.[4] | After acquiring the film rights, Schlöndorff turned to Rudy Wurlitzer, who had written numerous screenplays, including Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), and Walker (1987). Wurlitzer and Schlöndorff made several important changes for the screenplay. The story became less a political morality tale than a haunting narrative of personal destruction.[4] While retaining the European settings and supporting characters, he changed the nationality of the protagonist, transforming Walter Faber into an American engineer. During the screenplay's development, Schlondorff visited Max Frisch at his Munich apartment, seeking out and receiving the author's guidance and approval for the significant changes being made to his story.[4] | Voyager was filmed in the following locations: | Blythe Airport, California, USA[5] | Germany | Greece | Mexico | New York City, New York, USA | Paris, France | Perugia, Umbria, Italy | Rome, Lazio, Italy | RMS Queen Mary[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Homo Faber  by Max Frisch","m_directed_by":"Volker Schlöndorff","m_produced_by":"Eberhard Junkersdorf","m_screenplay_by":"Rudy Wurlitzer","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sam Shepard","m_music_by":"Stanley Myers","m_cinematography":"Giorgos Arvanitis | Pierre Lhomme","m_edited_by":"Dagmar Hirtz","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Castle Hill Productions (USA)","m_release_dates":"21 March 1991 (1991-03-21) (Germany) | 31 January 1992 (1992-01-31) (USA) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"117 minutes","m_country":"Germany","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$516,517 (USA) | Voyager (German: Homo Faber) is a 1991 English-language drama film directed by Volker Schlöndorff, and starring Sam Shepard, Julie Delpy, and Barbara Sukowa.
