{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Peter Neal, an American writer of violent horror novels, is in Italy to promote his latest work, Tenebrae. He is accompanied by his literary agent, Bullmer and his assistant, Anne. Neal is unaware that he has also been followed to Rome by his embittered ex-wife, Jane. Just before Neal arrived in Rome, Elsa, a young female shoplifter, was murdered with a razor by an unseen assailant. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal is soon contacted by the police in the form of Detective Giermani and his female partner, Inspector Altieri. | More killings take place. Tilde, a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover Marion. Maria, the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is later hacked to death with a axe after discovering the killer's lair. Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti has an unusually intense interest in his work. That night, Neal and his Italian assistant Gianni watch Berti's house. Gianni approaches the house alone to get a better view and sees an assailant hack Berti to death with an axe. However, Gianni is unable to see the murderer's face. He returns to Neal to find the novelist has been knocked unconscious on the lawn. | Giermani discovers that Berti was obsessed with Neal's novels, and believes the killings will stop now that Berti is dead. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square. Gianni is haunted by the thought that he missed the importance of something he saw at Berti's house. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers that he had heard Berti confessing to his attacker: \"I killed them all, I killed them all!\" Before Gianni can share this detail with anyone, he is strangled to death from the back seat of his car. | Jane sits at her kitchen table with a pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks off one of her arms. The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer continues to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane. | Inspector Altieri arrives at the house and Neal kills her. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards; when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he slits his throat in front of them. Finding the telephone out of order, Giermani and Anne go outside to report the incident from the car radio. Giermani returns to the house and is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"After completing Inferno (1980), the second in his planned Three Mothers trilogy of supernatural horror films, Argento was expected to move straight into production of its concluding chapter. The first in the trilogy, Suspiria (1977), had turned the director into what Alan Jones called \"a horror superstar\", but Inferno had proven a difficult follow-up. Argento had become unwell while writing the film, and his ill health continued into filming. In addition, Argento's relationship with Inferno's co-producer 20th Century Fox had soured the director on \"Hollywood politics\", so when Inferno was not well-received upon release, Argento put the Three Mothers trilogy on hold.[1] Inferno also flopped commercially.[34] According to James Gracey, Argento – under pressure and feeling \"the need to once again defy expectations\" – returned to the giallo genre and began work on Tenebrae.[47] Argento later stated that he wanted to \"put on film a gory roller-coaster ride packed with fast and furious murders\" and that he \"shouldn't resist what [his] hardcore audience wanted\".[1] He added that he had also become irritated that in the years since his last giallo so many other directors had made films derivative of – and inferior to – his own genre-defining works.[22] | Argento said that Tenebrae was influenced by two disturbing incidents he had in 1980.[1] After Suspiria's surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly,[21] to talk about Suspiria's influence on him.[6] According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing.[22] The fan claimed that he wanted \"to harm Argento in a way that reflected how much the director's work had affected him\",[21] and that because the director had \"ruined his life\", he in turn wanted to ruin Argento's.[22] Although no violence came of the threat, Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying,[2] and felt unable to write. At the advice of his producers, Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to resume writing. However, after a few weeks the fan found Argento and resumed his calls, issuing more threats. The director decided to return to Italy.[22] Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan's threats were \"symptomatic of that city of broken dreams\" with its \"celebrity stalkers and senseless crime\". The second incident occurred during Argento's stay at The Beverly Hilton, where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby. Later hearing of a drive-by shooting outside a local cinema, Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings: \"To kill for nothing, that is the true horror of today ... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it's completely repugnant, and that's the sort of atmosphere I wanted to put across in Tenebrae.\"[1] | Argento reportedly offered the lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but it eventually went to Anthony Franciosa.[1] Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as he was capable of bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer.[34] According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one.[1][48] In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a cameo in Tenebrae.[1] According to Nicolodi, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrow (which eventually went to Veronica Lario).[48] Alan Jones says that Nicolodi was cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback.[1] However, Thomas Rostock says that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the woman on the beach.[19] | When the American actress who had been hired to play Anne dropped out just before the start of principal photography, Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role.[19] Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own, and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously, whom she said had much more personality than Anne. She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim.[48] Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written. Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film, and that only the American characters had discernible personalities.[23] Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough, Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright Tennessee Williams and their experience in theatre, leading the director to make sure their shared scenes \"were an ordeal to endure\".[1] The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa, \"leave my woman alone!\"[46] Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly, continuing over the film's end credits.[1] She had been directed to scream only a little, but knowing it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete, Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time, much to Argento's and the crew's surprise.[48] Nicolodi said the scene was her \"cathartic release from the whole nightmare\".[1] | Although Tenebrae was an Italian production, most of the cast spoke their dialogue in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices.[49] However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by David Graham, and most of the female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta.[23] Michele Soavi – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on Tenebrae and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene.[36] Another of Argento's collaborators, Fulvio Mingozzi cameoed as a hotel porter.[6] In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own.[45] In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, Tenebrae.[8] | Filming began on 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks.[1] shot mostly on location in Rome. Kim Newman described the Rome of Tenebrae as unlike the one usually shown on television and in films, with none of the usual historical landmarks. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento, as some of his previous films had utilised so much of recognisable Italy. Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece; Newman said it was Argento's way of saying, \"Rome is a vibrant city. It is modern.\"[34] Most of Tenebrae's location shooting was carried out in Rome's EUR business and residential district.[14] The first flashback scene was filmed at the Capocotta beach, south of the city near Ostia.[9] The shoplifting scene near the beginning of Tenebrae was filmed on location at department store La Rinascente, off Piazza Fiume.[34] Bullmer's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called \"Le Terrazze\" in Rome's Casal Palocco residential neighbourhood.[43] The scene in which Neal's landlord's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti,[18] switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti's house for the confrontation with the killer.[50] The scene at the beginning of the film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.[51] | Giuseppe Bassan – a frequent Argento collaborator – was the film's production designer.[46] The surroundings are given a bleached, \"merciless\" look, made from marble and stone façades, shiny metallic sculptures, with steel, water and glass surfaces. Some of the homes – specifically those of the lesbian couple and he first killer – are \"cold, austere, brutalist\" slabs of granite,[18] and many of the interior shots feature plain white backgrounds, with characters' wearing pale-coloured clothes against them – better, Newman felt, to contrast the blood once the violence started.[34] The studio-set scenes were filmed at Elios Studios in Rome, unlike Argento's previous films in the city, which he had filmed at Incir De Paolis.[52] He could not use Elios because his idol Michelangelo Antonioni was using the studio to film Identification of a Woman (1982) at the time.[43] The design and creation of Tenebrae's special effects was supervised by Giovanni Corridori, who – with his brother Tonino – had a near-monopoly on special effects in the Italian film industry at the time.[36] The scene in which Jane is hacked to death after having her arm cut off was filmed about eight times. Argento was not satisfied with any of the takes he had,[53] which used a type of bicycle pump to spray fake blood from the \"wound\" across the white wall,[48] so the director had Corridori place an explosive squib in the prosthetic arm – a solution which apparently satisfied Argento.[53] | Much of Tenebrae takes place during daytime, or in harshly over-lit interiors. Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings.[54] The lighting and camerawork used in Andrzej Żuławski's Possession (1981) was an influence on the film's look.[55] Although tenebrae/tenebre is a Latin/Italian word meaning \"darkness\" or \"shadows\", Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a \"cold, stark and semi-futuristic look\".[56] Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the \"realistic manner of lighting\" used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting \"a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes ... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring.\"[54] Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city.[22] Tovoli used Kodak 5247 film stock (125 ASA speed rating) for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for images that were \"crystal clear\", and night that was awash with light.[24] | Film scholar Richard Dyer highlights several intelligent devices uses by Argento in the editing of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by \"shots of pills and the sound of running water.\"[57] Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts in the latter part of the film are among cinema's \"most brutal and stylized\", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism.[58] Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of Tenebrae make it as much an example of art cinema as anything else.[4] The initial murders are shot in a \"clipped montage style\",[14] which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene.[59] Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.[7] | \"The crane shot ... should be one of the most memorable moments in cinema ... The shot begins outside the lower apartment window, moves up to the second floor window, up and over the roof of the building, down the other side and to a window on the opposite side of the building. The shot lasts two and a half minutes without a pause, jerk or cut. If I was to be stuck on a desert island, I'd want Tenebrae just so I could watch this single shot .. The shot stands out even more with the fact that the Luma [sic] camera used was new to the industry at the time, and was bulky and not as easy to use as it is now.\" | Gracey refers to the film's cinematography as \"nothing short of astounding\", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's \"passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals\".[56] Influenced by the closing shot of The Passenger (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer,[1] one of Tenebrae's main setpieces is the murder of the lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes-long tracking shot. Owing to its extreme length, the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete.[61] It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more.[59] The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot.[60] It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France.[56] According to Gracey, the camera performs \"aerial gymnastics\", scaling the victims' house in \"one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home\".[56] Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, at the time it was \"truly ground-breaking\" in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint.[38] Patrick McAllister of Scifilm said the sequence should be considered \"one of the most memorable moments in cinema\". According to McAllister, Tenebrae's distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was \"meaningless\".[60] Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it \"meaninglessly brilliant\".[38] | Some European publicity materials for the film, including posters and lobby card sets, advertised the film as Tenebre, and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release uses that same title.[62] However, on the print itself, during the opening credits, the title is clearly Tenebrae. In addition, the title of Neal's latest book in the film is shown in closeup as being Tenebrae. In a lengthy interview with Argento conducted by Martin Coxhead that appeared in two issues of Fangoria in 1983 and 1984, the title was always referred to as \"Tenebrae\".[63][64] Early on in production, the film as referred to as Under the Eyes of the Assassin, which was later used as one of the poster taglines. In Japan, the film was released as Shadows,[35] and in the United States it was released as Unsane in its initial – heavily edited – incarnation.[65]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Dario Argento","m_produced_by":"Claudio Argento Salvatore Argento","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Anthony Franciosa John Saxon Daria Nicolodi","m_music_by":"Claudio Simonetti Fabio Pignatelli Massimo Morante (as Simonetti, Pignatelli & Morante)","m_cinematography":"Luciano Tovoli","m_edited_by":"Franco Fraticelli","m_production_company":"Sigma Cinematografica Roma","m_distributed_by":"Titanus","m_release_dates":"28 October 1982","m_running_time":"110 minutes (original cut) 101 minutes (director's cut) 91 minutes (edited cut)","m_country":"Italy","m_language":"English Italian","m_budget":"Unknown","m_box_office":"Unknown | Tenebrae (also known as Tenebre) is a 1982 Italian giallo film written and directed by Dario Argento. The film stars Anthony Franciosa as American author Peter Neal, who – while in Rome promoting his latest murder-mystery novel – becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by the novel. John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi co-star as Neal's agent and assistant; Giuliano Gemma and Carola Stagnaro appear as detectives investigating the murders. John Steiner, Veronica Lario and Mirella D'Angelo also feature. The film has been described as exploring themes of dualism and sexual aberration, and has strong metafictional elements; some commentators consider Tenebrae to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work, most especially his depictions of murders of beautiful women. | After Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977's Suspiria and 1980's Inferno, Tenebrae represented the filmmaker's return to the giallo horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticise him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of Tenebrae. The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted \"to kill for nothing\".[1] | Shot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios, Tenebrae utilised mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realise his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebrae's music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music. | Tenebrae was a modest success in Italy; it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes. However, in the United Kingdom, it was added to the infamous list of \"video nasties\" and banned from sale until 1999. The film's theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984, when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title Unsane. In its cut form, Tenebrae received a mostly negative critical reception, but the original, fully restored version later became widely available for reappraisal; it is considered by some to be one of Argento's best thrillers. The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh said that it was \"in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made\".[2] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"Footnotes | ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q Jones, Alan (27 June 2011). \"Dario Argento's Tenebrae (DVD booklet)\".
