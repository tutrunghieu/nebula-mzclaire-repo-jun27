Jonathan Chissick, managing director of Hoyts, said \"I thought it was the best script to come out of Australia. So, we failed there somewhere. I don't want to point my finger but there was obviously a failure.\"[5] | The Coolangatta Gold was parodied by the Australian comedy troupe The D-Generation in the 1993 season of The Late Show. The sketch \"The Last Aussie Auteur: A Tribute to Filmmaker Warren Perso\" features excerpts from various (fictional) Australian films, one being a box-office flop titled The Bermagui Bronze.","m_production":"Writer Peter Schreck and director Igor Auzins had worked together successfully on We of the Never Never (1982) and decided to collaborate on another project. They wanted to do a contemporary love story in the sporting genre, and originally thought of doing a $1.5 million film shot in Bondi. However, after a few days it became obvious they wanted to do something more ambitious. Auzins and Schreck formed a company, Angoloro Productions, with John Weiley as a third partner in December 1982. They then approached Hoyts Edgley who agreed to finance within 24 hours.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"developed from an idea by Max Oldfield","m_directed_by":"Igor Auzins","m_produced_by":"John Weiley","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Joss McWilliam Colin Friels Nick Tate Josephine Smulders Robyn Nevin","m_music_by":"Bill Conti","m_cinematography":"Keith Wagstaff","m_edited_by":"Tim Wellburn","m_production_company":"Hoyts Edgley","m_distributed_by":"Hoyts Umbrella Entertainment","m_release_dates":"1984","m_running_time":"112 minutes","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English","m_budget":"A$5.6 million[1]","m_box_office":"A$1,365,000[2] | The Coolangatta Gold is a 1984 Australian film which led to the establishment of the iron man race The Coolangatta Gold.[3] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p357-359 | ^ \"Australian Films at the Australian Box Office\", Film Victoria accessed 24 October 2009 | ^ About the Coolangatta Gold at Surf Life Saving | ^ Jim Schembri, \"Peter Schreck\", Cinema Papers, Feb-March 1985 p35-37, 84-85 | ^ Nick Roddick, \"The budgets, the pictures, the problems...\", Cinema Papers, September 1986 p10 | ^ \"Umbrella Entertainment\".
