Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club called the film \"flawed\" but \"enjoyable\", adding, \"It's pretty much as ridiculous as it sounds, but there's something inherently entertaining about make-up-splattered vampires, distinguished British actors, and martial artists squaring off in periodic eruptions of kung-fu fighting.\"[4] | Phil Chandler of DVD Cult wrote, \"Is it the best Hammer horror film ever made? Hell no. Is it the best Hammer film of the seventies? Hell yeah.\"[3] | Graeme Clark of The Spinning Image said, \"Cushing, in his last Hammer Dracula film, is as commanding as ever, but he and his Western companions are pretty disposable to the plot until the end, where the professor is left alone with the Count, who is hardly needed. Nevertheless, this last Hammer vampire outing has a real energy, in spite of being a mishmash, and is different enough to get by on sheer novelty alone.\"[5] | Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called the raising of the undead army \"one of the most visually spectacular in zombie cinema\".[6] Glenn Kay, who wrote Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide, called the film \"boisterous, action-packed, and very likeable\".[7]","m_production":"Both Roy Ward Baker, a British director who had helmed several previous Hammer films, and Chang Cheh, a veteran Hong Kong action director, worked on the movie, though only Baker is credited. He took over the making of the film after Gordon Hessler left it weeks before. Filming was hard, as both Chinese and British crews had to work together in spite of language and cultural problems. | The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires was a co-production with Hong Kong's Shaw Studio, made in the hope of garnering some of the kung fu movie market share. | The movie was released with various titles in different locations, including The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula and Dracula and the Seven Golden Vampires. During some scenes involving roving gangs of undead, several vampires can be seen hopping up and down, as vampires tend to do in Chinese vampire films. | The North American release version trims twenty minutes of the film's footage and soundtrack and loops several remaining scenes to fill the running time.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Roy Ward Baker | Chang Cheh","m_produced_by":"Don Houghton | Vee King Shaw","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Cushing | John Forbes-Robertson | David Chiang | Robin Stewart | Julie Ege","m_music_by":"James Bernard","m_cinematography":"Roy Ford | John Wilcox","m_edited_by":"Chris Barnes","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

It is the ninth and final film in the Hammer Dracula series. It was released in North America in an edited version as The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula, and alternatively known as The Seven Brothers and Their One Sister Meet Dracula.[1][2] The film is notable for having an actor other than Christopher Lee portray Count Dracula in the Hammer Dracula series; before this film was made, Lee left the role of the Count. The role of Dracula is played by John Forbes-Robertson (though the actor's voice is dubbed by David de Keyser). |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Dracula Goes Martial Arty\".
