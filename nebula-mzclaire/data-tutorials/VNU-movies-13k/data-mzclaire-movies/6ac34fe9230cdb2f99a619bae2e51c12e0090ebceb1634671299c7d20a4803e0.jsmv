{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film follows the adventures of El Superbeasto (Tom Papa), a suave, yet violent exploitation film actor/director and former masked wrestler, and his sultry \"sidekick\" and sister, the super-agent Suzi-X (Sheri Moon Zombie), as they prevent the evil Dr. Satan (Paul Giamatti) from taking over the world by marrying the foul-mouthed stripper Velvet Von Black (Rosario Dawson) with the mark of the devil on her backside. The adventure, set in the mythic world of Monsterland, also features Murray the Robot (Brian Posehn), Suzi-X's sidekick and vehicle, based on the robot featured in the 1939 serial The Phantom Creeps starring Bela Lugosi.[1] | Director Rob Zombie also references several other films. Tom Papa, writer and the voice of the titular character, incorporated his style of humor to his character. Throughout the film, El Superbeasto often makes observations in unusual moments, like Papa does in his stand-ups.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"El Superbeasto received mixed reviews.

He went on to say that, although he was then on tour until February, \"we will finally finish the music on Superbeasto and it'll be done\" afterwards.[4] | Rob Zombie had the following to say in a September 28, 2008 posting on the official El Superbeasto Myspace page: \"We're down to the end! 3 long years in the making and worth every second.

And it's awesome, but I don't have a release date yet. It's like an R-rated adult/monster/sex comedy. There's nothing really like it that I can think of. People always say like Ralph Bakshi's stuff, but...it's [more] like if SpongeBob and Scooby-Doo were filthy.\"[8] The film, running feature length at 75 minutes, was released on DVD on September 22 of that year.[9] A majority of the songs in the film are written and performed by Chris Hardwick and Mike Phirman's comedy duo Hard 'n Phirm.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Haunted World of El Superbeasto  by Rob Zombie","m_directed_by":"Rob Zombie","m_produced_by":"Andy Gould | Tom Klein | Rob Zombie","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tom Papa | Sheri Moon Zombie | Paul Giamatti | Tom Kenny | Rosario Dawson | Brian Posehn","m_music_by":"Tyler Bates | Hard 'n Phirm","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Bret Marnell","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Anchor Bay Films","m_release_dates":"September 22, 2009 (2009-09-22) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"77 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is a 2009 American adult animated exploitation musical comedy horror film directed by Rob Zombie and written by Zombie and Tom Papa based on Zombie's comic book series of the same name. | The film stars Papa, Sheri Moon Zombie, Paul Giamatti, Tom Kenny, Rosario Dawson, and Brian Posehn.
