{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Ultraviolet takes place in 2078, in the years following a global epidemic that causes vampire-like symptoms, including super-human strength and elongated canines. The infected \"hemophages\" die within twelve years after being infected. The \"Archministry\", a militant medical group headed by Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus, has taken control of the government and begun rounding up infected citizens and exterminating them in order to contain the virus. | Having been infected a decade earlier, Violet Song Jat Shariff has become a member of an underground resistance movement fighting to protect the hemophages from the government. Working with the resistance, Violet steals a weapon that was apparently created to exterminate all hemophages, only to discover that it is a young boy named \"Six\". Rather than kill the child, Violet flees with the boy, believing that a cure for the disease can be reverse-engineered from the antigens before he dies from them. | She eventually converses with Daxus, who tells her that the boy is his son, but she does not believe him. Instead she takes him to her friend Garth, who tells her the boy has no antigens and he has no value to anyone. He also tells her that the boy has a tracking device embedded in him (\"so hot he's nearly radioactive\"), that they can track him easily and he has only 8 hours to live. In the meantime, Nerva reveals to Violet that the antigens in Six's blood are actually deadly to humans. Furthermore, Daxus clarifies that the boy is his clone, his previous claim to her being a ruse to earn her sympathy. Since the hemophages are nearly exterminated, the Archministry intends to engineer a new plague to maintain its power. When he refuses to give her the cure, Violet escapes with Six and lets him spend his last moments at a playground. Daxus arrives and takes Six's body for dissection. | Later, however, Violet realizes that Six may not actually be dead. She storms the Archministry and reaches a lab just as Daxus is about to begin the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six may, after all, be instrumental in creating a cure for the hemophages, although it may be too late for Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).","m_cast":"Milla Jovovich as Violet Song Jat Shariff Ida Martin as young Violet | Cameron Bright as Six | Nick Chinlund as Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus Steven Calcote as young Daxus | William Fichtner as Garth | Scott Piper as Garth's assistant | Sebastien Andrieu as Nerva | Christopher Garner as Luthor | Ricardo Mamood-Vega as Song Jat Shariff | Jennifer Caputo as Elizabeth P.

Response to the film was generally negative, with a freshness of only 9% (7 out of 76 critics gave the film a positive review) on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[6] The site's critical consensus states the following: \"An incomprehensible and forgettable sci-fi thriller, Ultraviolet is inept in every regard.\" [7] | Criticism was leveled at Screen Gems, who apparently edited the fight scenes for content and eliminated some of the plotline by cutting more than half an hour from the film (which was retained in the novelization).[citation needed] Comparisons between a rough cut version from the spring of 2005 and the theatrical cut proved there were missing scenes. The original edit was more focused on Violet's desire for a family and suggested that she was swept up in the resistance rather than the cold operative she appears as in the theatrical release, which focused on her imminent death.[8] The unrated DVD restored approximately 6 minutes worth of footage from Wimmer's cut, clocking in at 94 minutes, versus the theatrical release's 88 minutes. | According to Rotten Tomatoes, Jovovich was not pleased with the PG-13 rated release print. She stated that she had been locked out of discussions of the film in the editing stages, and had not been allowed to see her own performance, which she felt might have been improved if she had had some input.[9] | The film grossed $9,064,880 in its opening weekend. Ultraviolet grossed $18,535,812 domestically and $12,534,399 overseas, making for a worldwide gross of $31,070,211. The budget for Ultraviolet was estimated at $30 million.[2]","m_production":"Production began in early February 2004 and was shot in various cities across China, most notably Hong Kong and Shanghai. Production was finished in late June 2004. The film was shot digitally on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900. | In 2005, the film's trailer was leaked on the internet. Director Kurt Wimmer then visited several message boards and demanded all clips be removed in order to keep the film's plot a secret. The online fan community responded well to this, and all the clips were removed from distribution until the theatrical trailer was publicly released in January 2006. It uses \"Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Edition)\" by Rob Dougan as the soundtrack[5] as well as \"24\" by Jem.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Kurt Wimmer","m_produced_by":"John Baldecchi Lucas Foster Tony Mark Pauline Chan","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Milla Jovovich","m_music_by":"Klaus Badelt","m_cinematography":"Arthur Wong","m_edited_by":"William Yeh","m_production_company":"Ultravi Productions","m_distributed_by":"Screen Gems","m_release_dates":"March 3, 2006 (2006-03-03) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes[1] Unrated cut: 94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English Vietnamese","m_budget":"$30 million[2]","m_box_office":"$31 million[2] | Ultraviolet is a 2006 American dystopian science fiction action thriller film written and directed by Kurt Wimmer and produced by Screen Gems. It stars Milla Jovovich as Violet Song, Cameron Bright as Six, and Nick Chinlund as Ferdinand Daxus. It was released in North America on March 3, 2006. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 27, 2006. | The film follows Violet Song Jat Shariff (Jovovich), a woman infected with hemoglophagia, a fictional vampire-like disease, in a future dystopia where anyone infected with the contagious disease is immediately sentenced to death. With her advanced martial arts, a group of rebel hemophages, and a boy named Six (Bright), whose blood may contain a cure for the disease, Violet goes on a mission to overthrow the futuristic government and defeat Ferdinand Daxus (Chinlund). | A novelization of the film was written by Yvonne Navarro, with more back-story and character development. The book differs from the film in a number of ways, including a more ambiguous ending and the removal of some of the more improbable plot twists. An anime series titled Ultraviolet: Code 044 was released by the Japanese anime satellite television network Animax, and created by Madhouse.[3] Because of its many similarities with Equilibrium and because they share the same director, the film is often considered to be Equilibrium's spiritual successor. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"ULTRAVIOLET (15)\".
