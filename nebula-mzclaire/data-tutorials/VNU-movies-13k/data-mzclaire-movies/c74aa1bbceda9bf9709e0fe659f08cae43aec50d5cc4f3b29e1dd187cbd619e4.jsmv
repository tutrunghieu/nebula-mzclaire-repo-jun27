{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"When her father dies, orphan teenager Tamahine (Nancy Kwan) is sent from her South Pacific island home to live with Charles Poole (Dennis Price), her father's cousin and the headmaster of Hallow, a prestigious all-male English school. Richard (John Fraser), Charles' son and school student, falls in love with her, but she considers him tabu because of the closeness of their family relationship. Another suitor is the art master, Clove (Derek Nimmo), after he breaks up with Charles' daughter Diana (Justine Lord). | Meanwhile, Tamahine has trouble adjusting to the puzzling social mores of her new home, exasperating Charles, but also making him start to question his own joyless existence. In the end, Richard convinces Tamahine that marrying him does not violate English tabus, while Clove resigns to go paint in a foreign land, accompanied by Diana. The film leaps ahead several years, showing a scruffily bearded Charles enjoying life on Tamahine's island, while Richard takes his place as headmaster, watched by Tamahine and their children.","m_cast":"Nancy Kwan as Tamahine | John Fraser as Richard Poole | Dennis Price as Charles Poole | Coral Browne as Mme.
