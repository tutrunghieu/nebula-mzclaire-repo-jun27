{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba. | The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands. | After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and advisor, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is \"alive\" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight. | At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his \"part\" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba no longer believes Scar, but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands. Scar appears to comply, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. | With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the Circle of Life continues.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Lion King earned $422,783,777 in North America and an $545,700,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $968,483,777.[2] It is currently the 29th highest-grossing film,[50] the sixth highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide and the third highest-grossing film of Walt Disney Animation Studios (behind Frozen and Zootopia).[51] The film was also the highest-grossing motion picture of 1994 worldwide.[52] After its initial run, having earned $763.4 million,[53] it ranked as the second-highest grossing film of all time worldwide, behind Jurassic Park .[54] It held the record for the highest-grossing animated feature film (in North America, outside North America, and worldwide) until it was surpassed by the computer animated Finding Nemo (2003), Shrek 2 (2004), Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010) prior to the 2011 re-release. With the earnings of the 3D run, The Lion King surpassed all the aforementioned films but Toy Story 3 to rank as the second-highest-grossing animated film worldwide—later downgraded to sixth after Frozen (2013), Minions (2015), and Zootopia (2016)—and it remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film.[55] It is also the biggest animated movie of the last 50 years in terms of estimated attendance.[56] | The Lion King had a limited release in North America on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters, El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City.[57] It still earned $1,586,753 across the weekend of June 17–19, standing at the tenth place of the box office ranking.[58] The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend.[59] The wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories' newest sound systems.[60] The Lion King grossed $40.9 million – which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend earning ever and the highest sum for a Disney film  – to top the weekend box office.[11] It also earned a rare \"A+\" rating from CinemaScore.[61] By the end of its theatrical run, in spring 1995, it had earned $312,855,561,[2] being the second-highest-grossing 1994 film in North America behind Forrest Gump.[62] Outside North America, it earned $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $768.6 million.[53] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 74 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[63] | The film was re-issued on December 25, 2002 for IMAX and large-format theaters. Don Hahn explained that eight years after The Lion King got its original release, \"there was a whole new generation of kids who haven't really seen it, particularly on the big screen.\" Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies.[34][64] An enhanced sound mix was also provided, to as Hahn explained, \"make the audience feel like they're in the middle of the movie.\"[34] On its first weekend, The Lion King made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15,686,215 on May 30, 2003.[65] | In 2011, The Lion King was converted to 3D for a two-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3D Blu-ray release.[46][66] The film opened at the number one spot on Friday, September 16, 2011 with $8.9 million[67] and finished the weekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This made The Lion King the first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the American weekend box office since the re-issue of Return of the Jedi in March 1997.[55] The film also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all time.[68] It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first place at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million.[69] Most box-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its second weekend and were also expecting Moneyball to be at first place.[70] | After its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release.[69] In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with a gross $94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned $83,400,000.[71] The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and The Little Mermaid during 2012 and 2013.[72] However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and theatrical re-release of the The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled.[73] In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, \"the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off.\"[74] | The Lion King was released to critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 91%, based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3 out of 10. It also ranked 56th on their \"Top 100 Animation Movies\".[75] The site's critical consensus reads, \"Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, The Lion King stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films.\"[76] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[77] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade. | Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars and called the film \"a superbly drawn animated feature\" and, in his print review wrote, \"The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet, is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.\"[78] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a \"Thumbs Up\" but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was \"a good film, not a great one\".[79] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it \"an impressive, almost daunting achievement\" and felt that the film was \"spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations\", but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, \"Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.\"[80] | Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, writing that it \"has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie\".[81] Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was \"a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart\".[82] James Berardinelli from ReelViews praised the film saying, \"With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. The Lion King is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded.\"[83] | Some reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative. The staff of TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining, it \"offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.\"[84] The New Yorker's Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like \"manipulat[ing] our responses at will\", as \"Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy\".[85] | The Lion King received four Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. The film would go on to win two Golden Globes; for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score,[86] as well as two Academy Awards, for Best Original Score (Hans Zimmer) and Best Original Song with \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" by Elton John and Tim Rice.[87] The songs \"Circle of Life\" and \"Hakuna Matata\" were also nominated.[87] \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" also won the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance.[88] The Lion King also won Annie Awards for Best Animated Feature, Best Achievement in Voice Acting (for Jeremy Irons) and Best Individual Achievement for Story Contribution in the Field of Animation.[89] | At the Saturn Awards, the film was nominated in two categories, Best Fantasy Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor although it did not win in either category.[90] The film also received two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards, for Best Sound as well as the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music although it lost in both categories to Speed and Backbeat respectively.[91] The film received two BMI Film & TV Awards for Film Music and Most Performed Song with \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\"[92] At the 1995 MTV Movie Awards the film received nominations for Best Villain and Best Song, though it lost in both categories.[93] The Lion King won the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie at the 1995 Kids' Choice Awards.[94] | In 2008, The Lion King was ranked as the 319th greatest film ever made by Empire magazine,[95] and in June 2011, TIME named it one of \"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\".[96] In June 2008, the American Film Institute listed The Lion King as the fourth best film in the animation genre in its AFI's 10 Top 10 list,[97] having previously put \"Hakuna Matata\" as 99th on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs ranking.[98] | Certain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television show, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was in fact working on an American version of Kimba, since he was familiar with the Japanese original.[99] However The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: | The whole time I worked on The Lion King the name of that show never came up. At least I never heard it. I had never seen the show and really only became aware of it as Lion King was being completed, and someone showed me images of it. I worked with George Scribner and Linda Woolverton to develop the story in the early days but then left to help out on Aladdin. If one of them were familiar with Kimba they didn’t say. Of course, it’s possible... Many story ideas developed and changed along the way, always just to make our story stronger. I could certainly understand Kimba’s creators feeling angry if they felt we had stolen ideas from them. If I had been inspired by Kimba I would certainly acknowledge my inspiration. All I can offer is my respect to those artists and say that their creation has its loyal admirers and its assured place in animation history.[100] | Co-director Rob Minkoff also claimed he was unfamiliar with it \"I know for a fact that [\"Kimba\"] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time.\" He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is \"not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas.\"[101] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumours that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, \"we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway ... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!\"[102] | Protests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word \"SEX\" might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down,[103] which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity. One of the animators, Tom Sito, has stated that the letters spell \"SFX\" (a common abbreviation for \"special effects\"), not with an \"E\" instead of the \"F\", and were intended as an innocent \"signature\" created by the effects animation team.[104] | Hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character,[105] and another—who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas—[106] included boycotting The Lion King among the ways it would help preserve hyenas in the wild.[107] The hyenas have also been interpreted to represent an anti-immigrant allegory, where the hyenas would be black and Latino ethnic communities.[108][109][110][111] The film has also been criticised for advancing a fascist narrative in its portrayal of the lion kingdom and the circle of life where \"only the strong and the beautiful triumph, and the powerless survive only by serving the strong.\"[112]","m_production":"The idea for The Lion King was conceived in late 1988 during a conversation between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider on a plane to Europe to promote Oliver & Company. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.[5] The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink.[6] Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, \"It is a little bit about myself.\"[7] In November of that year Thomas Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari,[8] and afterwards Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle.[6] The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,[7] and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.[9] Simba would also not leave the kingdom, but become a \"lazy, slovenly, horrible character\" due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under, decided to attach himself to the project \"because lions are cool\".[6] Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to \"an animated National Geographic special\".[10] | Oliver & Company director George Scribner was the initial director of the film,[11] being later joined by Roger Allers, who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast in October 1991.[5] Allers brought with him Brenda Chapman, who would become the head of story.[6] Afterwards, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Hahn, Chapman, and production designer Chris Sanders, took a trip to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.[12] After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project, as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical, as Scribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.[5][13] Rob Minkoff replaced Scribner,[12] and producer Don Hahn joined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to Disney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature Animation.[10] Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as \"leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world\", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, who had just finished Beauty and the Beast.[12] The script also had its title changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King, as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.[5] | The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than being based on an already-existing work. The filmmakers have said that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses from the Bible and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.[14] During the summer of 1992, the team was joined by screenwriter Irene Mecchi, with a second screenwriter, Jonathan Roberts, joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon and the hyenas.[3] Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the writing team, flying to California at least once a month, as his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyrics – which were reworked up to the production's end – were even pinned to the storyboards during development.[12] Rewrites were frequent, with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated due to dialog changes.[6] | The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters – for instance, James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice \"powerful\" and similar to a lion's roar.[15] Jones commented that during the years of production, Mufasa \"became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king\".[16] | Nathan Lane originally auditioned for Zazu, and Ernie Sabella, for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in Guys and Dolls, were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.[15][17] For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.[9] | Matthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production, and during the three years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once, and only discovered Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the premiere.[18] Jeremy Irons had at first refused the role due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune to a comedic role. But once he came in, Irons' performance even inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Bülow — even adding one of that character's lines, \"You have no idea\" - and animator Andreas Deja to watch both Reversal of Fortune and Damage to pick up Irons' facial traits and tics.[16][19] | \"The Lion King was considered a little movie because we were going to take some risks. The pitch for the story was a lion cub gets framed for murder by his uncle set to the music of Elton John. People said, 'What? Good luck with that.' But for some reason, the people who ended up on the movie were highly passionate about it and motivated.\" | The development of The Lion King started concurrently with Pocahontas, which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.[14] The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job \"because the story wasn't very good\",[6] and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft about the film that \"I don't know who is going to want to watch that one.\"[13] Most of the leading animators were either doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal.[7] Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.[3] Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" sequence,[9] were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King over the course of its production.[11] Weeks before the film was to be released, production was affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which shut off the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.[20] | The character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel.[12] The animators also studied various animal movements in natural settings at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill.[21] The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries – which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher – which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare – and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish.[12][22] Since the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through usage of longer shots following the characters.[9] | The use of computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the \"wildebeest stampede\" sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, cel shaded to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd.[23] Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half minute stampede sequence.[3] Other usages of computer animation were done through CAPS, which helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots, and was employed on the coloring, lighting and particle effects.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Roger Allers | Rob Minkoff","m_produced_by":"Don Hahn","m_screenplay_by":"Irene Mecchi | Jonathan Roberts | Linda Woolverton","m_story_by":"Jim Capobianco | Lorna Cook | Thom Enriquez | Andy Gaskill | Francis Glebas | Ed Gombert | Kevin Harkey | Barry Johnson | Mark Kausler | Jorgen Klubien | Larry Leker | Rick Maki | Burny Mattinson | Joe Ranft | Chris Sanders | Tom Sito | Gary Trousdale","m_starring":"Matthew Broderick | James Earl Jones | Jeremy Irons | Jonathan Taylor Thomas | Moira Kelly | Nathan Lane | Ernie Sabella | Rowan Atkinson | Robert Guillaume | Madge Sinclair | Whoopi Goldberg | Cheech Marin | Jim Cummings","m_music_by":"Hans Zimmer","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Ivan Bilancio","m_production_company":"Walt Disney Pictures Walt Disney Feature Animation","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"June 15, 1994 (1994-06-15) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"88 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$45 million[2]","m_box_office":"$968.5 million[2] | The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings. | The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny. | Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence. | The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story and animation; it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing release of 1994 and the second highest-grossing film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation; two direct-to-video follow-ups—the sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and the prequel/parallel The Lion King 1½ (2004)—two television series, Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard, and a 3D re-release in 2011. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Lion King (U)\".
