{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Spanky is the president of the \"He-Man Womun Haters Club\" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa, Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning undefeated go-kart, \"The Blur\", in the upcoming Soap Box Derby go-kart race. Unfortunately, when the announcement is made at the club meeting that Alfalfa is to be the driver, it is discovered that Alfalfa is nowhere to be found. | The boys go to find Alfalfa and they discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla, whom he is forbidden to be in love with because she is a girl and that is against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the Clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans. | At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks from behind the scenes to sabotage their romantic date. When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which causes her to be offended, thinking that he is ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down. | Darla, having been mistakenly led to believe Alfalfa feels ashamed of her, dumps him and turns her attentions toward Waldo (played by Blake McIver Ewing), the new kid in town whose father (played by Donald Trump) is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, Spanky, Stymie, and friends assign him to guard the club's prized go-kart until the day of the race. | In the meantime, Alfalfa makes several attempts to woo back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that attempt fails, Alfalfa decides to pay her a visit in person at her ballet recital. Spanky accompanies him, but only to try to convince him to permanently break it off with her. While trying to find Darla so they can speak with her, they are pursued by the neighborhood bullies, Butch and Woim. The only way they can hide from them is by dressing up in costumes and pretending to be girls in the ballet recital, which causes them to turn the performance into a complete disaster and be laughed off the stage. Butch and Woim end up chasing Alfalfa all over town in his underwear. Darla and Waldo witness Alfalfa in is underwear, when they are on a pool date. | At the carnival talent show the day before the race, Alfalfa once again tries to win Darla back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his voice. Waldo and Darla also entered the show in a duet. He talks to Alfalfa backstage saying he was amazing and Darla did okay. This angers Alfalfa who believes Waldo does not appreciate Darla. He then requests the chance to perform for her and win her back. But Waldo spoils Alfalfa's attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him the embarrassment of burping out bubbles all throughout his song. | The boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Porky and Buckwheat, have unwittingly come up with $500, not realizing that their method for earning the money was not exactly honest. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree, finds out about the scheme and confronts them, but Spanky convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby. | Due to Alfalfa's carelessness, \"The Blur\" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim, so that now, in addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys now need a new set of wheels. They band together to build \"Blur 2: The Sequel,\" and prior to race day, Spanky and Alfalfa reconcile their friendship and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, which is to be presented to the winners by the greatest racer of all, \"A.J. Ferguson.\" | Butch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla have also entered the go-kart race, but they eventually become annoyed with each other, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car midway through the race. In a wild dash to the finish, and despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, \"The Blur 2\" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo-finish between \"The Blur\" and \"The Blur 2\" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim are angry towards Alfalfa because he won the trophy and the prize money. They attempt to beat him up, but Alfalfa finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a giant pool of pig slop. Woim then gets scared and jumps into the pig slop willingly. | Along with first prize. Spanky, meanwhile, is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be \"a girl!\" (Reba McEntire). Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys pulled the pranks on her at their picnic lunch, not Alfalfa. After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla and friends as well as other girls into the club, adding a \"Women Welcome\" sign onto the front door.","m_cast":"Travis Tedford as Spanky, the president of \"He-Man Women Hater's Club\" and Alfalfa's best friend | Bug Hall as Alfalfa, Spanky's best friend and Darla's boyfriend | Brittany Ashton Holmes as Darla, Alfalfa's girlfriend | Kevin Jamal Woods as Stymie, the club's vice-president | Jordan Warkol (voice dubbed by E.G.
