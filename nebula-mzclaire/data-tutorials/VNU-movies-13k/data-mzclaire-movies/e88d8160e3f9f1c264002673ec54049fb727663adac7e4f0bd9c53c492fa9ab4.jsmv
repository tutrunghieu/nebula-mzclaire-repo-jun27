{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane), who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker—called N.C. (Charlie Rowe)--comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey.[3] They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King (John Turturro) has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. | In the climax of the film, the Nutcracker appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transforms him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she's fully awake, N.C. promises that they'll meet again. After she does so, she goes to Uncle Albert's workshop, where she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and who asks to be called N.C. The two become close friends, and the last shot of the film shows them ice skating together.","m_cast":"Elle Fanning as Mary | Nathan Lane as Uncle Albert | John Turturro as Rat King | Charlie Rowe as N.C. | Frances de la Tour as Frau Eva / Rat Queen | Aaron Michael Drozin as Max | Richard E.

Hoffmann story, and lyricist Tim Rice wrote lyrics for it. Many of the songs are based on the ballet's dances. Other songs are based on Tchaikovsky's other compositions, such as his Symphony No. 5.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Nutcracker  by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Nutcracker and the Mouse King  by E.T.A.
