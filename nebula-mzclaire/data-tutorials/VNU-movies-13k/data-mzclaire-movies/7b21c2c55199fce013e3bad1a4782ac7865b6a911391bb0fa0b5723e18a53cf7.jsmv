{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) is a lonely housewife, living in 1998 in New York City. She is neglected by her doctor husband, William Winthrop (Richard Coyle) and finds solace in the love story of King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and his lover, Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough). Wally travels to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, showcasing items used by Wallis and Edward in their lifetime, and reminisces about their relationship. | In 1930, Edward throws a party at his new home in Fort Belvedere, in Windsor Great Park where he meets Wallis through his mistress, Lady Furness (Katie McGrath). The two develop a mutual attraction for each other, in spite of Wallis being married to Ernest Simpson, and become lovers while Lady Furness is abroad. Wally's reminiscences are interrupted by Sotheby's guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), who takes a liking to her. | Edward and Wallis continue their love affair while touring throughout Europe, where he gives her a number of jewels and assumes the initials W.E. By the end of 1934, Edward is irretrievably besotted with Wallis. He decides to introduce Wallis to his parents, King George V (James Fox) and Queen Mary (Judy Parfitt), but Wallis is portrayed in a bad light by Edward's sister-in-law Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer). A distraught Wallis wants to end the relationship but Edward pacifies her. | Wally urges her husband to have a child together but he doesn't want to and Wally suspects him of having an affair. When she accuses him, William hits her. Wally tries In vitro fertilisation in order to become pregnant. She gradually becomes attracted to Evgeni and eventually goes out on a date with him. She asks Evgeni more about Edward and Wallis, while pondering on her relationship with William. After she returns home, a suspecting William beats Wally and leaves her dying on the floor. | The government of Great Britain and the Dominions refuse to recognize the relationship of Edward and Wallis, since she is a divorcee and so on the night of December 11, 1936, Edward makes a broadcast to the nation and the Empire, explaining his decision to abdicate the throne to his brother Bertie (Laurence Fox). He says, \"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.\" Wallis, who has fled to Villa Lou Viei, near Cannes, hears of this and has no choice other than to join Edward. | Evgeni, who has been calling Wally after their date, runs to her apartment to check on her and finds her on the floor. He takes her to his home in Brooklyn and nurses her back to health. Wally finds a new hope and new direction in life. She falls in love with Evgeni, divorces William and moves on with her life. An imaginary monologue with Wallis shows the two women talking about their lives, how they thought that they were similar, but in the end only Wally found happiness. Through a series of letters from Wallis kept in millionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed's collection, Wally comes to realize that the Duchess was stuck in a relationship with Edward for the rest of her life. Wally leaves behind her fascination with Wallis and Edward's relationship, and learns from her doctor that she is pregnant with Evgeni's baby.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Madonna had written the script for W.E. with director Alek Keshishian. Her then husband Guy Ritchie helped Madonna with the script and the screenplay, advising her to seek meetings with several actors such as Mark Strong and Toby Kebbell, who both had major roles in Ritchie's last film, RocknRolla.[3] Madonna started writing W.E after she had finished filming her directorial venture, Filth and Wisdom (2008). W.E was actually an idea she had before Filth and Wisdom, but instead she filmed the latter, as she felt that she did not have enough experience to shoot a big-budgeted film like W.E.[4] She described the whole film as a much bigger story: | There are more characters, and three of them basically changed the course of British history. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. So I have an enormous responsibility to that, and then I have a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession and is going to the auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.[4] | \"People have accused Wallis of all kinds of things. They've said that she put a spell on Edward. They've said that she was a hermaphrodite and that he was gay. They've said they were Nazi sympathisers. It's just the usual lynch-mob mentality that descends upon somebody who has something that lots of other people don't have.\" | After the writing began, Madonna realized that she needed help as the subject was vast.[4] She enlisted the help of Keshishian, who was well acquainted with Madonna after directing her 1991 documentary Truth or Dare (aka In Bed with Madonna) and two of her music video clips. The writing process was dynamic, with Madonna and Keshishian e-mailing their developed scripts to each other, or through telephone conversations and also by writing on each other's laptop.[4] W.E. was initially reported to be a musical about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Edward and Simpson. However, Madonna confirmed that although they are in the film, the main story was not about them. It was about a woman called Wally Winthrop, a young married New Yorker in 1998 who is obsessed with what she perceived as the ultimate romantic love story—Edward's abdication of the royal throne for his love of Simpson.[6] The character of Simpson acted as a spiritual guide for Winthrop, in the film. The timeline presented in the film ranges from pre-World War II England (1936–37) to New York in 1998, and the storyline swaps between these two eras. Madonna decided to use the Sotheby's auction of Edward and Simpson's estate in 1998, to flash backward from.[4] | Madonna's inspiration to direct the film came from the controversial lives of Edward and Simpson.[4] She recalled from her experience that if she brought up King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson at a dinner party or a social gathering, \"it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail into the room. Everyone erupts into an argument about who they were. I mean, they were very controversial – and continue to be. So, of course, I'm very attracted to that.\"[7] She investigated the history behind the abdication and tried to understand what led Edward to leave his royal throne.[8] The singer spent two years researching the life of Simpson and writing the script. She wallpapered an empty room in her house with pictures from auction catalogues and photographs of the Duke and Duchess throughout their lives.[9] \"I was sitting in a room that was completely and utterly inundated with their images so I could soak up their energy. I was trying to understand the nature of their love story and trying to figure out for myself if there is such a thing as perfect love,\" she said.[9] However, not interested in making a biopic about Simpson, Madonna created the modern-day story about the character Wally Winthrop, so that she could have a point of view in which to tell the narrative. She explained later: \"We can all read the same history book and have a different point of view. So it was important for me to not present the story and say, 'This is the one and only story,' but to say, 'This story moved me and inspired me.' That's how the two love stories were created.\"[8] One of the first characters that Madonna developed for the film was a Russian immigrant living in Brooklyn and working in Manhattan, called Evgeni. The character was inspired by Eugene Hütz, who played the lead role in Filth and Wisdom.[4] Another motivation behind the project was the celebrity aspect of Edward and Simpson, who became the subject of intense media scrutiny and public vilification and were ostracized by the Royal Family.[8] Madonna, being interested in the cult of celebrity, found that many of the rumors surrounding Simpson's life are untrue and she could not find any empirical evidence supporting them.[8] Hence she wanted to portray Simpson as a human being with flaws, imperfections and a vulnerable side. \"The message of the film is to realize that in the end happiness lies in your own head and that we are in fact in charge of our destiny,\" she said.[8] | After finishing the script and starting work on casting and production, Madonna realised that the budget of film was going to be high. Simpson's character had around 80 costume changes with dresses by designers like Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Madeleine Vionnet and Elsa Schiaparelli. Most of the actual dresses were kept in museum archives, hence unobtainable to Madonna. Instead, many of the couture houses offered to create the dresses for her.[4] While casting for the film, she asked for a Michael O'Connor wedding dress, in display at the National Museum of Costume in Scotland, for a scene where Riseborough would wear it.[10] National Museum of Costume general manager Margaret Roberts said they were happy to send the dress to Madonna. \"Our Marriage in the Movies exhibition is packed with fabulous gowns that tell a story not only about the history of the period they represent, but also of Hollywood glamour and style,\" she said. [...] This is a dress that was made for the movies, so when we received the request from Madonna's production company, we were only too happy to oblige.\"[10] Other fashion designers working for the film included John Galliano and Issa, who provided clothes, Pierre Cartier the jewels, and Stephen Jones the hats.[7] | She also enlisted costume designer Arianne Phillips to create the dresses for the film. The costumes designed were a combination of real vintage pieces, others were remade based on patterns that were obtained out of the museum archives, and the rest had to be freshly made.[4] In an interview with W magazine in November 2011, Philips explained that she \"started doing research in 2009, a year before [W.E.] began filming... To me, Wallis Simpson was a style icon, but I didn’t know she was a couture client well before she met Edward. She was also a hungry whore for jewelry. Edward gave Wallis jewelry to make her feel royal. My first task was figuring out how to re-create those famous gifts.\"[11] Madonna had sent a box of her research to Phillips, so that the designer could get a head start for the project.[12] The singer understood the kind of attention to detail needed to create the costumes, drawing from her own garments which included couture. Phillips then researched the clothes on display at fashion departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.[12] She then went to Los Angeles, where retailer Doris Raymond, from The Way We Wore had opened up her personal library of 1930s couture. There Phillips watched old newsreels from the University of California archives.[12] Once filming started, the designer moved in Madonna's guesthouse in London, where they would watch the shot reels together and scrutinize the dresses.[12] Phillips established contacts with designer labels like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels to replicate a cross bracelet and ten other pieces.[11] For the gowns, undergarments, and dresses needed for the 60 costume changes in the film, Phillips scoured the archives of Vionnet and Schiaparelli; then with the cooperation of both houses she redesigned Simpson's clothing. The first dress in which Riseborough appeared as Simpson in the film was a re-creation of the dress owned by Simpson herself. Phillips decked the dresses with diamond bow brooch at the neck and paired with organza skirts, and was able to obtain duplicates for some of them from Cos Prop, a costume shop in London.[12] | Some of the pieces that the duchess actually ordered I thought were hideous. Those wouldn’t work for the movie, so we modified and invented. Wallis wasn’t pretty; she was handsome, at best. In England, it was noted over and over how unattractive she was. But Wallis was a lot of fun—very entertaining. She had a freedom to her that was definitely reflected in her clothes; the duchess was all about presentation. And that became her refuge, and her prison.[11] | According to Phillips, Edward's choice of clothes were specific and he rebelled against what his father dictated as the protocol for dresses. He used to wear navy blue tails, rather than black ones, as formalwear.[12] The designer was able to see the original ones he owned at the National Museum of Costume. To re-create the look, Phillips contacted luxury goods company Alfred Dunhill who had an understanding of bespoke tailoring available in London's Savile Row.[12] They provided Phillips with tailor, wools and fabrics from the mills that had created the original fabrics for Edward himself. Phillips tailored the baggy looks of the 1930s suits, to make them appealing for the contemporary audience. In the end, all the costumes were hand-made, with a total of 60 costumes being created for Simpson and 30 for Edward.[12] | Madonna started work on the casting of W.E after coming back from Africa, where she had worked on her Raising Malawi initiative.[4] She recalled how she found the task of casting actors for different parts as difficult, since many of them would refuse to sign for a particular role. Madonna contrasted the process of film casting with her task of making a new album, where she can easily choose the people she wants to work with.[4] Abbie Cornish was signed to play the part of Wally Winthrop, while King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson were played by James D'Arcy and Andrea Riseborough, respectively. Winthrop's Russian love interest Evgeni was played by Oscar Isaac and her husband William was played by Richard Coyle.[6] Actress Vera Farmiga was initially asked for the role of Simpson. Farmiga commented: | Madonna approached me. We sat for a cup of tea and again for a cup of tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.[17] | Farmiga later withdrew from the project as she had become pregnant with her second child, and Riseborough replaced her.[18] After Farmiga had declined the project, Madonna looked into many actresses, before zeroing on Riseborough, whom she had seen as a young Margaret Thatcher in the BBC film The Long Walk to Finchley. Madonna explained her choice: \"I was looking for a certain quality: something fragile, androgynous and yet feminine in a really old-fashioned way. When I saw Andrea, I knew immediately she was the one.\"[9] Cornish commented on her role as Winthrop, \"Madonna is a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to define her – and that's admirable. She's studied every aspect of what happened with Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII. [...] It's a fascinating insight into class and romance. Madonna's created a contemporary woman—who I will play—called Wally, who is fascinated by what happened to Mrs. Simpson.\"[13][17] Madonna's daughter Lourdes was offered a part, but Madonna decided against the idea.[19] However, she later allowed Lourdes to appear for a minor role in the film.[20] The part she played was later confirmed by Cornish in an interview in March 2011 as the younger self of her character Wally Winthrop.[21] | Ewan McGregor was offered the part of King Edward VIII,[22] but was later replaced by James D'Arcy.[14][23] Additionally, producer David Parfitt and casting director Nina Gold also quit W.E., with sources claiming that the duo had \"creative differences\" with Madonna and found that she struggled to \"collaborate and delegate\".[24] Actress Margo Stilley was to play the role of Lady Thelma Furness, but left the project, citing \"artistic differences\" with Madonna. Stilley said: \"I had the role, but we had artistic differences. She (Madonna) is really something. I wish the cast luck because they are all really talented.\"[25] In her place, Katie McGrath joined the cast.[16] Judy Parfitt was signed to portray Queen Mary and Geoffrey Palmer as Stanley Baldwin.[14] Real-life father and son James and Laurence Fox were signed to the parts of King George V and his son, Bertie—Edward's younger brother.[15] BBC reported that members of the London Welsh Center expressed interest in appearing for a scene in the film, which involves Edward being shocked at the living conditions in Welsh mining villages. A spokesperson for the centre, which was contacted by the film's casting agency, said: \"I've had about 15 phone calls this morning, and yesterday was bedlam because everybody wants to be in a film with Madonna.\" The centre said Welsh-speakers were needed as extras to create scenes based on Edward's visits to the south Wales valleys in the 1930s.[26] Actress Natalie Dormer was cast to play the part of a young Queen Elizabeth (Queen Mother). Dormer reflected on the role, saying: \"This country tends to remember the Queen Mother as a rather wrinkly 97 year-old, but I am playing her when she was quite an enchanting, engaging twenty and thirty-something. [...] She was quite a savage and savvy game player.\"[5] Dormer's assertion of the role was confirmed by royal historian Hugo Vickers, who was sought by Madonna to advise her on the characteristics of the different members of the royal family. He confirmed that Madonna was portraying the Queen Mother as an unfavorable influence on the relationship between Edward VIII and Simpson.[27] | \"I directed Filth & Wisdom to teach myself about filmmaking... And now, with this self-punishing process of being a producer and a writer and a director, I'm taking the next step.\" | Madonna wanted to shoot the film in certain locations where the British Royal family reside. A representative from her commented: \"Madonna is keen to make the film as authentic as possible and would be very grateful if we are allowed to film at certain locations, She loves the UK and holds the Queen in the highest regard.\"[29][30] Madonna decided to move back to the United Kingdom as the film would take six months to shoot.[31] The budget of the film is £18 million ($36 million).[1] Shooting began on July 5, 2010, and locations included London and Home Counties, with forays in New York and France.[18] The Daily Mail reported that Madonna chose a pub in Kensington in west London, on July 21, 2010, to shoot some scenes for the film. She chose the top two floors of The Abingdon Pub, and worked for almost five hours there.[20] This was followed by shooting scenes in the Club Quarters of Trafalgar Square on July 26, 2010.[32] Other places where filming took place include the Stoke Park Country Club, Spa and Hotel in Buckinghamshire.[33] | Then filming moved to France, where on July 29, 2010, Madonna shot scenes with D'Arcy and Riseborough in Palm Beach in Marseille, south of France and on the port of Villefranche-sur-Mer on July 30, 2010.[34] Scenes were also shot at the Hotel Le Meurice, with Cornish in a new look consisting of dyed black hair, pale skin and a fitted black dress.[35] She shot footage of a ten-second bath scene for the film.[36] While shooting with Riseborough, Madonna and her team approached jewellery company Cartier to create copies of Simpson's extensive gem collection, which Riseborough had to wear during filming. However, one of the bracelets slipped off from Riseborough's arm while shooting, and was lost in the Mediterranean Sea. Madonna had to immediately order for replicating the jewellrey.[37] Designer Arianne Phillips described the filming which involved the original jewelry of Simpson: | We were able to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a revolving door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There were a couple of times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.[12] | In September, Madonna shot some scenes involving Lourdes. Shooting took place around Mayfair, outside the hotel Claridge's, as well as in a set of Downing Street, created in Aldwych. Lourdes' scenes required her to be dressed as a schoolgirl.[38] The same month, filming moved to New York, where Madonna shot scenes in Brooklyn.[1] A dance sequence was shot where D'Arcy had to do a ballet, but he did not know how to do it and was requested by Madonna to learn the steps. D'Arcy described the sequence as \"this extraordinary beautiful dance with lifts and twirls and I can't do that, but you do because she [Madonna] somehow makes the impossible possible and it gives you amazing self esteem when you do these things.\" Although the dance scene did not make the final cut of the film, Madonna also asked D'Arcy to learn to play bagpipes in six weeks and to ride horses.[39] | Initial reports claimed that Madonna had composed the score of the film with producer William Orbit, and Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski assisting them. However the latter was credited as the sole music composer for the film.[40][41] Madonna had heard Korzeniowski's work on the soundtrack for the 2009 drama film, A Single Man. The singer recalled that she was \"struck by the score's 'bittersweet' qualities, this melancholic, romantic, sweeping emotional kind of heartbreaking beauty.\"[42] She asked the film's director, fashion designer Tom Ford, about Korzeniowski and after she received positive feedback about him, she decided to sign Korzeniowski for composing W.E.'s score.[42] Previously, Madonna had included parts of the score from A Single Man into the rough cut for W.E., as well as in some of the screenplay.[42] The score predominantly features usage of strings, accompanied by electric guitar, harp, viola and piano. The combination of traditional and modern instrumentation was used to bridge the two different time-periods portrayed in the film.[42] | Korzeniowski and conductor Terry Davies recorded a 60-piece orchestra at London's Abbey Road Studios in April 2011, concentrating on purely the emotional states of the characters, and did not concern himself too much with differentiating the periods of the film.[42][43] In an interview with Variety, the composer said that for the scenes featuring Simpson, he tried to make the score be more modern than the scenes featuring Winthrop.[42] Madonna wanted Korzeniowski to keep the score simple and direct. She felt that Korzeniowski being a classically trained musician, he would be cerebral in his approach to music and would over complicate the score.[42] \"It is not the type of score where you go through crazy harmonic changes and modulations,\" said the composer. \"This was one of the very precise notes I got from Madonna, that I was not supposed to over-think this music.\"[42] The main inspiration behind the score was the irrational love as portrayed in the film, which Korzeniowski said could be \"just an illusion\". He wanted the music to reflect those powerful and conflicting emotions through the melodies, repeating between despair and sorrow, and hope and joy.[43] | Madonna contributed a new song titled \"Masterpiece\" for the soundtrack, composed by herself, Julie Frost and Jimmy Harry, while produced by Orbit.[44] In the song, she sings about the pain of being in love with someone who is a great work of art, with the lyrics going like \"If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move.\"[45] A writer from Billboard described \"Masterpiece\" as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as \"simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s\". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus going on like: \"And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece.\"[46] The song plays over the end credits of W.E. and would be included in Madonna's upcoming album, MDNA.[45] The soundtrack was released digitally through Interscope Records, on January 31, 2012.[43][47] | All music composed by Abel Korzeniowski except \"Masterpiece\". | Production credits as per W.E. press release from the official film website, Madonna.com and The Weinstein Company.[6][41][92]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Madonna","m_produced_by":"Madonna Kris Thykier","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Abbie Cornish | James D'Arcy | Andrea Riseborough | Oscar Isaac","m_music_by":"Abel Korzeniowski","m_cinematography":"Hagen Bogdanski","m_edited_by":"Danny B.

(stylized as W./E.) is a 2011 British romantic drama film co-written and directed by Madonna. It stars Abbie Cornish, Andrea Riseborough, Oscar Isaac, Richard Coyle, and James D'Arcy. The screenplay was co-written by Alek Keshishian, who previously worked with Madonna on her 1991 documentary Truth or Dare and two of her music videos. The film was panned by critics and a box office bomb, returning only a small fraction of its budget in box office revenue. | The film tells the story of two women separated by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward's VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect as she thought. Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c \"Madonna the director: Star using tools of the trade to convince folk of her film-making skills on set of new movie W.E\".
