{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Ancient Egypt, Yocheved (Ofra Haza), a Hebrew mother, and her two children, Miriam and Aaron, watch in horror as the newborn Hebrew boys are taken and ruthlessly killed as ordered by Pharaoh Seti I (Patrick Stewart), who fears that an alarming increase could lead to rebellion. Fearing for her own newborn son's safety, Yocheved places him in a basket afloat on the Nile River, not before bidding him farewell with a final but powerful lullaby. Miriam follows the basket to the Pharaoh's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Queen Tuya (Helen Mirren), who names him Moses. | Years later, Moses (Val Kilmer) and his brother Rameses II (Ralph Fiennes) are scolded by their father for accidentally destroying a temple during one of their youthful misadventures, though Moses tries to take the blame. That evening at a palace banquet, Seti, who wants to give Rameses the opportunity to prove that he is responsible, names him Prince Regent and gives him authority over Egypt's temples. As a tribute, the high priests Hotep (Steve Martin) and Huy (Martin Short) offer him a beautiful young Midianite woman, Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Rameses gives her to Moses. Rameses then appoints him Royal Chief Architect. | Later that evening, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace and runs into his siblings Miriam (Sandra Bullock) and Aaron (Jeff Goldblum). Miriam is overjoyed to see her younger brother again, but Aaron is fearful to watch the confrontation. Despite Aaron's attempts to protect his sister, Miriam tries to tell Moses about his past, but he refuses to listen. Miriam then sings her mother's lullaby, which causes Moses to remember the melody. Moses runs to the palace, eager to return to familiar surroundings. The truth about his past is later confirmed by a nightmare, and finally by Seti himself. The next morning, Moses accidentally pushes an Egyptian guard off the scaffolding of the temple when trying to stop him from whipping a Hebrew slave, and the guard falls to his death. | Ashamed and confused, Moses flees into the desert in exile, despite Rameses' pleas to stay. While in the desert Moses defends three young girls from bandits, only to find out their older sister is Tzipporah, whom he helped escape from Egypt. Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, Jethro (Danny Glover). After assimilating this new culture, Moses becomes a shepherd and marries Tzipporah. While chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a burning bush through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh. | When Moses requests the Hebrews' release and changes his staff into an Egyptian cobra, to demonstrate his alliance with God, Hotep and Huy boastfully recreate this transformation, only to have their snakes eaten by Moses' snake. Rather than persuaded, Rameses doubles the Hebrews' workload. Moses and Tzipporah thereafter live with Miriam, who convinces Aaron and the other Hebrews to trust them. Later, Moses inflicts nine of the Plagues of Egypt, but Rameses refuses to relent despite each plague being worse than the one before. Against Moses' warning (foreshadowing the final plague), Rameses makes it clear that he will never release the Hebrew slaves. Disheartened by Rameses' words, Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth and final plague, instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark the doorposts with the lamb's blood. That night, the final plague kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, including Rameses' son, while sparing those of the Hebrews. The next day, a grief-stricken Rameses, mourning the loss of his son, finally gives Moses permission to free the Hebrews. Moses breaks down crying from the guilt of hurting Rameses, and from hearing the cries of numerous families across the city. | The following morning, the Hebrews leave Egypt, led by Moses, Miriam, Aaron, and Tzipporah. At the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses is closely pursuing them with his army. Upon the arrival, Moses uses his staff to part the sea, while a fire blocks the army's way. The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom; and when the fire vanishes and the army gives chase, the water closes over the Egyptian soldiers, sparing Rameses alone, who is washed ashore on the other side of the sea. Thereafter, Moses sadly bids farewell to his brother, and leads the Hebrews to Mount Sinai, where he receives the Ten Commandments.","m_cast":"Val Kilmer as Moses, a Hebrew who was adopted by Pharaoh Seti.

Due to the holiday season, the film gained 4% in its second weekend, earning $15.1 million and finishing in fourth place. It had a $4,698 average from 3,218 theaters. It would hold well in its third weekend, with only a 25% drop to $11,244,612 for a $3,511 average from 3,202 theaters and once again finishing in fourth place. The film closed on May 27, 1999 after earning $101.4 million in the United States and Canada with an additional $117.2 million overseas for a worldwide total of $218.6 million. The Prince of Egypt was the second non-Disney animated feature to gross over $100 million in the U.S. after Paramount/Nickelodeon's The Rugrats Movie. It remained the top grossing non-Disney animated film until being surpassed by the 2000 stop motion film Chicken Run, also distributed by DreamWorks, and remained the highest grossing traditionally animated non-Disney film until 2007, when it was out-grossed by 20th Century Fox's The Simpsons Movie.[23] | The film has a rating of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 84 reviews, with a weighted average score of 7/10. The site's consensus reads, \"The Prince of Egypt's stunning visuals and first-rate voice cast more than compensate for the fact that it's better crafted than it is emotionally involving.\"[24] Metacritic, which assigns a normalized 0â€“100 rating to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 64 from the 26 reviews it collected.[25] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film in his review saying, \"The Prince of Egypt is one of the best-looking animated films ever made. It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for them, and we sense the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the thrill of the chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children's entertainment.\"[26] Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave a negative review of the film saying, \"The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy.\"[27] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post praised the film saying, \"The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable.\"[28] | Lisa Alspector from the Chicago Reader praised the film and wrote, \"The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent.\"[29] Houston Chronicle's Jeff Millar reviewed by saying, \"The handsomely animated Prince of Egypt is an amalgam of Hollywood biblical epic, Broadway supermusical and nice Sunday school lesson.\"[30] James Berardinelli from Reelviews highly praised the film saying, \"The animation in The Prince of Egypt is truly top-notch, and is easily a match for anything Disney has turned out in the last decade\", and also wrote \"this impressive achievement uncovers yet another chink in Disney's once-impregnable animation armor.\"[31] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave a somewhat negative review and wrote, \"Prince of Egypt is spectacular but takes itself too seriously.\"[32] MovieGuide also reviewed the film favorably, giving it a rare 4 out of 4 stars, saying that, \"The Prince of Egypt takes animated movies to a new level of entertainment. Magnificent art, music, story, and realization combine to make The Prince of Egypt one of the most entertaining masterpieces of all time.\"[33] | The Prince of Egypt was banned in two countries where the population is predominantly Muslim: the Maldives and Malaysia, on the grounds that the depiction in the media of Islamic prophets (which includes Moses) is forbidden in Islam. The Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs in the Maldives stated: \"All prophets and messengers of God are revered in Islam, and therefore cannot be portrayed\".[34][35] Following this ruling, the censor board banned the film in January 1999. In the same month, the Film Censorship Board in Malaysia banned the film \"so as not to offend the country's majority Muslim population.\" The board's secretary said that the censor body ruled the film was \"insensitive for religious and moral reasons\".[36] Malaysia's population is 60% Muslim and they have strict censorship. Along with nudity and sex, sensitive religious scenes are rare due to the Malaysian film censorship laws.[36]","m_production":"Former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg had always wanted to do an animated adaption of The Ten Commandments. While working for The Walt Disney Company, Katzenberg suggested this idea to Michael Eisner, but he refused. The idea for the film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks SKG in 1994, when Katzenberg's partners, Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg, and music producer David Geffen, were meeting in Spielberg's living room.[6] Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said, \"You ought to do The Ten Commandments.\"[6] | The Prince of Egypt was \"written\" throughout the story process. Beginning with a starting outline, Story Supervisors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook led a team of fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire filmÂ â€” sequence by sequence. Once the storyboards were approved, they were put into the Avid Media Composer digital editing system by editor Nick Fletcher to create a \"story reel\" or animatic. The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began, and also helped the layout and animation departments understand what is happening in each sequence of the film.[7] After casting of the voice talent concluded, dialogue recording sessions began. For the film, the actors record individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors. The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances.[7] Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to call in Biblical scholars, Christian, Jewish and Muslim theologians, and Arab American leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original story. After previewing the developing film, all these leaders noted that the studio executives listened and responded to their ideas, and praised the studio for reaching out for comment from outside sources.[6] | Art directors Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and Production Designer Darek Gogol led a team of nine visual development artists in setting a visual style for the film that was representative of the time, the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt.[7] Part of the process also included the research and collection of artwork from various artists, as well as taking part in trips such as a two-week travel across Egypt by the filmmakers before the film's production began.[7] | Character Designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet worked on setting the design and overall look of the characters. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time.[7] Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments.[7] The Backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created.[7] | The animation team for The Prince of Egypt, including 350 artists from 34 different nations, was primarily recruited both from Walt Disney Feature Animation,[8] which had fallen under Katzenberg's auspices while at The Walt Disney Company, and from Amblimation, a defunct division of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment.[9] As at Disney's, character animators were grouped into teams by character: for example, Kristof Serrand, as the supervising animator of Older Moses, set the acting style of the character and assigned scenes to his team.[10] Consideration was given to properly depicting the ethnicities of the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Nubians seen in the film.[11] | There are 1192 scenes in the film, and 1180 contain work done by the special effects department, which animates everything in an animated scene which is not a character: blowing wind, dust, rainwater, shadows, etc. A blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery was used in the depictions of the ten plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea.[6][12] The animated characters were digitally inked and painted using Cambridge Systems' Animo software system (now merged with Toon Boom),[13] and the compositing of the 2D and 3D elements was done using the \"Exposure Tool\", a digital solution developed for DreamWorks by Silicon Graphics.[12][14] | The task of creating God's voice was given to Lon Bender and the team working with the film's music composer, Hans Zimmer.[15] \"The challenge with that voice was to try to evolve it into something that had not been heard before,\" says Bender. \"We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows, and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well. The solution was to use the voice of actor Val Kilmer to suggest the kind of voice we hear inside our own heads in our everyday lives, as opposed to the larger than life tones with which God has been endowed in prior cinematic incarnations.\"[15] As a result, in the final film, Kilmer gave voice to Moses and God, as well, yet the suggestion is that someone else would have heard God speak to them in their own voice.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Book of Exodus","m_directed_by":"Simon Wells | Brenda Chapman | Steve Hickner","m_produced_by":"Penney Finkelman Cox | Sandra Rabins","m_screenplay_by":"Philip LaZebnik | Nicholas Meyer","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Val Kilmer | Ralph Fiennes | Michelle Pfeiffer | Sandra Bullock | Jeff Goldblum | Patrick Stewart | Helen Mirren | Danny Glover | Steve Martin | Martin Short","m_music_by":"Hans Zimmer (Score) Stephen Schwartz (Songs)","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Nick Fletcher","m_production_company":"DreamWorks Animation","m_distributed_by":"DreamWorks Pictures1 (Amblin Partners)","m_release_dates":"DecemberÂ 16,Â 1998Â (1998-12-16) (premiere)[1] | DecemberÂ 18,Â 1998Â (1998-12-18) (United States)[2] |  |  | ","m_running_time":"99 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English Hebrew","m_budget":"$70 million[3]","m_box_office":"$218.6 million[3] | The Prince of Egypt is a 1998 American animated epic musical drama biblical film and the first traditionally animated film produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures. The film is an adaptation of the Book of Exodus and follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. The film was directed by Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells and Steve Hickner. The film featured songs written by Stephen Schwartz and a score composed by Hans Zimmer. The voice cast featured a number of major Hollywood actors in the speaking roles, while professional singers replaced them for the songs, except for Michelle Pfeiffer, Ralph Fiennes, Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Ofra Haza (who also sang her character's number, \"Deliver Us\", in seventeen other languages for the film's dubbing[4]), who sang their own parts. | Jeffrey Katzenberg had frequently suggested an animated adaption of the 1956 film The Ten Commandments while working for The Walt Disney Company, and he decided to put the idea into production after founding DreamWorks in 1995. To make this inaugural project, DreamWorks Animation employed artists who had worked for Walt Disney Feature Animation and the recently disbanded Amblimation, totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 different nations. The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery, created using software from Toon Boom Animation and Silicon Graphics. | The Prince of Egypt was released in theaters on December 18, 1998, and on home video on September 14, 1999. Reviews were positive, with critics praising the animation, music and voice work. The film went on to gross $218,613,188 worldwide in theaters, which made it the most successful non-Disney animated feature at the time. The film's success led to the direct-to-video prequel Joseph: King of Dreams (2000) and the development of a stage adaptation.[5] The song \"When You Believe\" became a commercially successful single in a pop version performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and went on to win Best Original Song at the 1999 Academy Awards. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b \"DreamWorks' `The Prince of Egypt' Attends UCLA's Royce Hall.\" (Press release).
