{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Living in Manhattan, Tom (Zach Braff) is a cook who has a hard time keeping his job. His wife, Sofia (Amanda Peet), is an attorney. When their first child is born, they agree that she will be a full-time mom and he will work hard to get a promotion. When Tom gets fired after defending his friend Paco (Yul Vazquez), he takes a job in Ohio working at the ad agency where his father-in-law is the assistant director. Tom is assigned to report to Chip (Jason Bateman). Chip is a strict and hard-working wheelchair-using man who is coincidentally Sofia's ex-boyfriend from high school. Chip still carries an obsession with her, so he conspires to make Tom's work life miserable. As Tom's frustrations mount, Chip begins to sway Sofia to his side. | Tom begins to suspect that Chip isn't handicapped at all and goes through his desk. He finds a photo of Chip playing tennis and rushes to his in-laws' house to see his wife and show her the picture. He finds Chip having dinner with Sofia and her parents and holding Tom's child. Tom mercilessly tries to prove that Chip isn't actually paralyzed by dragging him up a flight of stairs and then throws him, expecting him to stand up to prevent falling. Chip doesn't stand up and Tom is humiliated in front of his family. Later, he confronts Chip outside his house and attacks him, where Chip reveals that he really can walk, but can't fight outside of his chair. After sitting back down, Chip beats him severely and reveals that he plans to sleep with Sofia, much to Tom's already-increased rage. | It's revealed that Paco had called Chip under the guise of being an ad agency boss in Barcelona, telling Chip that he got a job and convincing him to fly to Spain. Excited by the news, Chip goes to Sofia and asks her to come with him. However, Tom accosts them both and convinces her not to go with Chip. Chip, angry that Sofia chose Tom over him, heartlessly mocks Tom and reveals he \"faked his orgasm\" to Sofia before getting out of his chair and walking out. While chastising them from outside, Chip is hit by a bus and ends up breaking both of his legs, crippling him for real. Tom and Sofia have moved out of Ohio and Sofia's dad is helping Tom start his own ad business. Tom and Sofia are shown to have switched positions, Tom becoming a stay-at-home dad while Sofia becomes a full-time worker. During the credits Chip is shown being tossed out of the ad company in Spain, and later on Tom's friend sees Chip in the middle of the running of the bulls on TV.","m_cast":"Zach Braff as Tom Reilly | Amanda Peet as Sofia Kowalski-Reilly | Jason Bateman as Chip Sanders | Charles Grodin as Bob Kowalski | Mia Farrow as Amelia Kowalski | Lucian Maisel as Wesley | Amy Poehler as Carol Lane | Paul Rudd as Leon | Fred Armisen as Manny | Donal Logue as Don Wollebin | Amy Adams as Abby March | Josh Charles as Forrest Mead | Marin Hinkle as Karen | Romany Malco as Hakeem Oliver | Yul Vazquez as Paco","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jesse Peretz","m_produced_by":"Anthony Bregman Marc Butan Anne Carey Ted Hope","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Zach Braff Amanda Peet Jason Bateman Charles Grodin Mia Farrow Donal Logue Amy Poehler Amy Adams Fred Armisen","m_music_by":"Edward Shearmur","m_cinematography":"Tom Richmond","m_edited_by":"Tricia Cooke","m_production_company":"This is that corporation 2929 Productions","m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer The Weinstein Company","m_release_dates":"December 2006 (2006-12) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"92 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$5,178,640 | The Ex is a 2006 comedy film directed by Jesse Peretz and starring Zach Braff, Amanda Peet and Jason Bateman.
