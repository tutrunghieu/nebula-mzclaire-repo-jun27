{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On October 30, Devil's Night in Detroit, Police Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is at the scene of a crime where Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) has been beaten and raped, and her fiancé Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) then died on the street outside, having been stabbed, shot, and thrown out of the window. The couple were to be married the following day, on Halloween. As he leaves for the hospital with Shelly, Albrecht meets a young girl, Sarah, who says that she is their friend, and that they take care of her. Albrecht tells her that Shelly is dying. | One year later, a crow taps on the grave stone of Eric Draven; Eric awakens and climbs out of his grave. Meanwhile, a low level street gang, headed by T-Bird (David Patrick Kelly), is setting fires in the city. Eric goes to his old apartment and finds it derelict. He has flashbacks to the murders, remembering that those responsible were T-Bird and his gang: Tin Tin, Funboy, and Skank. Eric soon discovers that any wounds he receives heal immediately. Guided by the crow, he sets out to avenge his and Shelly's murders by killing the perpetrators. | The crow helps Eric locate Tin Tin; Eric kills him by stabbing him in each vital organ (in alphabetical order) with his own knives and then takes his coat. He then goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin pawned Shelly's engagement ring the year before. Eric forces the owner, Gideon, to return the ring. Eric then tosses rings telling Gideon each of them is a life, a life Gideon helped destroy. He lets Gideon live so that he can warn the others, but when Gideon calls Eric street grease, he says, \"Is that gasoline I smell?\". Terrified, Gideon runs out and Eric blows up the shop, just as Gideon barely escapes. Eric finds Funboy getting high with Sarah's drug-addict mother, Darla. After killing Funboy with an overdose of morphine, Eric talks to Darla, taking the drug out of her arm seemingly by magic and making her realize that Sarah needs her to be a good mother. He visits Albrecht, explaining who he is and why he is here. Albrecht tells him what he knows about Shelly's death and that he watched as she suffered for thirty hours before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and receives from him the pain felt by Shelly during those hours. Sarah and her mother begin to repair their strained relationship. Sarah goes to Eric's apartment and talks to him. She tells him that she misses him and Shelly. Eric explains that, even though they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her. | As T-Bird and Skank stop at a convenience store to pick up some supplies, Eric arrives and kidnaps T-Bird. Skank follows the pair to the docks and witnesses Eric kill T-Bird by tying him to the driver's seat of his car and forcing him to drive it off the edge of the pier where it explodes and sinks into the harbour. Skank escapes and goes to Top Dollar, a top-level criminal who controls all the street gangs in the city. Top Dollar and his lover/half-sister Myca have become aware of Eric's actions through various reports from witnesses. Top Dollar holds a meeting with his associates where they discuss new plans for their Devil's Night criminal activities. Eric arrives looking for Skank. A gun fight ensures the deaths of nearly all present, and Eric kills Skank by throwing him out of a window. Top Dollar, Myca, and Grange, Top Dollar's right-hand man, escape. | Eric, having finished his quest, returns to his grave. Sarah goes to say goodbye to him and he gives her Shelly's engagement ring. She is abducted by Grange, who takes her into the church where Top Dollar and Myca are waiting. Through the crow, Eric realizes what has happened and goes to rescue her. Grange shoots the crow as it flies into the church, making Eric lose his invincibility. Myca grabs the wounded crow, intending to take its mystical power. Albrecht arrives, intending to pay his respects to Eric, just after Eric is shot and wounded. Top Dollar grabs Sarah and climbs the bell tower as a fight ensues, and Grange is killed by Albrecht. The crow escapes Myca's grip, pecking her eyes out and sending her down the bell tower to her death. When Albrecht is wounded, Eric climbs to the roof of the church on his own. There, Top Dollar admits ultimate responsibility for what happened to Eric and Shelly. In their fight, Eric, despite being fatally stabbed in the back, gives Top Dollar the thirty hours of pain he absorbed from Albrecht; the sensation sends Top Dollar over the roof of the church to be impaled on the horns of a gargoyle. Sarah and Albrecht go to the hospital, and Eric is reunited with Shelley at their graves. Sarah ends the film with a narration: \"If the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them. Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever.\"","m_cast":"Brandon Lee as Eric Draven/The Crow | Michael Wincott as Top Dollar | Ernie Hudson as Sgt.

The film opened at № 1 in the United States in 1,573 theaters with $11,774,332 and averaging $7,485 per theater.[10] The film ultimately grossed $50,693,129, above its $23 million budget. It ranked at #24 for all films released in the US in 1994 and 10 for R-rated films released that year.[11] | The Crow has an approval rating of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 50 reviews and an average rating of 7 out of 10. The critical consensus states: \"Filled with style and dark, lurid energy, The Crow is an action-packed visual feast that also has a soul in the performance of the late Brandon Lee.\"[12] The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics, indicating \"Generally favourable reviews.\"[13] | Reviewers praised the action and visual style.[14][15] Rolling Stone called it a \"dazzling fever dream of a movie\", Caryn James writing for The New York Times called it \"a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth\", and Roger Ebert called it \"a stunning work of visual style\".[15][16][17] The Los Angeles Times praised the film also.[18][19] | Lee's death was alleged to have a melancholic effect on viewers; Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote that Lee \"haunts every frame\" and James Berardinelli called the film \"a case of 'art imitating death', and that specter will always hang over The Crow\".[14][15][20] Berardinelli called it an appropriate epitaph to Lee, Howe called it an appropriate sendoff, and Ebert stated that not only was this Lee's best film, but it was better than any of his father's (Bruce Lee).[14][15][20] Critics generally thought that this would have been a breakthrough film for Lee, although James disagreed.[15][17][21] The changes made to the film after Lee's death were noted by reviewers, most of whom saw them as an improvement. Howe said that it had been transformed into something compelling.[14] James, although terming it a genre film, said that it had become more mainstream because of the changes.[17] | The film was widely compared to other films, particularly Tim Burton's Batman movies and Blade Runner.[20][21] Critics described The Crow as a darker film than the others;[17] Ebert called it a grungier and more forbidding story than those of Batman and Blade Runner, and Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the generic inner city of Detroit portrayed in The Crow \"makes Gotham City look like the Emerald City\".[21] | The distinctive features of the film for most critics were the fast-paced action and visual style. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski and the production design by Alex McDowell were praised. While the plot and characterization were found to be lacking,[14][17][21] these faults were considered to be overcome by the action and visual style.[15][20] The cityscape designed by McDowell and the production team was described by McCarthy as rendered imaginatively.[21] The film's comic book origins were noted, and Ebert called it the best version of a comic book universe he had seen.[15] McCarthy agreed, calling it \"one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip\".[21] Critics felt that the soundtrack complemented this visual style, calling it blistering, edgy and boisterous.[14][16][21] Graeme Revell was praised for his \"moody\" score;[21] Howe said that it \"drapes the story in a postmodern pall.\"[14] | Negative reviews of the film were generally similar in theme to the positive ones but said that the interesting and \"OK\" special effects did not make up for the \"superficial\" plot, \"badly-written\" screenplay and \"one-dimensional\" characters.[22][23] | The Crow is mentioned in Empire's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time; it ranked at number 468.[24] It has since become a cult film.[25] Then World Championship Wrestling star Sting got inspiration for his \"crow\" character from the movie. | In 1995, Graeme Revell won a BMI film music award for his score and Stone Temple Pilots won the MTV Movie Award for Best Song for \"Big Empty\".[26] Also at the MTV Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Best Film, and Brandon Lee was nominated for Best Male Performance.[26] The film received four Saturn Award nominations from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA, for Best Costumes, Best Director, Best Horror film and Best Special Effects. At the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards the film won Best Wide-Release Film and Brandon Lee won Best Actor.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"In 1996, a sequel was released, called The Crow: City of Angels. In this film, Vincent Pérez plays Ashe Corven, who, along with his son Danny, is killed by criminals. Ashe is resurrected as a new Crow. The character of Sarah (Mia Kirshner) reappears in this film and assists Ashe.[28] The film was followed by a television series and two direct-to-video sequels, each with a different person as The Crow. | The Crow: Stairway to Heaven was a 1998 Canadian television series created by Bryce Zabel and starring Mark Dacascos in the lead role as Eric Draven, reprising the role originally played by Brandon Lee. | The second sequel, The Crow: Salvation, was released in 2000. Directed by Bharat Nalluri, it stars Eric Mabius, Kirsten Dunst, Fred Ward, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and William Atherton. It is loosely based on Poppy Z. Brite's novel The Lazarus Heart. After its distributor cancelled the intended theatrical release due to The Crow: City of Angels' negative critical reception, The Crow: Salvation was released directly to video with mixed reviews. | The third sequel, The Crow: Wicked Prayer, was released in 2005. Directed by Lance Mungia, it stars Edward Furlong, David Boreanaz, Tara Reid, Tito Ortiz, Dennis Hopper, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Danny Trejo. It was inspired by Norman Partridge's novel of the same title. It had a one-week theatrical première on June 3, 2005, at AMC Pacific Place Theatre in Seattle, Washington, before being released to video on July 19, 2005. Like the other sequels, it had a poor critical reception, and it was considered the worst of the four films. | The Crow: 2037 was a planned sequel/reboot written and scheduled to be directed by Rob Zombie in the late 1990s;[29] however, it was never made.[30][31][32]","m_based_on":"The Crow  by James O'Barr","m_directed_by":"Alex Proyas","m_produced_by":"Jeff Most | Edward R.

Schow and John Shirley, and starring Brandon Lee in his final film appearance. Based on James O'Barr's 1989 comic book of the same name, it tells the story of Eric Draven (Lee), a rock musician who is revived from the dead to avenge his own death as well as the rape and murder of his fiancée. | The lead actor, Brandon Lee, was accidentally killed on the set during filming by a defective blank, only 8 days before the film would have completed production.[3] Unfinished scenes that were to feature him were dealt with by script rewrites, a stunt double and digital special effects. The film is dedicated to Lee and his fiancée, Eliza. | Despite the several production setbacks due to Lee's death, The Crow was well-received critically for its unique visual style, premise, emotional depth and its tribute to the deceased actor. The film opened at the top of the box office and attained a strong cult following. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca (May 13, 1994), \"How the Crow Flew\", Entertainment Weekly (Time Inc.), retrieved March 12, 2011  | ^ \"The Crow\".
