{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set shortly after the World War II (1945 and 1946) in one of the suburbs of Prague (it was shot in Michle). The main character Eda Souček (Václav Jakoubek) attends a boys' elementary school where he belongs to a class with a complete lack of discipline. After their teacher Maxová (Daniela Kolářová) goes insane during one of her classes, the schoolmaster (Rudolf Hrušínský) has to implement special measures. He employs a new male teacher Igor Hnízdo (Jan Tříska), who is said to be a great war hero. Authoritative Hnízdo immediately introduces corporal punishment which, as he explains, is not normally allowed but the school has received an exception from the Ministry of Education as a result of their dreadful behaviour. Despite his strict methods, the boys soon become charmed by the man. They love his battlefront stories and the fact that he is always armed and wears a uniform. Eda sees him as the very opposite of his own father (Zdeněk Svěrák) whom he considers to be too cowardly. Hnízdo makes the same positive impression on all people he meets (including Eda's mother portrayed by Libuše Šafránková). Nevertheless, his persona is also surrounded by many controversies. For example his war heroism is disputed as he is unable to provide any accurate information about his military service. There is even an unconfirmed rumour that Hnízdo was only guarding goats during the war. But the boys from his class ignore all negative comments and even fight those who are spreading the rumours. Hnízdo's reputation suffers after he is accused of having a sexual relationship with local twins who attend a girls' school in the same area. He is forced to leave because this is not the first time he has been involved in a similar affair. The formerly unmanageable boys begin to defend Hnízdo and call for his return. The accusation is finally withdrawn and Hnízdo comes back to the class. He states that the way they were dealing with the accusation is a proof that the physical punishments are no longer necessary.","m_cast":"Václav Jakoubek as Eda Souček | Radoslav Budác as Tonda | Jan Tříska as Igor Hnízdo | Zdeněk Svěrák as František Souček | Libuše Šafránková as Mrs. Součková | Rudolf Hrušínský as schoolmaster | Rudolf Hrušínský Jr. as Tonda's father | Eva Holubová as Tonda's mother | Petr Čepek as Josef Mrázek (aka fakir Rádži Tamil) | Boleslav Polívka as Plíha | Ondřej Vetchý as tram driver | Irena Pavlásková as tram driver's wife | Daniela Kolářová as teacher Maxová","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The original story was written by Zdeněk Svěrák.
