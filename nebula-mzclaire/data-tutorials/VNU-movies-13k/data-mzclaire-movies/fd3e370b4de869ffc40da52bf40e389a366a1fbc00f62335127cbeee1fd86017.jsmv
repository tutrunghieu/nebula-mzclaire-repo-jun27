{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) waits in the car while her actress mother, Amanda (Malin Åkerman), auditions for a film. When she returns, Amanda complains that, for the rest of her career, she'll be known for her role as scream queen Nancy in the 1986 slasher film Camp Bloodbath, now a cult classic. On the way home, the two get into a car accident, leaving Max as the only survivor. | Three years later, on the anniversary of her mom's death, Max studies with her best friend Gertie (Alia Shawkat) and crush Chris (Alexander Ludwig). Gertie's stepbrother Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), a horror super fan, shows up and convinces Max to attend a special double-feature showing of Camp Bloodbath and its sequel, Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer, as a special guest. At the screening, Max is none too happy to find Chris' possessive ex-girlfriend Vicki (Nina Dobrev) there. During the film, the raucous crowd accidentally sets the theater ablaze. In order to get to safety, Max rips a hole through the screen. | Max, Chris, Gertie, Duncan, and Vicki find themselves waking up in the woods. They encounter characters from Camp Bloodbath, including Max's mother, in character as nice girl Nancy, and they realize they've somehow been transported inside the movie. The group awkwardly pass themselves off as new camp counselors arriving for the season, and let the first couple of murders happen without interference. However, when Duncan is killed by Camp Bloodbath's machete-wielding villain Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris), they realize that they also run the risk of being murdered. | The group decides to stop the characters from having sex, as whenever someone does so in Camp Bloodbath, they fall prey to Billy's machete. Chris distracts horn dog Kurt (Adam DeVine) and Max persuades Nancy to stay a virgin, while Vicki sticks with the movie's final girl Paula (Chloe Bridges) and Gertie bonds with counselor Blake (Tory N. Thompson). When Gertie brings up the topic of Billy Murphy, the counselors are alerted to the fact that \"urban legend\" Billy is \"real\" and will come to kill them. In a panic, the counselors try to flee the camp. Kurt and Paula flee in the car, while Duncan emerges still alive. The two hit Duncan with the car and crash into a totem pole, resulting in their deaths. | Now aware that the characters who originally survived the movie can die, Max and the others decide to save anyone they can. They dress flirty airhead Tina (Angela Trimbur) in a life jacket and mittens, to prevent her from undressing. They also decide that Max, the only remaining virgin, is the new final girl, and plot to get Billy's machete into her hands so she can kill him and end the film. Meanwhile, Max and Nancy bond, and theorize that, if Nancy survives the movie, she can go back home with Max and be whomever she wants to be. | The group booby trap the cabin, and Tina lures Billy to them by performing a striptease. However, Tina becomes frightened when he arrives. She runs from Billy but trips over a wire and falls into a bear trap, killing her. Subsequently, Blake, Vicki and Gertie are killed while trying to defeat Billy. Chris, Nancy, and Max flee the cabin, and Billy chases after them. Chris is stabbed, and Billy kidnaps Nancy. Max leaves Chris at an abandoned chapel in the woods and goes to rescue Nancy, though Chris tells her that Nancy can't be saved. Max finds her at Billy's barn hideout, and the two women fight him, which results in Max getting stabbed, before they both escape. | After returning to the chapel, Nancy realizes that only one of them can be the final girl, and that Max will not be able to defeat Billy unless Nancy dies. Nancy sacrifices herself by luring Billy with a striptease, but not before Max tells her Nancy's real life counterpart is her mother. They bid each other a tearful farewell before Nancy is killed, causing Max to collapse. Now the final girl, she awakens with the power to kill Billy. Max then battles Billy, and eventually decapitates him with his own machete. A wounded Chris arrives and the two kiss, while Camp Bloodbath's closing credits play in the sky. Later, Max wakes to find herself in the hospital, alive and reunited with her friends. Just then, the group hears Billy Murphy's approach tune, and realize they're in the sequel, Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer. Billy crashes through the glass doors of the hospital as the title appears. Using a drip stand as a weapon, Max lunges at Billy, before the film abruptly ends.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Final Girls received positive reviews from film critics. It holds a 70% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Final Girls offers an affectionate nod to slasher tropes while adding a surprising layer of genuine emotion to go with the meta amusement.\"[66] On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 59 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[67] | The film was ranked #9 on BuzzFeed's 19 Best Horror Films of 2015 list,[68] and ranked #10 on Rolling Stone's 10 Best Horror Movies of 2015 list.[69] | Dennis Harvey of Variety gave a positive review, writing: \"Though not quite as inspired or consistent as the similarly self-mocking likes of The Cabin in the Woods, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil or the first two Scream pics, this is good fun that should delight genre fans.\"[70] Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"Genre enthusiasts will get a kick out of Todd Strauss-Schulson's creative homage to classic slasher movies, which respects familiar horror conventions while introducing a sly contemporary perspective.\"[71] Laura Kern of Film Comment called the film a \"sharp, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly heartfelt homage\" to slasher films, adding: \"It's a gimmicky premise, perhaps, but a highly effective one. No mere meta-exercise, the film innovatively blends the worlds of the 1986 teens of Camp Bloodbath with the modern-day ones.\"[72]","m_production":"\"It's Pleasantville in a trashy horror movie from the 80s with a little Back to the Future thrown in, and a spoon full of Terms of Endearment with a dash of Scream and two dollops of Purple Rose of Cairo for good measure.\" | In February 2014, it was reported that Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions had bought the rights to the film under the Stage 6 Films banner, with Michael London and his company Groundswell Productions producing the feature. The film was originally picked up by New Line Cinema in November 2011, but the script was shopped elsewhere when production did not get off the ground.[6] The screenplay was written by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, and was directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson.[7] Miller's father, Jason Miller, was an actor and writer who appeared as Father Karras in The Exorcist. The script for The Final Girls was in part inspired by The Exorcist, with Miller pointing out: \"I grew up watching my dad in The Exorcist, and there's something haunting, strange, confusing, and a little bit unnatural to see your parent constantly die in a film. But it's something that also becomes iconic, and we tried to deconstruct what the effects of that would be, as well as what it would be like if you had a second chance, but your second chance was inside of a movie?\"[8] Miller and Fortin also served as executive producers, alongside Darren M. Demetre.[9] | It was announced on February 27, 2014, that Malin Åkerman and Taissa Farmiga had been cast in the two main roles for the film, playing mother-daughter Amanda and Max Cartwright, respectively.[10][11][12] On April 10, 2014, it was revealed that Thomas Middleditch, Alexander Ludwig, Nina Dobrev, and Adam DeVine had joined the cast in supporting roles.[13] Middleditch stars as Duncan, the \"film geek\"; Ludwig portrays Chris, the love interest of Max; Dobrev plays Vicki, the ex-girlfriend of Chris; and DeVine stars as Kurt, the movie-within-a-movie's \"teen seducer\".[14] Alia Shawkat, Chloe Bridges, and Angela Trimbur also joined the cast of the film, portraying Gertie, Paula, and Tina, respectively.[15] | Principal photography was reported to last for 26 days in Baton Rouge and St. Francisville, Louisiana.[16] Production for the film began on April 22, 2014,[17][18] with an estimated budget of $4.5 million.[1] On April 23, 2014, a photo from the set was revealed by one of the cast.[19][20] Over 200 extras were sought out for large scenes.[16] Principal photography for the film concluded on May 25, 2014.[21] In late October 2014, some of the cast and crew returned for pick-ups and scene re-shoots following a test screening earlier that month.[22] | Post-production primarily took place in New York City,[23] with additional editing taking place at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.[24] Sound mixing was provided by Parabolic in New York City. On October 2, 2014, an edit of the film was screened in Los Angeles to a test audience of teenagers.[25] Following this, some of the cast and crew returned for re-shoots and pick-ups.[22] On December 22, 2014, Strauss-Schulson stated that post-production had been completed for the film.[26] According to Strauss-Schulson, the film was required to be rated PG-13, at the studio's request.[27]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Todd Strauss-Schulson","m_produced_by":"Michael London | Janice Williams","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Taissa Farmiga | Malin Åkerman | Adam DeVine | Thomas Middleditch | Alia Shawkat | Alexander Ludwig | Nina Dobrev","m_music_by":"Gregory James Jenkins","m_cinematography":"Elie Smolkin","m_edited_by":"Debbie Berman","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Stage 6 Films | Vertical Entertainment","m_release_dates":"March 13, 2015 (2015-03-13) (SXSW) | October 9, 2015 (2015-10-09) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"91 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$4.5 million[1] | The Final Girls is a 2015 American slasher comedy film, directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson and written by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller.
