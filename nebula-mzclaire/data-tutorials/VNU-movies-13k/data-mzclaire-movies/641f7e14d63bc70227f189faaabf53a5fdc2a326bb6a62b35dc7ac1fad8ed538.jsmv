The opening line is \"I wouldn't say no to a woman or a job\". | The movie flips between reality and unreality in a variety of ways, with the time, language and setting unclear. The leading characters all display traits of the opposite of what they seem to be (the heroic ex-cop, for example, is a convicted murderer; the protective mother abandons her child; criminals show themselves to be sensitive philosophers; the wayward husband loves his wife; the straight woman shows a dark past; etc.). | There are déjà vus and some uncanny look-alike side characters that turn up in separate times and places, adding somewhat to the dream- or nightmare-like quality of the movie. | The four main characters convene by ones and pairs, get involved with one another, are joined by others, and end up in a final and absurd overall showdown to separate again. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ FILM COMPANY MAKES HIT MOVIES ON MINI-BUDGETS: ISLAND ALIVE'S HIT MOVIE FORMULA Pollock, Dale.
