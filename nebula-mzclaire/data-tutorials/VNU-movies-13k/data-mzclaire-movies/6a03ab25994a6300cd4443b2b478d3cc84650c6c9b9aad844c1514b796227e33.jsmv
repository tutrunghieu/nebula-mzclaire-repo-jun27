{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bartholomew \"Barley\" Scott-Blair (Sean Connery), the head of a British publishing firm, is on a business trip to Moscow. He attends a writers' retreat near Peredelkino where he speaks of an end to tensions with the West. Attentively listening is a mysterious man called 'Dante' (Klaus Maria Brandauer). Dante later demands from Barley a promise to do the right thing if the opportunity arises. | A few months later, unable to locate Barley at a trade show, a beautiful young Soviet woman named Katya Orlova (Michelle Pfeiffer) asks publisher Nicky Landau (Nicholas Woodeson) to give Barley an important manuscript in her possession. Landau sneaks a look at the manuscript and delivers it to British government authorities. The manuscript is a document detailing the Soviet Union's capability for waging nuclear war. An investigation reveals 'Dante' is in fact renowned Soviet physicist Yakov Saveleyev and the author of the manuscript. | British intelligence officers officers track Barley to his holiday flat in Lisbon, Portugal and interrogate him as to how he knows Katya. They realize he is as much in the dark as they are. MI6 realizes that the manuscript is also of vital importance to the American CIA, with both agencies wanting Barley to work on their behalf. British agent Ned (James Fox) then gives Barley some fundamental training as a spy. | Barley returns to the Soviet Union to seek out Dante/Yakov and confirm he is a genuine informant. He meets with Katya, with whom he is instantly smitten. Through her, he confirms that Dante is indeed the brilliant scientist Saveleyev. Barkley also denies to Katya that he is a spy. | The British run the operation through its first phase while apprising the CIA of its results. The CIA team, headed by Russell (Roy Scheider), is worried because the manuscript states that the Soviet nuclear missile program is in complete disarray, which suggests the USA has engaged in a useless arms race. | Katya sets up a meeting with Dante, going to great lengths to avoid being followed. Barley explains that the manuscript is now in the hands of British and American authorities. Yakov feels betrayed, but Barley convinces him that the manuscript can still be published. Dante gives Barley another volume of the manuscript after Barley assures him that he's sympathetic to the scientist's cause. | Impressed by the additional volume, Russell's boss Brady (John Mahoney) and U.S. military officer Quinn (J. T. Walsh) interrogate Barley to be certain where his loyalties lie. Russell states he would help the British operation out of a true ideological belief in Glasnost, although this would not be good news to his 'customers' of the weapons industry, who need an arms race for continued prosperity. | Convinced that Dante's manuscripts are truthful, the CIA and MI6 come up with a \"shopping list\" list of questions which is meant to extract as much strategic warfare information as Dante can provide. \"Russia House\" handler Ned senses something is amiss with Barley but the British-American team continues with its plans. | Barley returns to Russia and declares his love to Katya and admits he is an operative. Katya confesses that Yakov is not acting like himself and fears he may be under KGB observation or control. She gives Barley the address where Yakov will be staying when he is in Moscow. | Barley is under full British-American surveillance as he takes the shopping list to Yakov's apartment. Ned suddenly concludes that the Soviets know all about the operation and that they only let it run because they want to steal the 'shopping list' to learn exactly what the British and Americans know. | Ned is now convinced that Barley has made a deal to turn over the questions to the USSR. Russell disagrees and instructs the assignment to proceed as planned. The British-American team expects the meeting with Yakov to last a short time, but when Barley doesn't return after seven hours, Russell admits he was wrong. The team must now pretend the questions were deliberately false. | Barley, meanwhile, sends a note Ned explaining that during a pre-arranged phone call to Katya, Dante used a code word to let her know that he had been compromised by the KGB and that her life is in danger. Barley admits he traded the shopping list to the Russians in exchange for the safety and freedom of Katya and her family. He admits that his actions might be unfair, but tells Ned, \"you shouldn't open other people's letters.\" | Barley returns to his flat in Lisbon, where he waits for Katya and her family to begin a new life with him.","m_cast":"Sean Connery as Bartholomew \"Barley\" Scott Blair | Michelle Pfeiffer as Katya Orlova | Roy Scheider as Russell | James Fox as Ned | John Mahoney as Brady | Michael Kitchen as Clive | J.

The Russia House doesn't sweep you off your feet; it works more insidiously than that, flying in under your radar. If it is like any of its characters, it's like Katya. It's reserved, careful to declare itself but full of potent surprises. It's one of the year's best films.\"[5] Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \"At its best, The Russia House offers a rare and enthralling spectacle: the resurrection of buried hopes.\"[6] Time Out less enthusiastically wrote: \"Overtaken by East-West events, and with an over-optimistic ending which sets personal against political loyalty, it's still highly enjoyable, wittily written, and beautiful to behold in places, at others somehow too glossy for its own good.\"[7] | Tom Stoppard's adapted screenplay was criticised by Vincent Canby in the New York Times: \"There is evidence of Mr. Stoppard's wit in the dialogue, but the lines are not easily spoken, which is not to say that they are unspeakable. They are clumsy.\"[8] Roger Ebert held a similar view in the Chicago Sun-Times: \"What's good are the few emotional moments that break out of the weary spy formula: Connery declaring his love for Pfeiffer, or the British and Americans getting on each other's nerves. But these flashes of energy are isolated inside a screenplay that is static and boring, that drones on lifelessly through the le Carré universe, like some kind of space probe that continues to send back random information long after its mission has been accomplished.\"[9] | Sean Connery was praised for his portrayal of Barley, \"bluff, incorrigible, jazz-loving... his finest performance in ages.\"[7] Variety wrote: \"As the flawed, unreliable publisher, Connery is in top form.\"[1] Peter Travers in Rolling Stone thought he captured \"the 'splendid quiet' that le Carré found in Blair.\"[6] Hal Hinson in the Washington Post wrote: \"This may be the most complex character Connery has ever played, and without question it's one of his richest performances. Connery shows the melancholy behind Barley's pickled charm, all the wasted years and unkept promises.\"[5] Desson Howe, also in the Washington Post, wrote: \"Sean Connery, like Anthony Quinn, takes a role like a vitamin pill, downs it, then goes about his bighearted business of making the part his idiosyncratic own.\"[10] However, he received criticism from the New York Times, who thought that the \"usually magnetic Mr. Connery... is at odds with Barley, a glib, lazy sort of man who discovers himself during this adventure. Mr. Connery goes through the movie as if driving in second gear.\"[8] | Michelle Pfeiffer also garnered critical plaudits for delivering \"the film's most persuasive performance... Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie,\"[8] according to the New York Times. Desson Howe in the Washington Post wrote: \"As Katya, a mother who risks her love to smuggle a document and falls for a Westerner in the process, her gestures are entirely believable, her accent (at least to one set of Western ears) is quietly perfect.\"[10] Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote that \"Pfeiffer, who gets more subtle and incisive with each film, is incandescent as Katya.\"[6] Hal Hinson in the Washington Post congratulated her for portraying a rounded character: \"Her triumph goes beyond her facility with the Russian accent; other actresses could have done that. She's great at playing contradictions, at being tough yet yielding, cloaked yet open, direct yet oblique. What's she's playing, we suspect, is the great Russian game of hide-and-seek. But Pfeiffer gives it a personal dimension. Katya holds herself in check, but her wariness, one senses, is as much personal as it is cultural -- the result, perhaps, of her own secret wounds. It's one of the year's most full-blooded performances.\"[5] However, Pfeiffer also had her detractors. Variety thought that her \"Russian accent proves very believable but she has limited notes to play.\"[1] Time Out wrote that \"Pfeiffer can act, but her assumption of a role for which her pouty glamour is inappropriate - a Russian office-worker seen rubbing shoulders in the bus queues - is a jarring note.\"[7]","m_production":"The Russia House was filmed on location in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia,[2] the first major American production to be filmed substantially in the Soviet Union.[1] The final scenes were filmed on location in Lisbon, Portugal.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Russia House  by John le Carré","m_directed_by":"Fred Schepisi","m_produced_by":"Paul Maslansky Neil Canton Fred Schepisi","m_screenplay_by":"Tom Stoppard","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sean Connery | Michelle Pfeiffer | Roy Scheider | James Fox | John Mahoney | Klaus Maria Brandauer","m_music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith","m_cinematography":"Ian Baker","m_edited_by":"Beth Jochem Besterveld Peter Honess","m_production_company":"Pathé Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"December 25, 1990 (1990-12-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"122 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$22,998,000 (USA) | The Russia House is a 1990 American spy film directed by Fred Schepisi.
