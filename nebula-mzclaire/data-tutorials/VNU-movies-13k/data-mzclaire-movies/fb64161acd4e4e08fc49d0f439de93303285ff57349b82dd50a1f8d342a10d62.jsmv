{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) is a young man from an impoverished background, but with a promising future in law. About to graduate from Harvard Law School near the top of his class, he receives a generous job offer from Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a small, boutique firm in Memphis specializing in accounting and tax law. He and his wife, Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn), move to Memphis and Mitch sets to work studying to pass the Tennessee bar exam. Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), one of the firm's senior partners, becomes his mentor and begins introducing Mitch to BL&Ls professional culture, which demands complete loyalty, strict confidentiality, and a willingness to charge exceptional fees for their services. Seduced by the money and perks showered on him, including a house and car, he is at first totally oblivious to the more sinister side of his new employer, although Abby has her suspicions. | Mitch passes the bar exam and begins working long hours that put a strain on his marriage. Working closely with Avery, Mitch learns that most of the Firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide large amounts of money in off-shore shell corporations and other dubious tax-avoidance schemes. While on a trip to the Cayman Islands on behalf of a client, Mitch is seduced by a local woman and cheats on Abby. Unbeknownst to Mitch, this encounter is a set-up and their tryst on the beach is photographed by people working for the firm's sinister security chief, Bill DeVasher (Wilford Brimley), who later uses these photographs as blackmail to keep Mitch quiet about what he knows. | Mitch realizes he is now trapped, but after two associates of the firm die under mysterious circumstances, he is approached by FBI agents who inform him that while some of BL&L's business is legitimate, their biggest client is the Morolto Mafia family from Chicago. The firm's partners, as well as most of the associates, are all complicit in a massive tax fraud and money laundering scheme. The two associates who died learned about the firm's dark side, and were killed to keep them from talking. They warn Mitch that his house, car, and office have probably all been bugged. The FBI pressures Mitch to provide the Bureau with evidence they can use to go after the Moroltos and bring down BL&L. Mitch knows he faces a stark choice. If he works with the FBI, he believes that even if he stays alive, he will have to disclose information about the firm's legitimate clients—thus breaking the attorney–client privilege and risking disbarment. However, the FBI warns him that he stays with the firm, he will almost certainly go to jail when the FBI takes down both the firm and the Moroltos. Either way, his life as he knows it is over. He agrees to cooperate with the FBI in return for $1.5 million and the release of his brother, Ray, from prison in Arkansas. | Desperate to find a way out, Mitch inadvertently stumbles on a solution when one of his clients reveals that he was billed for an extra five hours. Mitch eventually discovers that while the firm is laundering money for the Moroltos, it has also been engaging in massive overbilling. By mailing these bills to their clients, they committed mail fraud, and did so at such a rate that it exposes them to RICO charges. He begins secretly copying the firm's billing records. However, he is unmasked when a prison guard on the Moroltos' payroll alerts DeVasher. Evading DeVasher and his thugs, he finds the Morolto brothers and, offering himself as a loyal attorney looking out for his clients' best interests, leads them to believe that his contact with the FBI and copying files at the firm was merely an attempt to expose illegal overbilling. He asks the Moroltos to turn over their billing invoices in order to help the FBI make their case against the firm. He assures them that as long as he is alive, any other information he knows about their legal affairs is covered under attorney-client privilege and will never be revealed. Understanding the deal he is offering them, the Moroltos agree to guarantee Mitch's safety and let him give the FBI all the evidence they need to destroy the firm. Since the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply when a lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity, Mitch is able to keep his status as a lawyer. | The film ends as the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis and return to Boston, driving the same car in which they arrived.","m_cast":"Tom Cruise as Mitch McDeere, a promising recent Harvard Law graduate. | Jeanne Tripplehorn as Abigail \"Abby\" McDeere, Mitch's wife. | Gene Hackman as Avery Tolar, Mitch's mentor at the Firm. | Holly Hunter as Tamara \"Tammy\" Hemphill, Eddie's chain-smoking secretary and lover who greatly aids Mitch McDeere in copying and stealing the files in Memphis and later the Cayman Islands. | Ed Harris as Agent Wayne Tarrance, the agent in charge of the investigation into the Firm; Mitch's primary contact with the FBI. | Hal Holbrook as Oliver Lambert, senior partner at the Firm. | Jerry Hardin as Royce McKnight, managing partner at the Firm. | David Strathairn as Ray McDeere, Mitch's brother who was in jail for a manslaughter conviction | Terry Kinney as Lamar Quinn, Mitch's friend who works at the Firm. | Wilford Brimley as Bill DeVasher, officially the head of security at the Firm—unofficially the Firm's main hitman. | Sullivan Walker as Thomas Abanks, the owner of a scuba diving business. | Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, a private investigator and former cell-mate of Ray McDeere. | Steven Hill as F.
