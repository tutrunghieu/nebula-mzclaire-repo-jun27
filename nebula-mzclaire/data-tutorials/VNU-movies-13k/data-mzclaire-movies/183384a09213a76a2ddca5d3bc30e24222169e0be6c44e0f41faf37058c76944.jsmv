He ruthlessly murders his father by sabotaging the old man's shotgun, consequently inheriting the title of Baron von Frankenstein and the family fortune. He uses the money to enter medical school in Vienna, but is forced to return home when he impregnates the daughter of the Dean. | Returning to his own castle, he sets up a laboratory and starts a series of experiments involving the revival of the dead. He eventually builds a composite body from human parts, which he then brings to life. The creature goes on a homicidal rampage until it is accidentally destroyed when a vat where it has been hidden is flooded with acid.","m_cast":"Ralph Bates as Baron Victor Frankenstein | Kate O'Mara as Alys | Veronica Carlson as Elizabeth Heiss | Dennis Price as The Graverobber | Jon Finch as Lieutenant Henry Becker | Bernard Archard as Professor Heiss | Graham James as Wilhelm Kassner | James Hayter as Bailiff | Joan Rice as Graverobber's wife | Stephen Turner as Stephan | Neil Wilson as Schoolmaster | James Cossins as Dean | Glenys O'Brien as Maggie | Geoffrey Lumsden as Instructor | Chris Lethbridge-Baker as Priest | Terry Duggan as First Bandit | George Belbin as Baron Frankenstein | Hal Jeayes as Woodsman | Carol Jeayes as Woodsman's Daughter | Michael Goldie as Workman | David Prowse as The Monster","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was entirely financed by EMI.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jimmy Sangster","m_produced_by":"Jimmy Sangster","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ralph Bates Kate O'Mara Veronica Carlson David Prowse","m_music_by":"Malcolm Williamson","m_cinematography":"Moray Grant","m_edited_by":"Chris Barnes","m_production_company":"EMI Elstree Hammer Film Productions Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_distributed_by":"MGM-EMI1","m_release_dates":"8 November 1970 (1970-11-08) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"95 min.","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"₤200,000[1] | The Horror of Frankenstein is a 1970 British horror film by Hammer Film Productions that is both a semi-parody and remake of the 1957 film The Curse of Frankenstein.
