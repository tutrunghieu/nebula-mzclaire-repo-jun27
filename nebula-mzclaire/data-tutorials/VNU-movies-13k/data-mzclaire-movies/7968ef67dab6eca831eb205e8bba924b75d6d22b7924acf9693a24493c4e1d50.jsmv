The sailors who run the ship are tattooed with solitary letters and supposedly never defecate. On one occasion, the sailor claims to have been imprisoned in another sailor's body, and as he wanders around the boat in bewilderment, encounters multiple visions of himself from this different perspective. | The story continues to unfold through the sailor's multiple docking experiences. Among these, he encounters a porcelain doll loving prostitute, Maria; a young boy he feels paternal responsibility towards in Singapore; and the \"Femme Fatale\", Mathilde, a nude dancer who haunts his desires with her cutting words articulated from her solitary orifice. | The tale returns to the sailor and student, when the sailor demands his 3 Dutch crowns he owes to his Captain as a gambling debt. The inebriated pair return to the initial murder scene where the student retrieves the last Crown from his professor's deceased hand. They head to the dock where the Fuchalense awaits. The student demands his payment, and when the sailor tells him he hasn't earned the job, the student bludgeons the sailor to death.
