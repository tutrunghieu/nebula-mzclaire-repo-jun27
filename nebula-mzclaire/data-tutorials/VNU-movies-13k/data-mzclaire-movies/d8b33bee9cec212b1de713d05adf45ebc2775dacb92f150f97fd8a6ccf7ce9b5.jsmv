He is actually smooth-talking conman 'Soapy' Stevens, who proposes a large-scale diamond robbery. They will also have the ultimate alibi; they will break out of prison, commit the robbery and then break back in. | With the assistance of Dodger's girlfriend Ethel and Lennie's mum, they smuggle themselves out in a prison van. The operation is almost foiled by the disciplinarian 'Sour' Crout, the new Chief Prison Officer who is replacing the easy-going retiring Jenkins. | The diamond heist goes like clockwork and the three break back into prison, hiding the proceeds in the Governor's office. When they 'officially' leave prison, they manage to take the loot with them. All goes well, until the sack of diamonds is lost on a train. Stevens is recognised and arrested, but the others get away - minus the diamonds.","m_cast":"Peter Sellers as Dodger Lane | Lionel Jeffries as Prison Officer 'Sour' Crout | Wilfrid Hyde-White as Soapy Stevens | Bernard Cribbins as Lennie (The Dip) Price | David Lodge as Jelly Knight | Irene Handl as Mrs Price | Liz Fraser as Ethel | Maurice Denham as Horatio Bennett, the Prison Governor | Beryl Reid as Miss Pringle | George Woodbridge as Chief Prison Officer Jenkins | Edwin Brown as Warder Charlie | Cyril Chamberlain as Gate Warder - Day | Wallas Eaton as Gate Warder - Night | William Abney as Visiting Room Warder | Thorley Walters as Colonel Parkright | John Wood as Captain | Robert James as Police Superintendent | Walter Hudd as Reverend Patterson | Mario Fabrizi as Jones | Warren Mitchell as Tailor | John Glyn-Jones as Lawyer | Arthur Mullard as Fred | Ian Wilson as Milkman | Edward Dentith as Detective | John Harvey as Governor Rockhampton Prison","m_reception":"The film was the 4th most popular movie at the British box office in 1960.","m_production":"The prison scenes were filmed at the West Cavalry Barracks at Aldershot, and the security van robbery at Pirbright Arch in the village of Brookwood in Surrey.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Day","m_produced_by":"E.M.
