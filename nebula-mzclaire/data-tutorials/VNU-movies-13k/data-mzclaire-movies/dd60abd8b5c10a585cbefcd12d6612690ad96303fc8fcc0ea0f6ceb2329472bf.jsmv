{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"At a college pre-med student fraternity New Year's Eve party, a reluctant Alana Maxwell is coerced into participating in a prank: she lures the shy and awkward pledge Kenny Hampson into a darkened room on the promise of a sexual liaison. However some other students have placed a woman's corpse in the bed. Kenny is traumatised by the prank and is sent to a psychiatric hospital. | Three years later the members of the same fraternities and sororities hold a New Year's costume party aboard a train. Class clown Ed is disguised as Groucho Marx. Prank ringleader Doc Manley is disguised as a monk. Jackson is disguised as an alien lizard. Doc's girlfriend, Alana's best friend Mitchy, is disguised as a witch. Alana's boyfriend Mo is disguised as a bird. Also along are Carne, the train conductor, and a magician hired to entertain the crowd. | As the train journeys into the icy wilderness, the students responsible for the prank are murdered one by one, with the killer assuming the mask and costume of each murder victim in turn. Carne discovers some bodies and sequesters the students in one car as the train begins its return journey. Alana recalls the prank, and, remembering that Kenny loved magic, suspects the magician is the killer. However the magician has disappeared, and is eventually found impaled inside his sword box. | Alana is sequestered in a locked compartment for her safety, but the killer is still aboard, stalking her. The killer enters the compartment but Alana escapes, and is pursued by the killer through the train. In the final scene, the masked killer is revealed to be Kenny who was disguised half the time as the magician's female assistant. Kenny refuses Alana's apology and forces her to kiss him, but the kiss causes Kenny to relive his memories of the prank, driving him deeper into insanity. Carne rushes to the scene and beats down Kenny with a firemans' shovel, causing him to fall out the open door of the baggage car to his presumable death. His body lands in a nearly frozen river and floats away as the train roars off.","m_cast":"Ben Johnson as Carne, Train Conductor | Jamie Lee Curtis as Alana Maxwell | Hart Bochner as Doc Manley | Sandee Currie as Mitchy | Timothy Webber as Mo | Derek MacKinnon as Kenny Hampson | Anthony Sherwood as Jackson | Joy Boushel as Pet | D.D.

The train's engine was renumbered from its original 1293 to 1881, and, along with five passenger cars, painted black with silver stripes. Afterward, the Steamtown Foundation reverted the engine back to its original number and had it restored to a historic color and lettering scheme. As of July, 2014, Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1293 continues to be an \"operable locomotive.\" [3] It currently resides in the private \"Age of Steam Roundhouse\" near Sugarcreek, Ohio. 1293 can be seen from time to time making runs to the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railway in northeastern Ohio. Built in June 1948, in Kingston, Ontario, the 12-wheeled (4-6-2) steam engine was one of the most advanced in the late stages of the steam-locomotive age. 1293 is the only operational G-5 Pacific model still in running condition of the half dozen still in existence. 1293 now bears the registered name of the Central Ohio Railroad, the operational arm of the \"Age of Steam Roundhouse\". | Terror Train was filmed in and around Montreal, Quebec, Canada from November 21 to December 23, 1979. It was the first motion picture directed by Spottiswoode, who would go on to make such films as Turner & Hooch (1989), Air America (1990), and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). | Cinematographer John Alcott devised a unique method of lighting Terror Train. He rewired the entire train and mounted individual dimmers on the exteriors of the carriage cars. Utilizing a variety of bulbs with different wattages, and controlling them with the external dimmers, Alcott could light the set in a very fast, efficient manner. At times, Alcott also used medical lights - \"pen torches\" - to hand light the actors' faces.[4] | Taking a cue from director John Ford, veteran actor Ben Johnson originally asked director Spottiswoode to give his character Carne less dialogue in Terror Train, rather than more.[4] | There was no stage show magician in the original script, but Canadian producer Sandy Howard was a big fan of magic and admirer of David Copperfield, and a magician character was written in. Copperfield's character becomes the suspect at one point of the movie, but it turns out to be a red herring when the real killer is revealed to be Kenny Hampson. There is some confusion about David Copperfield's character's name. Twice, in the movie the Conductor calls out to him as \"Ken\", but this is when it is believed by he and the passengers that he is Kenny Sampson, the murderer. In the credits, he is simply listed as \"The Magician\".[citation needed] | Canadian actor Derek MacKinnon, who played the masked killer, appears in 11 scenes in Terror Train, wearing a different costume or masked disguise in each scene, including his real character of Kenny.[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Roger Spottiswoode","m_produced_by":"Harold Greenberg","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ben Johnson Jamie Lee Curtis Hart Bochner","m_music_by":"John Mills-Cockell","m_cinematography":"John Alcott","m_edited_by":"Anne Henderson","m_production_company":"Astral Bellevue Pathé Sandy Howard Productions Triple T Productions","m_distributed_by":"Astral Films (Canada) 20th Century Fox (US)","m_release_dates":"October 3, 1980","m_running_time":"97 minutes","m_country":"Canada United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$4.2 million[1]","m_box_office":"$8,000,000[2] | Terror Train is a 1980 Canadian-American horror film directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Ben Johnson.
