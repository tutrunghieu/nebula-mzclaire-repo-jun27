{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A couple checks into a suite in Las Vegas. In flashbacks we see that he's a computer whiz on the verge of becoming a dot.com millionaire (Peter Sarsgaard), she's a lap dancer at a club (Molly Parker). He's depressed, withdrawing from work, missing meetings with investors. He wants a connection, so he offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in Vegas, and she accepts with conditions: four hours per night of erotic play, and no penetration. During the days in Vegas, they get to know each other, have fun, meet a friend of hers, casino dealer Jerri (Carla Gugino); at night, at least after the first night, things seem to get complicated. When the three days are over, the stripper makes it clear that she was only there for the money and that the man she spent the time with was just a client. Upset that the feelings he had weren't mutual he then rapes her, which she makes no attempt to stop. She then masturbates for him to achieve orgasm. The next day he returns home heartbroken. The movie ends with his return to the strip club to see the woman he fell in love with again. She greets him fondly and says that she is glad to see him again. Because the movie is shown in a non-linear format, it is left to the viewer's interpretation of when this event occurred.","m_cast":"Internet executive Jason Calacanis consulted on, and appeared in, the film.","m_reception":"The film opened to mixed reviews, and has been compared to movies with similar \"hooker in love\" storylines such as Exotica and Pretty Woman. The Center of the World is more explicit than those films, containing both female and male full frontal nudity, as well as a penetration shot of a lollipop in a vagina. | The film's title may be an allusion to Courbet's L'Origine du monde.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Wayne Wang","m_produced_by":"Wayne Wang Peter Newman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Sarsgaard Molly Parker","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Mauro Fiore","m_edited_by":"Lee Percy","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"April 19, 2001 (2001-04-19) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"88 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Center of the World is an American film directed by Wayne Wang, which was digitally shot and released in 2001.
