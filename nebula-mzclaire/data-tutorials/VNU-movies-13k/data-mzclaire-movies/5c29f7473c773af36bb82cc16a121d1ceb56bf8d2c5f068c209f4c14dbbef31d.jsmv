{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"500 years after Sun Wukong's (Aaron Kwok) imprisonment under the Five Fingers Mountain, a young Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang (Feng Shaofeng) is sent on a journey to India to collect Buddha's scriptures. On his travels he accidentally frees Wukong and the Monkey King learns from the Mercy Goddess (Kelly Chen) that he has to protect the monk throughout the journey. They also meet Zhu Baije (Xiaoshenyang), a lustful pig demon, and Sha Wujing (Him Law), a djinn-like monk. All three demons accept Sanzang as their Master. | The company travel to the Yun Hai Xi Kingdom, a land terrorized by the White Bone Demon (Gong Li) who snatches children. As the demoness learns about Sanzang, she decides to eat him in order to stop her reincarnation cycle and achieve everlasting demon-hood. She transforms into an old woman and beguiles the group into her cottage in the woods. While her minions lure the three demons into the forest, the demoness tells Sanzang a story about how she was forced to marry as a young girl, and when her village suffered with famine, the people blamed her for it, even calling her an evil demon, and wanted to sacrifice her to the gods. As Sanzang comforts the old lady, she attempts to kill him, but is stopped by Wukong who had seen through her disguise with his Fiery Eyes. He kills the old lady and the demoness escapes. Sanzang and the others don't believe Wukong that all the women he murdered were demons, and blame him for killing the innocent. | The group arrives to the kingdom's capital and the King (Fei Xiang) throws a feast for them, begging Sanzang to exorcise the bloodthirsty demoness. Suddenly the Lady White appears and demands the monk, but he expresses his desire to enlighten her. She tries to persuade Wukong to let her eat the monk, but he deceives her instead, and a fight ensues. During the chaos, the King's guards kidnap Sanzang, but before the King kills him in order to cure himself of a disease - as he has been actually kidnapping all the children and blaming the White Bone Demon - Wukong saves him and the children as well. All of the group are celebrated as heroes, but as a little girl approaches Sanzang, Wukong kills her and her mother as well, seeing the demoness possessing them. That angers Sanzang, and, accusing him of seeing demons everywhere, banishes Wukong away. Wukong leaves, but as soon as he does, the White Demon kidnaps Sanzang. | Baije and Wujing decide to disband, Baije heading to the Flower-Fruit Mountain to beg Wukong for help, and Wujing rushing to the demoness' lair. Baije arrives at the mountain, but Wukong's not there. In her lair, the demoness confesses to the monk that the story she had told him earlier was true, recounting her previous life. Sanzang gets to understand why she doesn't want to become human again, and gives up. Outside the cave, Wujing fights the Lady White's skeleton army, and later is joined by Baije and Wukong, who saves Sanzang. After a hard battle, the White Bone Demon is defeated by the Monkey King. However, Sanzang pleads Buddha to save her soul, only to be told he would have to give up his own life in order to do so. Sanzang accepts, telling the demoness he will do anything to help her, but she refuses, rather destroying herself. Saddened, the monk pleads Wukong to kill him, which he refuses to do. He tells the Monkey King he desires to help the demoness change her doom, no matter how many lives it will take to accomplish. Wukong tearfully agrees, promising to wait for his return forever, and kills him. Because of Sanzang's sacrifice, the demoness is led to her reincarnation to human, finally free of her pain and hatred. | Some time later, Wukong and his friends still wait for the return of the monk, but continue their journey to the Thunder Monastery. It seems that Sanzang actually reenters life, as a human finger cracks through the Buddha statue Wukong is carrying with him.","m_cast":"Aaron Kwok as Sun Wukong, the Monkey King | Gong Li as Baigujing, the White Bone Demon | Feng Shaofeng as Tang Sanzang the Buddhist monk | Xiaoshenyang as Zhu Bajie the pig demon | Him Law as Sha Wujing the water-buffalo | Fei Xiang as the king of Yun Hai Xi Kingdom (literally Western Kingdom of Sea of Clouds) | Kelly Chen as Guan Yin, the Mercy Goddess | Lu Weu, Xi'er Qi and Miya Muqi as the evil spirits snake, bat and pig.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Filmko Entertainment first announced a sequel for The Monkey King on 13 February 2014.
