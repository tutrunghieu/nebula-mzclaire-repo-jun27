{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film starts with the kidnapping of three nuclear scientists by Pralayanath Gendaswami (Deepak Shirke) as he plans to build nuclear missiles for an invasion on India. Meanwhile, Deputy Inspector General of Police Rudrapratap Chauhan (Suresh Oberoi) an honest police officer is murdered by Pralayanath Gendaswami since he has been on his hitlist. Rudrapatap's son Harish (Harish Kumar) is the only witness of his murder. When scientists are gone missing, police calls Brigadier Suryadev Singh (Raaj Kumar) to take matter into his hands. Suryadev allies with hot-headed Police Inspector Shivajirao Waghle (Nana Patekar) who spends a lot of time being suspended due to his temper. When Central Minister Jeevanlal Tandel who is an ally of Pralayanath Gendaswami sets up a meeting with him to inform him about Suryadev Singh, Pralayanath Gendaswami questions why is there information about his glory and not a single photograph of his face. At that moment Suryadev Singh enters the auditorium and reveals that he is the one whose face Pralayanath Gendaswami was so eager to see. | Meanwhile, on the New Year's Eve Harish and his friends witness an attempt of murder on Radha Tandel. They rushes her to hospital but later on flees as the staff calls police to inquire about the case. Police then trace Harish by his wallet which was left at hospital and charge him with an attempt of rape on Radha. | After knowing who Suryadev is, Pralayanath Gendaswami tries to kill him by planting bomb in his car. But Suryadev's car is a high tech vehicle and hence he makes an escape with his driver/bodyguard Bahadur from a below passage door in car. Then the news is widespread that he has been murdered. | But Suryadev escapes and tells this news to Pralayanath through a TV interview. Pralayanath tries to kidnap Professor Khurana but Suryadev and Waghle fail his attempt. Then Pralayanth tries to kill Harish and his friends, but one of his friend sacrifices his life to save him on the eve of Raksha Bandhan. Pralayanath then again tries to kidnap Professor Khurana but fails to do so, and instead takes the fuse conductor to make his missiles work. Waghle and Suryadev track him down through their trans-meter. Suryadev foils Pralayanath's missiles by taking out the fuse conductors and guns him down. Waghle finishes off Pralayanath's son. The film ends with the 15 August programme concluding successfully.","m_cast":"Raaj Kumar as Brigadier Suryadev Singh,A soldier who is very trustworthy who can do anything from repairing cars to flying in space | Nana Patekar as Inspector Shivajirao Waghle, An honest policeman | Suresh Oberoi as DIG Rudrapratap Chauhan, IPS | Alok Nath as Home Minister | Harish Kumar as Harish | Sudhir Dalvi as Prof. Nasrul Hassan, Scientist | Mamta Kulkarni as Harish's fiancee | Rakesh Bedi as Khabrilal | Pankaj Berry | Vishal Mohite as Special Appearance | Varsha Usgaonkar as Shanti | Manohar Singh as Central Minister Jeevanlal Tandel | Deepak Shirke as Pralayanath Gendaswami | Aparajita as Mrs. Gupta | Satyen Kappu as Dr. Gupta | Sujit Kumar as DSP Satyavadi Mishra, IPS | Arjun as Rasiknath Gendaswami | Mahavir Shah as Jailer | Vikas Anand as Judge | Anil Yadav as Babban","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mehul Kumar","m_produced_by":"Mehul Kumar","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Raaj Kumar Nana Patekar Mamta Kulkarni Varsha Usgaonkar Deepak Shirke Manohar Singh","m_music_by":"Laxmikant-Pyarelal Santosh Anand (lyrics)","m_cinematography":"Russi Billimoria","m_edited_by":"Yusuf Sheikh","m_production_company":"M.
