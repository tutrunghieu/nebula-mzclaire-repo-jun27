{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the late 1990s, writer Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) has settled in a lakeside New England cabin following his second divorce and a battle with prostate cancer. His quiet life is interrupted by Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), a former dean and professor of classics at local Athena College, who was forced to resign after being accused of making a racist remark in class. Coleman's wife died suddenly following the scandal, and he wants to avenge his loss of career and companion by writing a book about the events with Nathan's assistance. | The project is placed on the back burner when Coleman has an affair with Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), a considerably younger, semi-literate woman who supports herself by working menial jobs, including at the college. Their relationship is threatened by the faculty members who forced Coleman from his job and by Faunia's stalker ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris), a mentally unbalanced Vietnam War veteran who blames her for the deaths of their children in an accident. Flashbacks of Coleman's life reveal to the audience his secretâ€”he is an African American who has passed as a white Jewish man for most of his adult life.","m_cast":"Anthony Hopkins as Coleman Silk | Nicole Kidman as Faunia Farley | Gary Sinise as Nathan Zuckerman | Ed Harris as Lester Farley | Wentworth Miller as Young Coleman Silk | Jacinda Barrett as Steena Paulsson | Mimi Kuzyk as Delphine Roux | Clark Gregg as Nelson Primus | Anna Deavere Smith as Dorothy Silk | Phyllis Newman as Iris Silk | Mili Avital as Young Iris | Harry Lennix as Clarence Silk | Tom Rack as Bob Cat | Lizan Mitchell as Ernestine Silk | Danny Blanco-Hall as Walter Silk","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Human Stain by Philip Roth","m_directed_by":"Robert Benton","m_produced_by":"Tom Rosenberg Gary Lucchesi Scott Steindorff Bob Weinstein Harvey Weinstein","m_screenplay_by":"Nicholas Meyer","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Anthony Hopkins Nicole Kidman Gary Sinise","m_music_by":"Rachel Portman","m_cinematography":"Jean-Yves Escoffier","m_edited_by":"Christopher Tellefsen","m_production_company":"Lakeshore Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Miramax Films","m_release_dates":"October 31, 2003","m_running_time":"106 minutes","m_country":"United States Germany France","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$30 million","m_box_office":"$24,863,804 | The Human Stain is a 2003 American drama film directed by Robert Benton.
