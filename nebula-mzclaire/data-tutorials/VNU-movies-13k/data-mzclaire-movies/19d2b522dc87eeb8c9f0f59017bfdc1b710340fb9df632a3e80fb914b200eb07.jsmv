{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A convicted car thief and diehard Chicago Cubs fan, Jimmy Dworski (Belushi) wins tickets to the World Series. Unfortunately, he still has a couple of days left to serve in prison and the warden (Héctor Elizondo) won't let him leave and come back. With the help of other inmates, Jimmy stages a riot so he can sneak out of prison to see the game. On the way, he finds the filofax of uptight and spineless yuppie advertising executive Spencer Barnes (Grodin), which promises a reward if it is found. | Over the next day, Jimmy takes on Barnes' identity —- staying in the Malibu beach house of Spencer's boss, flirting with the boss's daughter, even taking a meeting with a powerful Japanese food company magnate named Sakamoto (Mako Iwamatsu). The fake \"Spencer\"'s unorthodox methods, such as beating the magnate at tennis and telling him about the poor quality of his food products, gets the attention of the taken aback Sakamoto. However his unconventional negotiations with the food company insults some of the executives, seemingly ruining Spencer's reputation. Meanwhile, lacking his precious filofax, the real Spencer Barnes is spiraling into the gutter. Losing all his clothes, his car and money, he has to rely on an old college acquaintance, the neurotic and overbearing Debbie Lipton (Anne De Salvo) who keeps trying to rekindle a relationship with him. | Finally Jimmy and Spencer come together at a meeting with the advertising executives, where Spencer is sacked by his boss. As a consolation Jimmy takes Spencer to the World Series, where Jimmy makes a spectacular catch on a home-run ball hit by Mark Grace, who makes a cameo. When security goes after Jimmy, who was spotted on the Jumbotron, they escape by using Spencer's filofax to slide down a support wire and out of the stadium. Spencer patches up his marriage with his wife, who had become exasperated with his overworking. Jimmy sneaks back into prison with Spencer's help, serves his last couple of hours and is released, only to find Spencer waiting to pick him up. With the promise of a beautiful girlfriend and a well-paying job in advertising working with Spencer, Jimmy's future looks bright, as does that of his beloved Cubs, who won the World Series.","m_cast":"James Belushi as Jimmy Dworski | Charles Grodin as Spencer Barnes | Mako as Mr. Sakamoto | Héctor Elizondo as the Warden | Veronica Hamel as Elizabeth Barnes | Stephen Elliott as Walter Bentley | Loryn Locklin as Jewel Bentley | John de Lancie as Ted Bradford Jr. | Gates McFadden as Diane Connors | Anne De Salvo as Debbie Lipton | Burke Byrnes as Prison Guard","m_reception":"The film gained negative reviews.[1]","m_production":"Baseball scenes for Taking Care of Business were filmed at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in California. | The film grossed $20 million in the USA.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Arthur Hiller","m_produced_by":"Geoffrey Taylor","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"James Belushi | Charles Grodin | Anne De Salvo | Mako | Veronica Hamel | Héctor Elizondo","m_music_by":"Stewart Copeland","m_cinematography":"David M.
