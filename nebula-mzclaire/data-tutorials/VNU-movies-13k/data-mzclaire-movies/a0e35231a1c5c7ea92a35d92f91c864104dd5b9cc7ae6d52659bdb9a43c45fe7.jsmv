{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs-fueled stockbroker culture and teaches him that a stockbroker's only job is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune. | Jordan befriends his apartment neighbor Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), and the two found their own company. They recruit Jordan's accountant parents as well as several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\". The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable name of \"Stratton Oakmont\". After an exposé in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. | Jordan becomes immensely successful, and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie). When his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti) finds out, they divorce and he marries Naomi, soon having a daughter, Skylar. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. | Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden (Jake Hoffman). This brings him and his firm to the attention of the FBI, mainly agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). To hide his illegitimate money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel (Jean Dujardin) in the name of Naomi's aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), who is a British citizen and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal), who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland. | Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Jordan also learns from his private investigator (Bo Dietl) that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father (Rob Reiner) advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer (Jon Favreau) negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit, and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. | Jordan, Donnie and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. In order to bypass border controls, he forces his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, and the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this a sign from God and decides to sober up. | Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. | Fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Jordan loses his mind and tries to run off with Skylar in his car, but ends up crashing it in the driveway. | The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work. Jordan slips Donnie a note warning him about the wire. The FBI discovers the note, and Jordan is arrested for breaching his cooperation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. | Despite this one breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves 3 years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Wolf of Wall Street received generally positive reviews, with many praising DiCaprio and Hill's performances, Scorsese's direction, and Winter's screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 77% approval rating, based on 248 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's consensus states: \"Funny, self-referential, and irreverent to a fault, The Wolf of Wall Street finds Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their most infectiously dynamic.\"[84] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[85] | Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine named The Wolf of Wall Street as the third best film of 2013, behind 12 Years a Slave and Gravity at numbers one and two, respectively. The movie was chosen as one of the top ten films of the year by the American Film Institute.[86] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said \"it is the best and most enjoyable American film to be released this year.\"[87] The Chicago Sun-Times's Richard Roeper gave the film a \"B+\" score, saying the film was \"good, not great Scorsese\".[88] | Dana Stevens, a member of the New York Film Critics Circle, wrote that the movie did not work for her after labeling the film \"Epic in size, claustrophobically narrow in scope.\"[89] According to Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post the story \"wants us to be interested in characters who are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions of being interesting because they are high.\"[90] Some critics viewed the movie as an irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown. DiCaprio responded that in his opinion the film does not glorify the excessive lifestyle it depicts.[91][92] | The Wolf of Wall Street was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[93] | The film received a \"C\" rating from audiences surveyed by CinemaScore,[95] a rating lower than anything else in theaters the opening week of the film.[96] The Los Angeles Times argues that the film attracted conservative viewers by depicting a more moral tone in its marketing than the film itself depicted.[97] | Christina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis, who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont, wrote an open letter addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticizing the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.[98] | Steven Perlberg of Business Insider saw an advance screening of the film at a Regal Cinemas near the Goldman Sachs building, with an audience of financial workers. Perlberg reported cheers from the audience at all the wrong moments—\"When Belfort — a drug addict attempting to remain sober — rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers.\"[99][96] | The former Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted the real Belfort criticized both the movie and the book on which it is based. He said he believes some of Belfort's claims were \"invented\", as for instance \"[Belfort] aggrandized his importance and reverence for him by others at his firm.\" He strongly criticizes the film for not depicting the \"thousands of [scam] victims who lost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" not accepting the filmmakers' argument in which that would detract attention from the wrongdoers. Furthermore, he deplores the ending—\"beyond an insult\" to his victims—in which the real Belfort appears, while showing \"a large sign advertising the name of Mr. Belfort's real motivational speaking company,\" and a positive depiction of Belfort uttering \"variants of the same falsehoods he trained others to use against his victims.\"[100] |  | The film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese, Best Adapted Screenplay for Winter, Best Actor for DiCaprio, and Best Supporting Actor for Hill. It was also nominated for four BAFTAs, including Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay, and two Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. DiCaprio won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.","m_production":"In 2007, Leonardo DiCaprio/Warner Bros. won a bidding war against Brad Pitt/Paramount Pictures for the rights to Jordan Belfort's memoir The Wolf of Wall Street, and Martin Scorsese was considered to direct the film.[29][30] During pre-production, Scorsese worked on the film's script before working on Shutter Island. He describes having \"wasted five months of [his] life\" without getting a green light on production dates by the Warner Brothers studio.[31] Jordan Belfort made $1 million on the movie rights.[32] | In 2010, Warner Bros. had offered Ridley Scott to direct the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the male lead,[33] but the studio eventually dumped the project.[34] | In 2012, a green light was given by the independent company Red Granite Pictures allowing no restrictions to the content development. Scorsese knew that there were no limits to the content that he would produce and therefore came back on board, resulting in an R rating.[35] Red Granite Pictures also asked Paramount Pictures to distribute the film;[36] Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film in North America and Japan, but passed on the rest of the international market.[37] | In the film, most of the real-life characters' names have been changed from Belfort's original memoir. Donnie Azoff is based on Danny Porush. The name was changed after Porush threatened to sue the filmmakers. Porush maintains that much of the film was fictional and that Donny Azoff was not in fact an accurate depiction of him.[9][10][38] The FBI agent known as Patrick Denham is the stand-in for real-life Gregory Coleman,[39] and lawyer Manny Riskin is based on Ira Sorkin.[40] Belfort's first wife Denise Lombardo is renamed Teresa Petrillo, while second wife Nadine Caridi became Naomi Lapaglia on-screen. In contrast, Mark Hanna's name remains the same as the LF Rothschild stockbroker who, like Belfort, was convicted of fraud and served time in prison.[41][42] Belfort's parents Max and Leah Belfort's names remained the same for the film.[43] The role of Aunt Emma was initially offered to Julie Andrews, who refused it as she was recovering from an ankle injury, and she was replaced by Joanna Lumley.[44] | In January 2014, Jonah Hill revealed in an interview with Howard Stern that he made only $60,000 on the film (the lowest possible SAG-AFTRA rate for his amount of work), while his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio (who also produced) received $10 million. Hill didn't care about his settlement though, and wanted to play Donnie Azoff so badly that he was willing to do whatever it took to get the part as it was his dream to be in a Scorsese film.[45][46][47][48] | Filming began on August 8, 2012 in New York.[49] Jonah Hill announced that his first day of shooting was September 4, 2012.[50] Filming also took place in Closter, New Jersey[51] and Harrison, New York. In January 2013, additional scenes were shot at a set built in an abandoned office building in Ardsley, New York. Scenes at the beach house were filmed in Sands Point, New York.[52] | Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker stated that the film would be shot digitally instead of on film.[53] Scorsese had been a proponent of shooting on film but decided to shoot Hugo digitally because it was being photographed in 3D; however, The Wolf of Wall Street was originally planned to be shot digitally despite being filmed in 2D.[54] Schoonmaker expressed her disappointment with the decision: \"It would appear that we've lost the battle. I think Marty just feels it's unfortunately over, and there's been no bigger champion of film than him.\"[53] After extensive comparison tests during pre-production, eventually the majority of the film was shot on film stock while scenes that used green screen effects or low light were shot with the digital Arri Alexa.[54] The film contains 400–450 VFX shots.[55] | The Wolf of Wall Street uses animals including a chimpanzee, a lion, a snake, a fish, and dogs.[56] The chimpanzee and the lion were provided by the Big Cat Habitat wildlife sanctuary in Sarasota County, Florida. The four-year-old chimpanzee Chance spent time with actor Leonardo DiCaprio and learned to roller skate over the course of three weeks. The sanctuary also provided a lion named Handsome because the film's trading company used a lion for its symbol.[57] Danny Porush was Jordan Belfort's real-life partner, and he denied there being any animals in the office.[58] | In December 2013, before the film's premiere, the organization Friends of Animals criticized the use of the chimpanzee and organized a boycott of the film. Variety reported, \"Friends of Animals thinks the chimp ... suffered irreversible psychological damage after being forced to act.\"[59] The Guardian said, \"Criticism of The Wolf of Wall Street's use of a chimpanzee arrives as Hollywood comes under ever-increasing scrutiny for its employment of animals on screen,\" referring to a November 2013 report in The Hollywood Reporter that was critical of the American Humane Association's treatment of animals in films.[58] PETA also launched a campaign to highlight mistreatment of ape \"actors\" and to petition for DiCaprio not to work with great apes.[60]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Wolf of Wall Street  by Jordan Belfort","m_directed_by":"Martin Scorsese","m_produced_by":"Martin Scorsese | Leonardo DiCaprio | Riza Aziz | Joey McFarland | Emma Tillinger Koskoff","m_screenplay_by":"Terence Winter","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Leonardo DiCaprio | Jonah Hill | Margot Robbie | Matthew McConaughey | Kyle Chandler | Rob Reiner | Jon Bernthal | Jon Favreau | Jean Dujardin","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Rodrigo Prieto","m_edited_by":"Thelma Schoonmaker","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures (United States) Universal Pictures (International)","m_release_dates":"December 17, 2013 (2013-12-17) (New York City premiere) | December 25, 2013 (2013-12-25) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"179 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$155 million[2][3][4]","m_box_office":"$392 million[3] | The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. The screenplay by Terence Winter is adapted from the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort and recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm Stratton Oakmont engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street that ultimately led to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Belfort (and also co-produced the film), with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who tries to bring him down. Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, and Jean Dujardin are also featured. The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), and Shutter Island (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series Boardwalk Empire (2010–14). | The Wolf of Wall Street premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and it was released theatrically on December 25, 2013 in the United States, distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was the first to be released entirely through digital distribution. It was a major commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide during its original theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing movie to date and the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013.[5] The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, profanity, depiction of hard drug use, and the use of animals during production. The film also caused controversy due to the funding of 1MDB from Malaysia.[6] | The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for Scorsese's direction and the comedic performances of DiCaprio and Hill, and was nominated for several awards including five nominations at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese, Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) for Winter, and Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations for DiCaprio and Hill, respectively. The film did not win in any category, although DiCaprio did win Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. It was also recognized by numerous other awards ceremonies, as well as guilds and critics' associations. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (18)\".
