{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story is set in the fictional Caribbean island and British colony of Cascara. Widely ignored by the British Government, media, and general public, local Governor Baxter Thwaites is having an easy life in his small and peaceful colony. That peace is disturbed when an abandoned oil rig starts delivering water - at the standard of the finest table water brands (and laxative companies, as it contains a substance that makes you \"shit like clockwork\"). Different parties, including Downing Street, the Cascara Liberation Front, the White House, French bottled water producers, and the Cubans take interest in the future of the island and threaten to destroy the cosy way of life enjoyed by the island's inhabitants.","m_cast":"Michael Caine as Governor Baxter Thwaites | Valerie Perrine as Pamela Weintraub | Brenda Vaccaro as Dolores Thwaites | Leonard Rossiter as Sir Malcolm Leveridge | Billy Connolly as Delgado Fitzhugh | Chris Tummings as Garfield Cooper | Dennis Dugan as Rob Waring | Fulton Mackay as Reverend Eric McNab | Jimmie Walker as Jay Jay | Dick Shawn as Deke Halliday | Fred Gwynne as Franklin Spender | Trevor Laird as Pepito | Alan Igbon as Cuban | Maureen Lipman as Margaret Thatcher","m_reception":"The film received a mixed review in the New York Times, which read in part \"The folks who packaged this put-on operated on the theory that a lot of eccentric people doing nutty things produce hilarity. The ingredient missing from the fitfully amusing conglomeration of characters is a character for the whole. In kidding everything, the movie leaves us uncertain about whether anything is being seriously kidded.\"[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Dick Clement","m_produced_by":"George Harrison Ian La Frenais Denis O'Brien","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Caine | Valerie Perrine | Brenda Vaccaro | Leonard Rossiter | Billy Connolly | Eric Clapton | George Harrison | Ringo Starr","m_music_by":"Mike Moran Eric Clapton Eddy Grant George Harrison","m_cinematography":"Douglas Slocombe","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":"HandMade Films","m_distributed_by":"Atlantic Releasing","m_release_dates":"1985","m_running_time":"115 min.","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | Water is a 1985 British comedy film scripted by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, directed by Clement, and starring Michael Caine.
