{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Xi and his San tribe (of !Kung bushmen[4]) are \"living well off the land\" in the Kalahari Desert. They are happy because of their belief that the gods have provided plenty of everything, and no one among them has any wants. One day, a glass Coca-Cola bottle is thrown out of an airplane and falls to Earth unbroken. Initially, Xi's people suppose this strange artifact is another \"present\" from the gods and find many uses for it. (They employ it as a crafts tool, blow the top to make music, etc.) But unlike anything that they have had before, there is only one glass bottle to go around. With everyone wanting it at once, they soon find themselves experiencing envy, anger, and even violence. | Since the bottle has caused the tribe unhappiness, Xi consults with elders and concludes that it's an \"evil thing\" which the gods were \"absent-minded\" to send them. Noting that some attempts to dispose of the bottle have failed, Xi agrees to make a pilgrimage to the edge of the world and toss the seemingly cursed thing off. | Along the way, he encounters a diverse assortment of people. There's biologist Andrew Steyn, who is studying the local animals; Kate Thompson, the newly hired village school teacher; a band of guerrillas led by Sam Boga, who are being pursued by government troops after an unsuccessful attack; a safari tour guide named Jack Hind; and Steyn's assistant and mechanic, M'pudi (who is maintaining his cantankerous Land Rover). | When hungry Xi happens upon a corral, he shoots a goat with a tranquilizer arrow. He is shortly jailed for this attempt on livestock. M'pudi, who once lived with the San and still speaks Xi's dialect, concludes that Xi will die if kept incarcerated. He and Steyn apply to employ Xi as a tracker for the remainder of his sentence in lieu of prison. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade Kate's school and take her and the students as human shields for their escape to the neighboring country. | Steyn, M'pudi, and Xi soon discover their field work (observing the local wildlife) is on the terrorists' chosen path. They manage to immobilize the guerrillas as they are passing by and save Kate and the children. But Jack Hind takes away Kate, and Steyn is left at the same place again. | With Xi's term over, Steyn insists upon paying his wages and sending him on his way. Steyn tells Kate about his problem and Kate is impressed and Steyn begins a relationship with Kate despite his acute clumsiness around women. | Xi eventually finds himself at God's Window, the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. This convinces Xi that he has reached the edge of the world, and he throws the bottle off the cliff. Xi then returns to his tribe and receives a warm welcome from his family.","m_cast":"Nǃxau ǂToma as Xi | Marius Weyers as Andrew Steyn | Sandra Prinsloo as Kate Thompson | Michael Thys as M'Pudi (voiced by Pip Freedman) | Louw Verwey as Sam Boga","m_reception":"Based on 19 reviews, The Gods Must Be Crazy has carried a 95% \"Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes.[7] Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, and said in his conclusion: \"It might be easy to make a farce about screwball happenings in the desert, but it's a lot harder to create a funny interaction between nature and human nature.
