{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles to visit with old friend and fellow actor Seth Rogen, who invites him to attend a housewarming party hosted by James Franco. Baruchel is uncomfortable being around so many people he hardly knows, so Rogen accompanies him to a convenience store for cigarettes. | At the store, beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky. Rogen and Baruchel flee back to Franco's house amid mass chaos, but find the party undisturbed. Moments later, an earthquake strikes, and the partygoers rush outside. A large hole opens in Franco's yard, swallowing several partygoers, while Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Jonah Hill, and Craig Robinson survive, and run back inside the house. They take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, and await help. | The next morning, Danny McBride wakes up first. Unaware of the crisis, he wastes much of their food. The others tell him of the previous night's events, which he initially doesn't believe until an outsider is decapitated in front of them. Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Baruchel and Rogen's growing estrangement, and the others' skepticism of Baruchel's belief that the disaster might be the Apocalypse predicted in the Book of Revelation. | Later, Emma Watson, another survivor of the party, returns. However, due to a misunderstanding, she believes the group is planning to rape her and leaves, taking the group's remaining drinks with her. Robinson is chosen to travel outside to the basement for water, but finds the door is locked and returns after an encounter with an unknown being. | Robinson's experience causes him to believe Baruchel's theory that the Apocalypse has arrived. The guys reach the basement by digging through the floor, and find the water, but McBride ends up wasting most of it out of spite. The group unanimously decides to kick McBride out of the house. Franco gives him the revolver, which McBride tries to use to kill the others, only to find that Franco had filled it with blanks. Before he leaves, McBride reveals that Baruchel was in town two months prior but stayed at a hotel, instead of at Rogen's house, because of their strained friendship. Jonah makes a remark that annoys Jay, causing him to punch Jonah. Later that night, Hill prays for Baruchel to die, but is raped by a demon shortly after. | The next day, Robinson and Baruchel go to a neighboring home for supplies. Meanwhile, Franco and Rogen find Hill unconscious from what looks like an LBS episode, but he wakes up possessed. Hill chases Franco and Rogen while Robinson and Baruchel flee a demonic bull at the neighbor's house. The group subdues Hill, but during an exorcism attempt, Baruchel and Rogen get into a fight and knock a candle over. A fire starts, engulfing Hill and the house in flames and forcing the remaining four outside. | Franco suggests taking his car to his home in Malibu, but finds the car guarded by a winged demon. Robinson volunteers to sacrifice himself. The plan succeeds and Robinson is raptured, leading the others to realize they can still be saved if they do a selfless act. As the others escape, the car is hit by an armored motor home filled with cannibals led by Danny McBride, along with Channing Tatum as his pet, and they are captured. Franco volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others, but taunts McBride as he ascends to Heaven, causing his light beam to vanish. Franco is eaten by McBride and his cannibals as Rogen and Baruchel escape. They encounter a gigantic satanic being and, Baruchel apologizes to Seth for his actions. As they await their fate in an embrace, a blue beam strikes Baruchel, and he begins to ascend while Rogen does not. Baruchel grabs Rogen's hand, but Rogen's presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven, so Rogen lets go to save his friend. As he falls into the devil's mouth, he is saved by another beam, which splits the evil being down the middle. | In Heaven, Robinson, who is now an angel, tells them that Heaven is a place where any desire comes true. Baruchel wishes for the Backstreet Boys and the band performs \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" as everyone dances.","m_cast":"Most of the film's cast portray fictional, exaggerated versions of themselves:[4]","m_reception":"Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 83%, based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Energetic, self-deprecating performances and enough guffaw-inducing humor make up for the flaws in This Is the End's loosely written script.\"[22] On Metacritic, the film has an average rating of 67 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[23] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[24] | Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a letter grade of \"A\", saying, \"You could sit through a year's worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything that's genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But This Is the End (opening June 12) truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest.\"[25] Brian D. Johnson of Maclean's wrote, \"There could be worse ways to experience the apocalypse than with a party of stoned celebrities at James Franco's house. For one thing, his epic art collection can be used to board up the cracking walls against demons and zombies. That's the screwball scenario of This Is the End...The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz parody. But with perfect timing, it also sends up a genre that has recently gone viral at the multiplex: the apoca-blockbuster.\"[26] At the other end of the spectrum, Canada's The Globe and Mail compared the film to the interminable wait for a cancelled bus, giving it one and a half stars out of five. The critic referred to the actors in the film as \"the lazy, the privileged and the mirthless\".[27] | In the United States, the film opened at number 2 in its first weekend with $20,719,162, only behind Man of Steel's $116.6 million. This Is the End grossed $101,470,202 in North America, and $24,571,120 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $126,041,322.[2][28]","m_production":"According to Rogen and Goldberg, \"We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and Busta Rhymes were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the Sony lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth.\"[5] The film is also based on Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse, a short film created by Stone and Goldberg in 2007.[6] | In an interview with The Guardian, Goldberg commented on influences contributing to the film, saying \"[i]f you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of Charlie Kaufman. Seth and I always loved The Larry Sanders Show too. And the popularity of reality television now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real. We thought working with our friends in that situation would be awesome because they're all comedians willing to take stabs at themselves.\"[7] The actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, with only James Franco having no objections to doing what the script wanted him to do.[8] | While set in Los Angeles, principal photography was in New Orleans due to tax rebates that would keep the budget low. Filming rolled from February to early July 2012.[9] Modus FX made 240 visual effects for the film, which include natural disasters, set extensions for the house that serves as a primary location, computer-generated demons, and the Rapture lights that raise people to Heaven.[10] In March 2013, the release date was pushed forward two days to June 12, 2013.[11] After filming wrapped, Rogen and Goldberg were displeased about the ending they had originally shot. They thought of putting Morgan Freeman in Heaven, but the actor declined.[12] Since \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" already played in a scene and the directors wanted to close on an over-the-top note, the directors decided to feature the Backstreet Boys in the scene instead.[13] | During production, the film was titled The Apocalypse,[6] a name later changed to The End of the World.[6][14] The name changed to This Is the End on December 20, 2012, upon the release of its first trailer and poster.[15] This was done at the request of Rogen's Paul co-star Simon Pegg, who wrote to Rogen in concern that The End of the World was too similar a title to his comedy film The World's End, also released in the summer of 2013 and centered around an apocalypse with an ensemble cast. As The World's End was the name of a key location in that film, Pegg worried he could not change the name of his film.[16] | On April 1, 2013, Sony released an April Fools' Day trailer for Pineapple Express 2, which was in fact a teaser trailer for This Is the End.[17] According to Rogen and Goldberg, however, the homemade Pineapple Express 2 film in This Is the End depicts what they envision for the actual sequel.[18]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse  by Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg Jason Stone","m_directed_by":"Seth Rogen | Evan Goldberg","m_produced_by":"Seth Rogen | Evan Goldberg","m_screenplay_by":"Seth Rogen | Evan Goldberg | James Weaver","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"James Franco | Jonah Hill | Seth Rogen | Jay Baruchel | Danny McBride | Craig Robinson | with Michael Cera | and Emma Watson","m_music_by":"Henry Jackman","m_cinematography":"Brandon Trost","m_edited_by":"Zene Baker","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"June 3, 2013 (2013-06-03) (Fox Village Theater) | June 14, 2013 (2013-06-14) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"106 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$32 million[2]","m_box_office":"$126 million[2] | This Is the End is a 2013 American disaster comedy film directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (in their directorial debut) and stars Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Michael Cera and Emma Watson.
