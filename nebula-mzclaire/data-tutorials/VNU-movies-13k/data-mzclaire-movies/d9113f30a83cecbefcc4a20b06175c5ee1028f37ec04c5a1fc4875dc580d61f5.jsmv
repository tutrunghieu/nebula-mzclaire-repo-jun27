The large cast includes both famous actors and unknowns, many of whom Kieślowski also used in his other films. Typically for Kieślowski, the tone of most of the films is melancholic, except for the final one, which, like Three Colors: White, is a black comedy, and features two of the same actors, Jerzy Stuhr and Zbigniew Zamachowski. | The series was conceived when Krzysztof Piesiewicz, who had seen a 15th-century artwork illustrating the Commandments in scenes from that time period, suggested the idea of a modern equivalent. Krzysztof Kieślowski was interested in the philosophical challenge and also wanted to use the series as a portrait of the hardships of Polish society, while deliberately avoiding the political issues he had depicted in earlier films. He originally meant to hire ten different directors, but decided to direct the films himself, though using a different cinematographer for each with exception of episodes III and IX, both of which used Piotr Sobociński as director of photography.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Krzysztof Kieślowski","m_produced_by":"Ryszard Chutkowski","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Artur Barciś see below","m_music_by":"Zbigniew Preisner","m_cinematography":"Wieslaw Zdort Piotr Sobociński","m_edited_by":"Ewa Smal","m_production_company":"Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) Telewizja Polska (TVP)","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.
