{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the early 1950s, Cuban brothers and musicians Cesar (Armand Assante) and Nestor Castillo (Antonio Banderas) flee from Havana, Cuba after getting into a violent dispute with the mobster owners of a club where they performed. Eventually ending up in New York City, the brothers work at menial jobs while attempting to revive their musical careers. At a nightclub where Cesar briefly crashes the act of mambo star Tito Puente, they make new friends and connections, as well as meeting cigarette girl Lanna Lake (Cathy Moriarty), who falls quickly into a love affair with Cesar. | Nestor, in the meantime, remains oblivious to other women while continually composing his ode to his lost Cuban love, Maria (Talisa Soto). He writes version after version of the same ballad, \"Beautiful Maria of My Soul\", until by chance one day he encounters Delores (Maruschka Detmers), a shy but attentive young woman who wishes to become a schoolteacher. When she becomes pregnant, they decide to get married. | Fate intervenes one night at a club, where the Castillo brothers have a part-time job. Nestor's love ballad captures the interest of one of the customers, who turns out to be the Cuban bandleader and American television star Desi Arnaz (played by his son, Desi Arnaz, Jr.). After a pleasant evening in Nestor and Delores's home, Arnaz generously invites the struggling Castillos to sing and act on an episode of his smash sitcom series, I Love Lucy. | Fame does not last, however. Nestor is not as ambitious as his brother and desires nothing more than to own his own small club. He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, suppresses his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor. | There are tragic consequences one snowy night when the Castillo brothers' car veers off the road and into a tree. Cesar, in the back seat of the vehicle, is barely hurt, but Nestor, having driven the car, is killed. The life of Cesar, shattered, is never the same. To honor his brother's memory, Cesar opens his own small club, which is well received. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing Nestor's song for her.","m_cast":"Armand Assante as Cesar Castillo | Antonio Banderas as Nestor Castillo | Cathy Moriarty as Lanna Lake | Maruschka Detmers as Delores Fuentes | Desi Arnaz, Jr. as Desi Arnaz, Sr. | Roscoe Lee Browne as Fernando Perez | Celia Cruz as Evalina Montoya | Vondie Curtis-Hall as Miguel Montoya | Talisa Soto as Maria Rivera | Tito Puente as Himself | Thomas F.

In 1988, Hijuelos sent Glimcher a manuscript of his novel The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love.[3] Glimcher purchased the film rights before the novel was published one year later.[4] He hired Cuban-born screenwriter Cynthia Cidre to write the script.[3] Cidre spent a year and a half working on the screenplay, and after 24 drafts, she had stripped the story down to cover only half of Hijuelos's 407-page book.[3] When asked about the modification of his novel in the film adaptation, Hijuelos said, \"My only concern was that the Cuban culture be treated with respect and the music be authentic and accurate to the period.\"[3] | Various studios rejected the project, until Glimcher persuaded Tom Pollock, chairman of Universal Studios, to financially back the film on a low budget. Before production could begin however, Pollock insisted that footage from the television series I Love Lucy be a key part of the film.[1] Following Lucille Ball's death in 1989, Glimcher was unable to secure the rights to use footage for the film. After Universal cancelled production of The Mambo Kings, the project moved to Warner Bros.; Glimcher met with the studio's president Terry Semel, who introduced him to producer Arnon Milchan, who agreed to co-financed The Mambo Kings with his production company Regency Enterprises and the French-based film studio Le Studio Canal+. The film was given a production budget of $15.5 million.[1] | Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal choices for the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had appeared in a number of films but had not yet broken out as a major star; Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California,[5] hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience.[4] | Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically.[5] Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.[4] | Annabella Sciorra was originally cast as Nestor’s new love interest Delores, a role that eventually went to actress Maruschka Detmers when Sciorra was forced to pull out. Detmers was given the role just two weeks prior to filming. Glimcher cast Cathy Moriarty as Cesar's girlfriend Lanna Lake based on the actress's performance in Raging Bull.[4] | Desi Arnaz, Jr. was chosen to portray his father, Desi Arnaz, in a scene in which the Castillo brothers appear on an episode of I Love Lucy.[4] In preparing for his role, Arnaz, Jr. dyed his hair black and wore an ID bracelet, ring and pin, all of which had belonged to his late father. \"I wasn't trying to look exactly like him,\" he explained. \"It was more about getting his essence and mannerisms.\"[4] In an effort to re-create the mambo world of the 1950s, Glimcher hired musicians Tito Puente and Celia Cruz to appear.[4] | The Mambo Kings was filmed in Los Angeles, California, which was used to create a 1950s-era New York City.[3] The Palladium Ballroom, a long-gone New York City concert hall, was recreated and serves as a centrepiece in the film.[3] In describing the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, \"There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz we looked at, and we got pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the private archives of many people.\"[3] Ann Roth served as costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe.[6] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions.[7] The set of the Ricardos' living room was re-created, with film editors intercutting footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball.\"[4] | Assante and Banderas did their own singing, and studied to master the instruments their characters use in the film.[4] Assante practiced on drums, preparing for a scene in which his character plays a musical number with Tito Puente. Banderas worked to mimic the correct posture and finger placements for his character's trumpet performances, while the actual playing was performed by Arturo Sandoval.[4] | Music supervisor Robert Kraft used existing music from the 1950s, all of which had to be re-recorded, as they were originally recorded in mono sound.[3] The song \"Beautiful Maria of My Soul\" was written for the film by Glimcher, and composed by Kraft. The motion picture soundtrack features a number of original master recordings, re-recorded tracks and mambo music from Arturo Sandoval, Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. The soundtrack was released by Elektra Records.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love by Oscar Hijuelos","m_directed_by":"Arne Glimcher","m_produced_by":"Arnon Milchan Arne Glimcher","m_screenplay_by":"Cynthia Cidre","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Armand Assante | Antonio Banderas | Cathy Moriarty | Maruschka Detmers","m_music_by":"Robert Kraft","m_cinematography":"Michael Ballhaus","m_edited_by":"Claire Simpson","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"February 28, 1992 (1992-02-28) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes","m_country":"United States France","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$15.5 million[1]","m_box_office":"$6.7 million(domestic)[2] | The Mambo Kings is a 1992 French–American drama film directed by Arne Glimcher.
