{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Self-destructive, alcoholic nymphomaniac Marylee (Dorothy Malone) and her insecure, alcoholic playboy brother Kyle (Robert Stack) are the children of Texas oil baron Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Spoiled by their inherited wealth and crippled by their personal demons, neither is able to sustain a personal relationship. | Problems ensue after Kyle's impulsive marriage to New York City executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), who becomes a steadying influence to his life through the first few months after they meet. Kyle resumes drinking after being unsuccessful in fathering a baby. He turns against his childhood friend, Marylee's long-time infatuation, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), a geologist for the oil company. Kyle's anger and depression grow after the death of his father, who admires Mitch but is disgusted with the behavior of his two heirs. | Mitch is secretly in love with Lucy. He keeps these feelings private until Kyle, having been diagnosed with a low sperm count, physically assaults Lucy when she announces her pregnancy, wrongly assuming it to be the result of adultery with Mitch. Lucy's fall results in a miscarriage. Mitch vows to leave town with her as soon as she's well enough to travel. On his return, a drunken Kyle recovers a hidden pistol and intends to shoot Mitch. Marylee struggles with her brother for the weapon, but it accidentally fires, killing him. | Repeatedly spurned by the man she claims to love, a spiteful Marylee threatens to implicate Mitch in Kyle's death. At the inquest, she first testifies that he killed her sibling. But she tearfully redeems herself at the last second by admitting the truth. Mitch and Lucy depart, leaving Marylee to mourn the death of her brother and run the company alone.","m_cast":"Rock Hudson as Mitch Wayne | Lauren Bacall as Lucy Moore Hadley | Robert Stack as Kyle Hadley | Dorothy Malone as Marylee Hadley | Robert Keith as Jasper Hadley | Grant Williams as Biff Miley | Edward Platt as Dr. Paul Cochrane | Robert J.

For this film she dyed her hair platinum blonde in order to shed her \"nice girl\" image in portraying the obsessive Marylee Hadley. Her Oscar-winning performance finally gave her cachet in the film industry. | Sirk and cinematographer Russell Metty worked together six times prior to this film. He helped perfect the light and color effects associated with Sirk's greatest films. | Lauren Bacall, whose film career was foundering, accepted the relatively non-flashy role of Lucy Moore at the behest of her husband Humphrey Bogart. At the same time she was shooting Wind, she was preparing for a television adaptation of Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit, co-starring Coward and Claudette Colbert. In 2005, she accepted the Frontier Award on behalf of the film from the Austin Film Society, which annually makes inductions into the Texas Film Hall of Fame recognizing actors, directors, screenwriters, filmmakers, and films from, influenced by, or inspired by the Lone Star State. | Stack felt the primary reason he lost the Oscar to Anthony Quinn (whose winning performance in Lust for Life was less than ten minutes long) was that 20th Century Fox, which had loaned him to Universal-International, organized block voting against him to prevent one of its contract players from winning an acting award while working at another studio.[2] | The title song, written by Sammy Cahn and Victor Young, was sung by The Four Aces during the opening credits. The film's score was composed by Frank Skinner. | This was the sixth of eight films Douglas Sirk made with Rock Hudson, and the most successful. Sirk reunited key cast members Hudson, Stack and Malone two years later for The Tarnished Angels, his black-and-white epic about early aviators based upon William Faulkner's novel Pylon. | This title was one of the very few \"flat wide screen\" (FWS) titles to be printed \"direct to matrix\" by Technicolor, a process that was usually reserved for Technicolor's \"captive\" processes, including Cinerama, Technirama, Techniscope, Todd-AO, VistaVision and a few other so-called \"wide gauge\" processes, and by which this specially ordered 35mm printing process it was intended to maintain the highest possible print quality, as well as protecting the negative. Other notable examples of such FWS printing by Technicolor includes Giant. Universal must have expected this title to be a blockbuster, as was Giant, released just two months earlier, otherwise it would not have gone to the great expense of ordering \"direct to matrix\" Technicolor prints. | In the case of this title, the Criterion DVD has the motor and changeover cues erased, with the exception of a few reels in which these cues are still intact. These cues are the \"legacy\" Technicolor \"serrated\" kind, generally abandoned after 1955, but without the highlighting usually found thereupon. By the date of this title, most Technicolor cues had been changed to smaller round cues, which accommodated the significantly higher magnification which was required for FWS projection.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Written on the Wind (1945 novel)","m_directed_by":"Douglas Sirk","m_produced_by":"Albert Zugsmith","m_screenplay_by":"George Zuckerman","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Rock Hudson Lauren Bacall Robert Stack Dorothy Malone","m_music_by":"Frank Skinner Victor Young","m_cinematography":"Russell Metty","m_edited_by":"Russell F.
