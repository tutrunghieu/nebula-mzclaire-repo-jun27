{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During World War II, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, young Polish military officer Janusz Wieszczek (Jim Sturgess) is held as a POW and interrogated by the NKVD. The Soviets, unable to get him to say he is a spy, take into custody his wife from whom they extort a statement condemning him. He is sentenced to 20 years in a Gulag labour camp deep in Siberia. | There Janusz meets those with whom he later plans an escape: Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), an American engineer; Khabarov (Mark Strong), an actor; Valka (Colin Farrell), a hardened Russian criminal; Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), a Polish artist; Voss (Gustaf Skarsgård), a Latvian priest; Kazik (Sebastian Urzendowsky), a Pole suffering from night blindness; and Zoran (Dragoş Bucur), a Yugoslavian accountant. Khabarov secretly tells Janusz that he is planning to escape south to Mongolia, passing Lake Baikal. Mr. Smith cautions Janusz that it is Khabarov's way to discuss escape plans with newcomers, to maintain his morale, but nothing will come of it. At times Janusz seems to hallucinate the front door of a country home and adjoining window ledge, which holds plants and a rock he attempts to reach for. Janusz follows through with the escape with Mr. Smith, Valka, Voss, Tomasz, Zoran, and Kazik during a severe snowstorm that covers their tracks. | Kazik freezes to death the second night of the trek, after losing his way back to the campsite while looking for wood, and the group buries him. After many days of travelling across the snows of Siberia, the group reaches Lake Baikal. There they meet Irena (Saoirse Ronan), a young Polish girl, who tells them Russian soldiers murdered her parents sent her to a collective farm near Warsaw, where they treated her cruelly, so she escaped. Mr. Smith realises the inaccuracies in her story, as Warsaw is occupied by the Germans; nevertheless, despite his misgivings that she'll slow them down and tax their meagre food supply, he agrees with the group to let her in. Mr. Smith eventually cautions her about the lie and says he will not tolerate any more, in response to which she admits that her parents were communists but the communist rulers killed them anyway and sent her to an orphanage. | When the group reaches an unpatrolled border between the Soviet Union and Mongolia, Valka, who idolizes Stalin and does not know what he would do elsewhere, decides to stay. The rest continue to Ulan Bator, but soon they see images of Stalin and a red star. Janusz realises that Mongolia is under communist control and tells the group they should take refuge in British India. As they continue south across the Gobi Desert, lack of water, sandstorms, sunburn, blisters, and sunstroke weaken the group. Irena collapses several times and soon dies. A few days later, Tomasz collapses and dies. Mr. Smith is on the verge of death, but after being motivated by Janusz, Zoran, and Voss, he decides to rejoin the group, and the severely dehydrated four find a much-needed water source. | As they reach the Himalayas, all of them on the verge of death, they are rescued by a Tibetan monk who takes them to a Buddhist monastery, where they regain their strength. Mr. Smith decides to go to Lhasa with the help of one of the monk's contacts, who will smuggle him out through China. Once there, he anticipates he will be able to connect with the US military; his return to America ensured. The remaining three continue to trek through the Himalayas and soon reach India. | At the end of the film, Janusz keeps walking around the world until 1989, when Poland ousts the communists. The final scene of the film shows Janusz, 50 years after being taken captive, again envisioning the door and reaching for the rock; this time he takes a key hidden beneath the rock to open the door and reconcile with his wife.","m_cast":"Jim Sturgess as Janusz Wieszczek, a young Polish inmate taken Prisoner of War during the Soviet invasion of Poland | Colin Farrell as Valka, a tough Russian inmate and gambler | Ed Harris as Mr. Smith, an American inmate and former engineer | Saoirse Ronan as Irena Zielińska, an orphaned teenage Polish girl on the run from Soviet Russia, who meets up with the fugitives near Lake Baikal | Mark Strong as Khabarov, an actor | Dragoş Bucur as Zoran, a Yugoslavian inmate who used to be an accountant | Gustaf Skarsgård as Voss, a Latvian inmate and former priest | Alexandru Potocean as Tomasz, an artist and former pastry chef | Sebastian Urzendowsky as Kazik","m_reception":"The Way Back received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 74% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 129 reviews, with an average score of 6.8 out of 10. The critical consensus is: \"It isn't as emotionally involving as it should be, but this Peter Weir epic offers sweeping ambition and strong performances to go with its grand visual spectacle.\"[14] Empire awarded the film three out of five stars and said \"It's good, but from this director we have come to expect great.\"[15] The Guardian awarded it three out of five and said \"Weir has put together a good film – oddly, though, considering its scale, it feels like a rather small one.\"[16] The Telegraph called the film \"A journey that feels awful and heroic and unfathomable – and one you’ll want to watch again.\"[17]","m_production":"The film is loosely based on The Long Walk (1955), Sławomir Rawicz's memoir depicting his alleged escape from a Siberian Gulag and subsequent 4,000-mile walk to freedom in Nepal.The book sold over 500,000 copies and is credited with inspiring many explorers. In 2006, the BBC unearthed records (including some written by Rawicz himself) which showed that, rather than having escaped from the gulag, he had in fact been released by the USSR in 1942.[2][3] In May 2009, Witold Gliński, a Polish World War II veteran living in the United Kingdom, came forward to claim that the basis of Rawicz's story was true, but it was actually an account of what had happened to him, not Rawicz. Glinski's claims have also been seriously questioned.[4][5][6][7] In addition, in 1942, a group of Siberian Gulag escapees is said to have hiked into Nepal.[2] However, this too is suspect.[4][8][9] Though the director Peter Weir continues to claim that the so-called long walk happened, he himself now describes The Way Back as \"essentially a fictional film\".[2][10][11] | Regardless of whether or not this particular \"long walk\" really took place, during World War II other Poles undertook difficult journeys attempting to leave the Soviet Union. Accounts of their escapes can be found in the archives of the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London, and in the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, in California.[12] Also, several relatively verifiable and believable escapee autobiographies have been published in English, e.g., Michael Krupa's Shallow Graves in Siberia.[citation needed] | Many of the events that happen in the gulag scenes come from Varlam Shalamov's The Kolyma Tales, such as the scene where the man is killed for his sweater. | Laurence Harvey and Herbert Wilcox announced plans to make a film from The Long Walk in 1957.[13] | Principal photography took place in Bulgaria, Morocco, and India.[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Long Walk  by Sławomir Rawicz","m_directed_by":"Peter Weir","m_produced_by":"Peter Weir Joni Levin Duncan Henderson Nigel Sinclair Scott Rudin","m_screenplay_by":"Peter Weir Keith Clarke","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jim Sturgess Ed Harris Saoirse Ronan Colin Farrell","m_music_by":"Burkhard Dallwitz","m_cinematography":"Russell Boyd","m_edited_by":"Lee Smith","m_production_company":"National Geographic Films Spitfire Pictures Imagenation Abu Dhabi Film Fund Luxembourg","m_distributed_by":"Newmarket Films Exclusive Film Distribution Meteor Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 3, 2010 (2010-09-03) (Telluride Film Festival) | December 29, 2010 (2010-12-29) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"127 minutes","m_country":null,"m_language":"English Russian","m_budget":"$30 million[1]","m_box_office":"$20,348,249[1] | The Way Back is a 2010 survival drama film directed by Peter Weir, from a screenplay by Weir and Keith Clarke.
