{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film focusses on the life of Jeannie, a woman from the upper classes of society, and her story of adapting to life in the outback of Australia. Following her marriage to Aeneas Gunn who has just bought a 1 million acre cattle station near Mataranka, called Elsey Station, Jeannie follows him from Melbourne in 1902. Some of the drovers were unhappy at first because they believed that the bush is no place for a white woman. As such, they were both wary of her and made fun of her when both her and her husband arrived. However, Jeannie was determined to prove them wrong. | While her husband was away with the other men herding the cattle, Jeannie begins making friends with the Aboriginal people. Her husband and the other white men treated the local people (and Chinese workers) as inferior to them, often regarding them as lazy, indifferent, as well as unreliable. Jeannie however is sympathetic, often giving them food, or trying to stop domestic disputes. | Later, Aeneas goes on a cattle muster and asks Jeannie to come along, which she does gladly. However the trip is difficult for her, riding side-saddle, she is also nearly attacked by a rogue bull. However, as time passes, things improve at the station - the house is expanded, a new Chinese cook arrives, a garden is planted, as well as her belongings finally arrive from Melbourne. | But boredom sets in as she assumes her place - that of the station master's wife. She is asked not to help a feverish yet dying man, or to interfere with the balance of things, or to give the Aboriginal people goods meant for the working men. As a result, she spends more time with the locals, since she longs to learn and understand more about their ways. Jeannie even takes a semi-orphaned mixed-heritage child called Bett-Bett under her wing, much to the dismay of her husband. | Over time Jeannie gains the respect of the Aboriginal people and they slowly open up to her. At one point, Goggle Eye, an elder Aboriginal male, allows her to watch an Aboriginal dance. The stockmen however interrupt the \"heathen\" dance, shooting and shouting \"God save King Edward\". Later, Bett-Bett goes on walkabout and Goggle Eye becomes ill and feverish. Believing that he has been affected by a singing curse Goggle Eye passes away. The stockmen feel some mixed remorse, acknowledging their role in his death. | Soon it is Christmas and the Aboriginal people are treated a little better after what happened. In the spirit of Christmas, many of the provisions are given away and a large traditional Christmas meal is prepared for the westerners. It is here that Aeneas announces his intention, after their first year, to stay on at the station. Just when Jeannie thinks she is accustomed to the life in the harsh outback, Aeneas also becomes feverish and dies, leaving her alone on the station. However, Bett-Bett returns from walkabout and asks to stay with her in the house.","m_cast":"Angela Punch McGregor ... Jeannie Gunn | Arthur Dignam ... Aeneas Gunn | Martin Vaughan ...

The original producer was John B. Murray, who was then head of production for the Adams-Packer company.[2] | The film was shot on location in the Northern Territory at Elsey Station and Mataranka - the same setting as the novel. It was produced with the assistance of the Northern Territory Government, the Film Corporation of Western Australia, and the Victorian Film Corporation. Filming took 13 weeks from April to June in 1981. | Four weeks into the shoot the production was behind schedule.[3] John B Murray was replaced as producer by Greg Tepper, who had been production manager for Fred Schepisi.[2] | The original budget was $2.5 million but the film ended up going $700,000 over due to high transportation costs. Igor Auzins later argued that pre-production on the film was not as tightly organised as it should have been.[1][2] | Angela Punch McGregor later complained that only half of the script was shot: | A lot of good action scenes were cut because of the restrictions on time and budget, much to my disappointment and anger then. We ended up with a very slow-moving narrative and a more intellectual film than I had anticipated...
