{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Investment banker Laurel Ayres (Whoopi Goldberg) is a smart and single woman trying to make it up the Wall Street corporate ladder, until one day she finds out that she is passed over for a promotion because she is a woman. Unable to face the fact that her less intelligent male protege, Frank Peterson (Tim Daly), has now become her boss, she quits and tries to start up her own company only to find out that the male dominated world of Wall Street is not interested in taking an African American woman seriously, and thus is forced to create a fictional white man, Robert S. Cutty (inspired by a bottle of Cutty Sark) in order to be judged on her own merits. Ayres' financial wisdom is joined by the intelligent and computer-savvy secretary Sally Dugan (Dianne Wiest), who also was not properly recognized for her talents. Together they are able to become the most successful independent stockbrokers in the world while helping a struggling high-tech computer company stay afloat. | However, the ruse eventually runs into problems, as Cutty is still getting credit for Ayres' great ideas, and competing firms and tabloid journalists are willing to do anything in order to bring the wealthy and elusive Cutty into the public and on their side. Thus Ayres is forced to get her best friend (who works at a nightclub as a female impersonator) to create an effective disguise in the mould of Marlon Brando to try to fool the naysayers; when that fails, she and Dugan decide to kill Cutty only to be charged with his murder. Frank uncovers the ruse and pretends that he is now the front man to world-famous Cutty. | The film ends with Ayres donning the Cutty disguise one last time to attend a meeting of the exclusive gentlemen's club to accept Cutty's awards and unmasking herself in order to teach the male-dominated industry the evils of racial and sexual discrimination. Ayres is finally given credit for her work and creates a huge business empire with her friends at the helm. Frank attempts to land a job with the business, only to be laughed off.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"El Socio  by Jenaro Prieto | L'Associé  by Jean-Claude Carrière (uncredited) and René Gainville (uncredited)","m_directed_by":"Donald Petrie","m_produced_by":"Frederic Golchan | Adam Leipzig | Patrick Markey","m_screenplay_by":"Nick Thiel","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Whoopi Goldberg | Dianne Wiest | Eli Wallach | Tim Daly | Bebe Neuwirth","m_music_by":"Christopher Tyng","m_cinematography":"Alex Nepomniaschy","m_edited_by":"Bonnie Koehler","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 25, 1996 (1996-10-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"113 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$12.8 million[2] | The Associate is a 1996 American comedy film directed by Donald Petrie and written by Nick Thiel.
