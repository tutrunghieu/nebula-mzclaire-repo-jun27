{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins), a billionaire with an exception memory, Robert \"Bob\" Green (Alec Baldwin), a photographer, and Stephen (Harold Perrineau), Bob's assistant, arrive in a remote Alaskan locale via Charles' private jet, along with Charles' much-younger wife, Mickey (Elle Macpherson), a beautiful fashion model. During the next leg of the journey aboard a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Charles reads a wilderness survival book. The group, at the lodge for a fashion photo shoot are the only guests. Styles (L.Q. Jones), the proprietor, warns everyone about not leaving food uncovered due to bears. | At night, Mickey sends Charles to the kitchen. There Charles finds a ham left out next to an open door. He nervously closes the door and is then surprised with a midnight birthday party. Mickey gives him an engraved pocket watch while Bob's present is an expensive hunting knife. | The next day, during Mickey's photo shoot, Charles observes Bob and Mickey kissing, though it may be platonic. The group, minus Mickey, fly to a location to try and recruit a photogenic local man for their shoot. The man has left a note on his door stating he is miles away hunting. Bob absentmindedly pockets the note. Before leaving, Charles uses his new wilderness knowledge to warn the group to avoid a deadfall that is outside the cabin. They fly north where the man is supposed to be hunting. | In mid-air, Charles cryptically asks Bob how he is planning to kill him. Before the conversation progresses, the plane strikes a flock of birds and nose-dives into a lake, killing the pilot. Charles, Bob, and Stephen barely reach shore. Because Bob pocketed the note, they are now twenty miles from where anyone will likely search for them. | Lost, wet, and freezing, the three men attempt to hike to a more likely search area, only to find they are being stalked by a Kodiak bear. While crossing a makeshift bridge over a narrow river channel, Charles falls into the rapids. Bob grabs him downstream, saving his life, leaving Charles doubting his earlier suspicions about Bob. | Stephen cuts his leg while making a fishing spear. Charles stops the bleeding with a rag which Bob deliberately leaves exposed where its scent can attract bears. That night, the bear attacks and fatally mauls Stephen. | Charles draws upon his newly-acquired survival skills to guide him and Bob; they bond somewhat, though an air of mistrust still separates them. Tired and hungry, they find their way back to the river. The bear appears and the two narrowly escape. While running, they spot a search and rescue helicopter but fail to signal it. | Charles resolves to bait the bear and kill it. Bob, despondent, is rallied by Charles' admonition, \"What one man can do, another can do!\". Armed with hand-carved spears, they lure the bear into a trap but it fails to injure the bear significantly. The bear begins mauling Bob. Charles distracts the bear, luring it away. Charles grounds his spear into a crevice and angles it toward the beast. As the bear pounces, it is impaled. | Now following the river south, the men find an empty hunters' cabin. Bob rushes in, while Charles notices another deadfall trapping pit. The cabin contains some supplies: liquor, tea, matches, wood, a stove, a rifle with bullets, and a canoe. Bob grabs the rifle. Charles reasons that the river should lead back to the lakeside lodge. | Charles finds a receipt in his pocket and uses it as tinder to start a fire. As he is about to light the receipt, he notices the three items on it that were bought together: the hunting knife Bob gave him, the watch from his wife, and another watch Mickey bought for Bob engraved with an intimate message reading \"For All the Nights\". Charles realizes that Bob and Mickey are having an affair and that Bob plans to kill him for his wealth and wife. Bob orders Charles outside; and, as Bob is about to shoot him, Charles maneuvers Bob into stepping backward into the trapping pit. | Bob suffers a mortal wound; but, rather than leaving him to die, Charles transports him downriver in the canoe. He makes camp with a fire to keep Bob warm. Bob apologizes for betraying Charles and says Mickey was unaware he intended to murder Charles. A rescue helicopter appears, but Bob dies before it lands. | At the lodge, as Bob's body is removed from the helicopter, Charles hands Bob's watch to Mickey, his expression indicates that he knows about her adultery. He then declares to the gathered press that the other men died, \"saving my life,\" suggesting that the experience has profoundly changed him and given him a new outlook on life.","m_cast":"Anthony Hopkins as Charles Morse | Alec Baldwin as Robert \"Bob\" Green | Harold Perrineau as Stephen | Elle Macpherson as Mickey Morse | L.Q.

Among the Alberta locations were Banff National Park, Canmore, Edmonton, Thunderstone Quarries, Fortress Ski Resort and Allarcom Studios. Additional scenes were shot in Yoho National Park and Golden, both in British Columbia.[2] | The shooting of the film is discussed by Art Linson in his 2002 book What Just Happened?, later made into a film starring Robert De Niro. Initially called Bookworm, the script was turned down by Harrison Ford and Dustin Hoffman before Alec Baldwin settled on the role of Green. De Niro showed some interest in the role of Morse but ultimately declined. Baldwin's unwillingness to shave a beard that he had grown for the role is reenacted by Bruce Willis in Barry Levinson's adaptation of Linson's book. | Like many other actors who had worked with Bart the Bear, Baldwin was extremely impressed with how well-trained and docile the bear was. Baldwin commented that Bart \"should send the film editor a fruit basket every day for making him look so scary.\"[3] As for Hopkins, who had worked with Bart in Legends of the Fall, he \"was absolutely brilliant with Bart,\" according to trainer Lynn Seus, who went on to say that Hopkins \"acknowledged and respected (Bart) like a fellow actor. He would spend hours just looking at Bart and admiring him. He did so many of his own scenes with Bart.\"[4] | Three months before the film was to be released, the studio felt Bookworm needed a more commercial title. Dozens of others were considered, according to Linson, until the film was renamed The Edge.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lee Tamahori","m_produced_by":"Art Linson","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Anthony Hopkins Alec Baldwin Harold Perrineau Elle Macpherson L.
