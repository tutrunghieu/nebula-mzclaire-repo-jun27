{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Facing foreclosure of their homes in the Goon Docks area of Astoria, Oregon to an expanding country club, a group of children called the \"Goonies\" gathers for a last weekend. The Goonies include optimist Mikey Walsh, his older brother Brand, the inventive Data, the talkative Mouth, and the overweight klutz Chunk. While rummaging through the Walshes' attic, they come across a 1632 doubloon and an old treasure map purporting to lead to the famous pirate \"One-Eyed\" Willy's hoard located nearby. Evading Brand for one last adventure together, the kids find themselves at a derelict restaurant near the coast, which coincides with the doubloon and the map. They encounter the Fratellis, a family of criminals hiding out at the restaurant. Evading detection by returning outside, the kids run into Brand and two girls: the popular cheerleader Andy, who has a crush on Brand, who shares the same feelings for her, and Stef, a nerdy, tough-talking girl and Andy's best friend. | Mikey convinces Brand to return to the restaurant to explore after the Fratellis leave, discovering that the criminals are running a counterfeiting operation. As the Fratellis return, the group finds a tunnel beneath the restaurant and hides in there, sending Chunk to notify the authorities. They explore the tunnel and find the remains of a previous treasure explorer, who also searched for the treasure, and Mikey is sure they are on the right trail. Evading various booby traps, set up by Willy, they find themselves under an old wishing well. The kids have a chance to be pulled out of the tunnel by Andy's obnoxious boyfriend Troy, whose family owns the country club, but Mikey convinces the group to continue on their journey. Meanwhile, Chunk, who has escaped the restaurant, tries to flag down several passing cars, but is intercepted and kidnapped by Jake and Francis Fratelli. When the Fratellis threaten to shred his hands with an active blender, a terrified Chunk reveals not only where his friends are, but also the existence of the treasure. The Fratellis tie Chunk to a chair and lock him in the basement next to Sloth, their deformed younger brother kept chained to the wall. The Fratellis pursue both the Goonies and the treasure. Chunk befriends Sloth, and Sloth is able to break their bonds; they form a third party headed into the tunnel. | Mikey and the others discover the Fratellis on their tail, and hasten through the remaining traps. They ultimately find an enclosed grotto and Willy's pirate ship, the Inferno, which ahs been sealed in the cave for decades. They explore the ship, finding a hoard of treasure in front of the skeletal remains of Willy and his crew. Mikey gives a sober speech to Willy, naming him as the first \"Goonie\", then he and the others fill their pockets with riches; Mikey insists that the coins directly in front of Willy remain untouched, as Willy's tribute. As they leave, however, the Fratellis have already caught up with them. They make them drop the treasure before threatening to kill them by forcing them to walk the plank, when suddenly Sloth and Chunk arrive. Sloth, angered by how the other Fratellis have treated him in the past, easily subdues them and helps the rest of the Goonies to escape the boat. Though Mikey insists they go back for the treasure, Brand worries more for their lives, and the group escapes through a hole in the grotto, eventually arriving on a nearby beach shore. Police quickly come to their help and reunite them with their families. | Meanwhile, the Fratellis free themselves and begin to loot the boat. When they take the coins that Mikey had left earlier, they trip another booby trap that causes the grotto to start to cave in. The Fratellis are forced to abandon the loot and flee to the beach, where police quickly take them into custody. As the Goonies are taken care of by their families, including Chunk offering to bring Sloth into his family, the owners of the country club show up and demand that Mr. Walsh sign away their homes and the Goon Docks. As he is about to do so, their housekeeper Rosalita finds Mikey's marble bag in his wet clothes, filled with gems that the Fratellis had neglected to check. Mr. Walsh triumphantly tears up the paperwork, as the gems are more than enough to negate the forclosure. As the Goonies celebrate, the attention of all on the beach is caught by the sight of the unmanned Inferno, now clear of the grotto, and the Goonies wave her goodbye as she sets off at full sail.","m_cast":"Sean Astin as Michael \"Mikey\" Walsh | Corey Feldman as Clark \"Mouth\" Devereaux | Ke Huy Quan as Richard \"Data\" Wang | Josh Brolin as Brandon \"Brand\" Walsh | Jeff Cohen as Lawrence \"Chunk\" Cohen | Kerri Green as Andrea \"Andy\" Carmichael | Martha Plimpton as Stephanie \"Stef\" Steinbrenner | Anne Ramsey as Agatha \"Mama\" Fratelli | Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli | Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli | John Matuszak as Lotney \"Sloth\" Fratelli | Mary Ellen Trainor as Irene Walsh | Keith Walker as Irving Walsh | Lupe Ontiveros as Rosalita | Steve Antin as Troy Perkins | Curtis F.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 70% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10 and the critical consensus: \"An energetic, sometimes noisy mix of Spielbergian sentiment and funhouse tricks that will appeal to kids and nostalgic adults alike.\"[13] At Metacritic it has a rating score of 60, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[14] Several reviewers noted that the film appeared to be enjoyable for children and teens, but not so much for adults.[15] | The Goonies grossed US$9 million in its opening weekend in the US, second on the charts behind Rambo: First Blood Part II.[16] It grossed over US$61 million that year, placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1985 (in the US).[17] | Ramsey won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role.[18] At the 7th Youth in Film Awards (now known as Young Artist Awards), Astin's portrayal of Mikey won the award for Best Starring Performance By a Young Actor in a Motion Picture. Cohen, Feldman, and Plimpton were also nominated for awards for their performances in The Goonies. The film itself was nominated for best adventure motion picture.[19]","m_production":"Principal photography on The Goonies began on October 22, 1984 and lasted five months. There was an additional six weeks of audio dubbing recording.[4] The shooting script was lengthy, over 120 pages, and several sequences were eventually cut from the final theatrical version. During the film's dénouement, mention is made of an octopus which refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut. | In The Making of The Goonies, director Richard Donner notes the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. Donner praises them for their energy and excitement, but says that they were a handful when brought together. The documentary frequently shows him coaching the young actors and reveals some techniques he used to get realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was actually an impressive full-sized mock-up of a pirate ship created under the direction of production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the child actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters. The characters' first glimpse of the ship was thus basically also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the movie is actually the second shot, as the cast was so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be re-shot. It was later noted that the entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it.[5] | In his book There and Back Again, Sean Astin claims that Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg were \"like codirectors\" on the film as he compares and contrasts their styles when directing scenes.[6] | Some of the on-location filming was done in Astoria, Oregon. The interior and exterior of the old Clatsop County Jail features as the holding place of Jake Fratelli at the start of the film. (The building was later converted into the Oregon Film Museum, which opened on the 25th anniversary of The Goonies with memorabilia from this and other local films.)[7] The museum where Mikey's father works is, in reality, the Captain George Flavel House Museum. The Walsh family home is a real home at 368 38th Street.[7] The scenes along the coast were filmed in Oregon, but they were a considerable distance from Astoria. The Goonies bicycle to Ecola State Park (in reality, over 26 miles south of Astoria) and then find the starting location of the map using Haystack Rock as a guide. Underground scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, including the cavernous set where the Goonies find One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was in Stage 16, one of the largest sound stages in America.[8] The final scene was shot at Goat Rock State Beach in Sonoma County, California.
