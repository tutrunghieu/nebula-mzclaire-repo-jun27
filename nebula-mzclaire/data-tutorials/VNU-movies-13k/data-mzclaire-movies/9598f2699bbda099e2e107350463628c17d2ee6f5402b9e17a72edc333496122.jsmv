{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A Sunday in the life of Derrick King, an Irish kid raised in South Central L.A. by a black family. He talks black, dresses black, and thinks of himself as black. It is a day of disasters: his mom kicks him out of the house, his uncle fires him, the woman he loves dismisses him as childish, the LAPD (wearing Confederate flag shoulder patches) impounds his car and tosses him in the drunk tank, a mean dude is after him for money, he is imprisoned in a store basement by gay sadists, and he is shot at. Along the way, however, he shows kindness to a near-sighted kid, and those random acts may prove to be his salvation. Rappers Xzibit and Flesh-n-Bone appear in the film. | The movie features numerous parodies, including one of Pulp Fiction, as well as Good Will Hunting, and an appearance by George Clinton as himself. Professional basketball player Gary Payton also has a speaking role in the movie.","m_cast":"Mitch Mullany as Derrick King | Lamont Bentley as Darryl | Carl Anthony Payne II as Chris | Loretta Devine as Floria | Paul Benjamin as Clerk | George Clinton as Himself | Xzibit as Jamal","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Eric Meza","m_produced_by":"Bob Shapiro Terry Spazek","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mitch Mullany Carl Anthony Payne II Paula Jai Parker Clifton Powell Darius McCrary Paul Benjamin Lamont Bentley with Loretta Devine","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Carlos Gonz√°lez","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Artisan Entertainment","m_release_dates":"February 26, 1999","m_running_time":"86 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Breaks is an American 1999 comedy film written by and starring Mitch Mullany and directed by Eric Meza.","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Breaks at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/The_Breaks_FilmPoster.jpeg/220px-The_Breaks_FilmPoster.jpeg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Mitch Mullany Jeff Stolzer"}
