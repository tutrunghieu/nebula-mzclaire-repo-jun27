{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Dave Skylark, host of the talk show Skylark Tonight, interviews celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Dave and his crew celebrate their 1,000th episode, Aaron Rapaport, the show's producer, is upset by a person from the same business, criticizing Skylark Tonight as not being a real news program as it only covers entertainment and gossips. A while later Aaron reveals his concern and urge for change, which Dave agrees. Dave discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of Skylark Tonight, prompting Aaron to arrange an interview. Aaron travels to rural China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Aaron accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Dave. | The next day, CIA Agent Lacey shows up at Dave and Aaron's place, proposing that Dave and Aaron assassinate Kim using a transdermal strip that will expose Kim to ricin via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Dave carries the Ricin Strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in Pyongyang, they are introduced to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the ricin strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. Lacey airdrops two more strips from a UAV and Aaron smuggles them into the palace by hiding the container in his rectum, escaping a Siberian tiger in the process. | Dave spends the day with Kim, playing basketball and partying. Kim persuades Dave that he is misunderstood as a cruel dictator and as a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a seizure and inadvertently kills Yu before dying. The next morning, Dave feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Aaron's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After a dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Dave witnesses Kim's malicious side; and after taking a walk and discovering that a nearby grocery store is merely a façade, Dave realizes that Kim has been lying to him. | At the same time, during attempted sex with Aaron, who still has the ricin band in his hand, Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Dave, Aaron, and Sook-yin form a plan to break Kim's cult of personality by causing him to cry on air. During the internationally televised interview with Kim, Dave addresses increasingly sensitive topics and challenges Kim's need for his father's approval. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably and soils himself after Dave sings \"Firework\" (having learned of Kim's fondness of Katy Perry earlier), ruining his reputation. Sook-yin and Aaron seize control of the broadcasting center and fend off guards trying to halt the broadcast. | Kim shoots Dave, who survives due to a bulletproof vest under his shirt. Dave, Aaron, and Sook-yin regroup and escape the presidential palace, hijacking Kim's Soviet tank to get to their pickup point. Kim boards a helicopter and pursues the group with the military. He prepares nuclear missiles, but before he can issue the command to launch, Dave fires a shell from the tank and destroys Kim's helicopter, killing everyone on board. With the immediate threat over, Sook guides Dave and Aaron to an escape route, and they are rescued by SEAL Team Six members disguised as Korean People's Army troops. Back in the US, Dave writes a book about his experience, and North Korea moves toward becoming a denuclearized democracy with Sook-yin as interim leader.","m_cast":"Seth Rogen as Aaron Rapaport | James Franco as Dave Skylark | Lizzy Caplan as Agent Lacey | Randall Park as Kim Jong-un | Diana Bang as Sook-yin Park | Timothy Simons as Malcolm | Reese Alexander as Agent Botwin | Anders Holm as Jake | James Yi as Officer Koh | Paul Bae as Officer Yu | Geoff Gustafson as Cole | Charles Rahi Chun as General Jong | The film also features cameos from Eminem, Rob Lowe, Bill Maher, Seth Meyers, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Schwartz, Brian Williams, and Scott Pelley. Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, Emma Stone, Zac Efron, and Guy Fieri appear in the title graphic for Skylark Tonight. | In November 2014, following a cyber-attack that stole and leaked company information, it was revealed that Rogen and Franco were reported to have been paid $8.4 million and $6.5 million respectively from the $44 million budgeted film.[6] Hackers also revealed that Kevin Federline was paid $5,000 for a cameo appearance.[6] According to documents, Jay-Z and Beyoncé were reportedly paid $10,000 each to cameo,[7] but do not appear in the film.[8]","m_reception":"The Interview opened to a limited release in the United States on December 25, 2014, across 331 theaters[77] and earned over $1 million on its opening day. Variety called the opening gross \"an impressive launch for a title playing in only about 300 independent theaters in the U.S.\"[78] It went on to earn over $1.8 million in its opening weekend, and by the end of its run on January 25, 2015, had grossed $6.1 million at the box office.[79] | Within four days of its online release on December 24, 2014, The Interview earned over $15 million through online rentals and purchases. It became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing online release, outselling Arbitrage ($14 million), Bachelorette ($8.2 million), and Snowpiercer ($7 million).[80] It is the top-selling Google Play and YouTube film of 2014.[81] By January 20, 2015, the film had earned more than $40 million from online sales and rentals.[82] | Sony expected The Interview to break even through video-on-demand sales and saving millions of dollars on marketing.[83] The National Association of Theater Owners contended that Sony would lose at least $30 million due to poor box office performance.[84] | On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 52% approval rating, based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Unfortunately overshadowed by controversy (and under-screened as a result), The Interview's screenplay offers middling laughs bolstered by its two likable leads.\"[85] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[86] | IGN's Roth Cornet wrote that \"though it's unlikely to stand out as one of the shrewdest political satires of its time, [it] is a clever, unrestrained and—most importantly—sidesplitting parody that pokes fun at both a vapid media and one of the world's most dangerous dictators.\"[87] Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net said the film was \"hilarious, but it will probably get us nuked\".[88] Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that \"if this unessential but agreeable movie really triggered an international response, this is life reflecting art in a major way.\"[89] | Scott Foundas of Variety panned the film as \"cinematic waterboarding\" and \"about as funny as a communist food shortage, and just as protracted\", but praised the performances of Randall Park and Diana Bang.[17] Mike Hale of The New York Times also praised Park and Bang, but wrote that \"after seeing The Interview and the ruckus its mere existence has caused, the only sensible reaction is amazement at the huge disconnect between the innocuousness of the film and the viciousness of the response.\"[90] | In the wake of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, leaks revealed e-mails between Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton and RAND Corporation defense analyst Bruce Bennett from June 2014. Bennett advised against toning down The Interview's graphic Jong-un death scene, in the hope that it would \"start some real thinking in South Korea and, I believe, in the North once the DVD leaks into the North\". Bennett expressed his view that \"the only resolution I can see to the North Korean nuclear and other threats is for the North Korean government to eventually go away\", which he felt would be likeliest to occur following an assassination of Kim. Lynton replied that a senior figure in the United States Department of State agreed. Bennett responded that the office of Robert R. King, U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, had determined that the North Korean statements had been \"typical North Korean bullying, likely without follow-up\".[91] | In an interview with CNN, Bennett said Lynton sits on the board of trustees of the RAND Corporation, which had asked Bennett to talk to Lynton and give his opinion on the film.[92] Bennett felt The Interview was \"coarse\" and \"over the top\", but that \"the depiction of Kim Jong-un was a picture that needed to get into North Korea. There are a lot of people in prison camps in North Korea who need to take advantage of a change of thinking in the north.\" Bennett felt that if the DVD were smuggled into the country it might have an effect \"over time\".[93] Bennett contacted the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, a personal friend of his, who \"took the standard government approach: we don't tell industry what to do\".[92] Jen Psaki, a spokesperson for the United States Department of State, confirmed that Daniel R. Russel, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, had spoken to Sony executives; she reiterated that \"entertainers are free to make movies of their choosing, and we are not involved in that\".[94]","m_production":"Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg developed the idea for The Interview in late 2000, joking about what would happen if a journalist was required to assassinate a world leader.[9] Initially, screenwriter Dan Sterling wrote his script based on a fake dictator from a fake country, but Rogen, Goldberg, and Sony executives asked him to rewrite the script focusing on Jong-un.[10] The screenplay was then titled Kill Kim Jong Un.[11] They picked North Korea leader Kim Jong-il, but put the project on hold until Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Development resumed when Rogen and Goldberg realized that Jong-un is closer to their own age, which they felt would be more humorous. To write the story, co-written with Daily Show writer Dan Sterling, they researched meticulously by reading non-fiction books and watching video footage about North Korea. The script was later reviewed by an employee in the State Department.[12] Rogen and Goldberg aimed to make the project more relevant and satirical than their previous films while retaining toilet humor.[9] They were pleased when former NBA star Dennis Rodman visited North Korea, as it reinforced their belief that the premise of the film was realistic.[9] | In March 2013, it was announced that Rogen and Goldberg would direct a comedy film for Columbia Pictures in which Rogen would star alongside James Franco, with Franco playing a talk-show host and Rogen playing his producer.[13] Rogen and Goldberg were on board to produce along with James Weaver through Point Grey Pictures, while Columbia was said to finance the $30 million budgeted film.[13] Lizzy Caplan joined the film's cast in October 2013. Caplan signed on to play Agent Lacey, a CIA agent who tries to get Franco's character to assassinate the Korean prime minister.[14] Randall Park and Timothy Simons signed on to co-star later that month. Park plays the North Korean prime minister Kim Jong-Un and Simons the director of the talk show.[15][16] Park was the first to audition for the role of Kim and got the part immediately. Before filming began, Park gained 15 pounds and shaved his head to resemble Jong-un's crew cut. His role was praised by critics.[9][17] Although Rogen and Goldberg wrote the character of Kim as \"robotic and strict\", Park instead played it \"sheepish and shy\", which they found more humorous.[9] Diana Bang was cast as Sook-yin Park, for which she was well received by critics.[17][18] | Principal photography on the film began in Vancouver, British Columbia, on October 10, 2013,[19] and concluded on December 20, 2013.[20] There are hundreds of visual effects in the film; a crowd scene at the Pyongyang airport, for example, was digitally manipulated with a shot from 22 Jump Street.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Seth Rogen | Evan Goldberg","m_produced_by":"Seth Rogen | Evan Goldberg | James Weaver","m_screenplay_by":"Dan Sterling","m_story_by":"Seth Rogen | Evan Goldberg | Dan Sterling","m_starring":"Seth Rogen | James Franco","m_music_by":"Henry Jackman","m_cinematography":"Brandon Trost","m_edited_by":"Zene Baker | Evan Henke","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 11, 2014 (2014-12-11) (Los Angeles) | December 24, 2014 (2014-12-24) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"112 minutes[2]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | Korean","m_budget":"$44 million[3][4]","m_box_office":"$11.3 million[5] | The Interview is a 2014 American political satire comedy film directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. It is their second directorial work, following This Is the End (2013). The screenplay is by Dan Sterling, based upon a story he co-authored with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and James Franco as journalists who set up an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Randall Park), and are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. | Rogen and Goldberg developed the idea for The Interview in the late 2000s, with Kim Jong-il as the original assassination target. In 2011, after Jong-il's death, Jong-un replaced him as the North Korean leader. Rogen and Goldberg re-developed the script with the focus on Jong-un's character. The announcement for the film was made in March 2013, along with the beginning of pre-production. Principal photography took place in Vancouver from October to December 2013. | In June 2014, the North Korean government threatened action against the United States if Columbia Pictures released the film. Columbia delayed the release from October to December, and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more acceptable to North Korea. In November, the computer systems of parent company Sony Pictures Entertainment were hacked by the \"Guardians of Peace\", a group the FBI claims has ties to North Korea. The group also threatened terrorist attacks against cinemas that showed the film. Major cinema chains opted not to release the film, leading Sony to release it for online rental and purchase on December 24, 2014, followed by a limited release at select cinemas the next day. | The Interview grossed $40 million in digital rentals, making it Sony's most successful digital release, and earned an additional $11.2 million worldwide at the box office on a $44 million budget. It received mixed reviews for its humor and subject matter, although critics praised the performances of Rogen, Franco, Park and Diana Bang. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Vary, Adam B.
