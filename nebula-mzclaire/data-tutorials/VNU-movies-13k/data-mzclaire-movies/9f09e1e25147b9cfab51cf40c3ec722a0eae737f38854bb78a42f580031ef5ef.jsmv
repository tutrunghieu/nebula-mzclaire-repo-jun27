{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A financially strained, aging Los Angeles private detective named Ira Wells isn't a well man and is barely active in the business. He is a loner who doesn't much care for company or small talk. When his ex-partner Harry Regan, however, shows up at Ira's boarding house one night mortally wounded while on a case, Ira feels it's up to him to get to the bottom of it. | The trail leads Ira to a small-time fence named Birdwell, whose young bodyguard Lamar is only too happy to rough up the old man when Ira pays a call. But they make a mistake in intimidating and underestimating Ira, who ends up paying Lamar back in kind as well as tracking down Birdwell's missing wife. | Meanwhile, a would-be client named Margo Sperling is introduced to Ira by a mutual acquaintance, Charlie Hatter, a tipster. Margo is a quirky individual who acts as an agent for a singer, sells marijuana on the side and wants to hire Ira to find not a murderer but just her missing cat. | As they get to know each other after a rocky start, Ira and Margo hit it off to the point that she offers to become his new partner. But first they need to deal with a dangerous confrontation in Margo's apartment.

Pauline Kael wrote, \"The Late Show never lets up; the editing is by Lou Lombardo (who has often worked with Robert Altman) and Peter Appleton, and I can't think of a thriller from the forties that is as tight as this, or has such sustained tension. ... The Late Show is fast and exciting, but it isn't a thriller, exactly. It's a one-of-a-kind movie—a love-hate poem to sleaziness.\"[5] Also in 1977, Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, \"And most of all, it's a movie that dares a lot, pulls off most of it, and entertains us without insulting our intelligence\" giving the film a four-star rating.[6] A more recent appreciation of the film was penned by Doug Krentzlin in 2014, who called the film \"a unique, one-of-a-kind film that lived up to its advertising tagline, 'The nicest, warmest, funniest, and most touching movie you’ll ever see about blackmail, mystery, and murder.'\"[7] | The Late Show has a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews.[8] | The film received many award nominations, several for Benton's screenplay. Carney's performance won him the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor. Tomlin's performance was nominated for the BAFTA Award and the Golden Globe Award, and she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.[9] The film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. Benton's screenplay was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award (Best Drama Written Directly for the Screen) and for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Benton won the award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay at the Edgar Awards.[10]","m_production":"In early 1976, Robert Benton brought his script to Robert Altman who, after reading it, decided to produce the film. While Benton had co-authored screenplays for several films, he was the sole author for The Late Show, which was also only the second film that Benton directed. Production began in spring of 1976 and wrapped in November.[4] Lou Lombardo, who had a long relationship with Altman and edited several of Altman's films in the 1970s, edited along with Peter Appleton. | Ruth Nelson, playing the landlady Mrs. Schmidt, was a founder of the Group Theatre. It was her first film role since Arch of Triumph in 1948.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Benton","m_produced_by":"Robert Altman Scott Bushnell","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Art Carney Lily Tomlin Bill Macy Eugene Roche Joanna Cassidy","m_music_by":"Kenneth Wannberg","m_cinematography":"Charles Rosher Jr.","m_edited_by":"Peter Appleton Lou Lombardo","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"April 22, 1977","m_running_time":"93 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Late Show is a 1977 neo-noir, mystery film written and directed by Robert Benton and produced by Robert Altman.
