According to a 2013 post on Bosch's Facebook page, the original script called for a lengthy underwater battle using the Zeo Ranger powers, wherein the Power Rangers emerge with tattered costumes. The unused plot would also explained how the Turbo powers were created, It was also originally scripted that Billy Cranston (the original blue ranger) had created the turbo powers with Zordon and Alpha 5. While this plot element was ultimately dropped from the theatrical release, the concept of torn outfits would be used for the Turbo season finale. Also, whereas Hilary Shepard Turner appears as Divatox in the film, by the time filming began for the TV series, she had taken pregnancy leave, thus being replaced by Carol Hoyt; shortly after the episode in which the four veteran Rangers resign and transfer their powers to a new team (filmed after a hiatus of several months), Shepard resumed the role of Divatox, continuing through Power Rangers in Space.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Shuki Levy | David Winning","m_produced_by":"Jonathan Tzachor","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Robert L.
