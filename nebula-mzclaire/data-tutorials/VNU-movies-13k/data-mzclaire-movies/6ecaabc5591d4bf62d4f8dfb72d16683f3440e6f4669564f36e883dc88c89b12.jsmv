{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On May 12, 1984, two beings from the year 2029 arrive in Los Angeles: one is a Terminator, a cyborg assassin programmed to kill a young woman named Sarah Connor; the other is Kyle Reese, a soldier sent to protect her from the Terminator. After the Terminator kills several people (including two other women named \"Sarah Connor\" listed in the telephone directory), it tracks its target to a nightclub. Kyle arrives and saves Sarah from the Terminator. The two steal a car and escape, while the Terminator steals a police car and pursues them. | Kyle explains to Sarah that in the near future, an artificial intelligence defense network known as Skynet will become self-aware and initiate a nuclear holocaust. He mentions that Sarah's yet-to-be-conceived son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet has sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, as a last-ditch effort to avert the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human. | Kyle and Sarah are again attacked by the Terminator, leading to another car chase. Their cars eventually crash into a wall. Kyle and Sarah are caught by the police, but the Terminator escapes. Kyle is questioned by criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman who concludes that he is paranoid and delusional, while Sarah is questioned by Lieutenant Traxler and Sergeant Vukovich. The Terminator goes to a run-down inn, where it performs treatment on itself and reveals how its inner workings function. Soon after, the Terminator attacks the police station, killing many police officers—including Traxler and Vukovich—in its attempt to locate Sarah. Sarah and Kyle manage to escape and spend the night under a bridge before seeking refuge in a motel, where they assemble some pipe bombs. Sarah realizes that the Terminator will find them again, and they are not safe, no matter where they go. Kyle admits that he has been in love with Sarah since John gave him a photograph of her. Sarah reciprocates Kyle's feelings and they have sex. | Later that night, the Terminator tracks them to the motel and Kyle and Sarah escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle throws pipe bombs at the Terminator, but is wounded by the Terminator's gunfire. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle, but loses control of the pickup truck, which flips over. As the Terminator gets up, it is struck by a gasoline tanker truck that drags it a short distance. When the truck driver gets out of the truck, the Terminator hijacks the truck, and continues the chase. Kyle slides a pipe bomb on to the truck's fuel trailer causing a massive explosion. The Terminator emerges from the burning truck covered with flames and collapses, seemingly destroyed. | The Terminator, now with its flesh covering burned away, rises up and continues to pursue them into a factory. Kyle activates the factory's machinery to try to confuse the Terminator and attacks it with a metal pipe but it knocks him down. In a daze, he jams his final pipe bomb into the Terminator's abdomen. Attempting to get away from the blast, Kyle breaks his neck and dies. The pipe bomb inside the Terminator explodes which apparently destroys it. It falls apart and pieces of its debris injures Sarah. As Sarah grieves over Kyle's dead body, the Terminator rises once again and grabs her. She breaks free of its grip, and crawls away. Her injuries slow her down and the Terminator, now a one-armed, legless torso, is right behind her. She leads it into a hydraulic press which she activates, crushing and finally deactivating it. Sarah is later taken out of the factory by an ambulance as Kyle's body is taken away. The authorities also examine the Terminator's components. | Several months later, a pregnant Sarah is traveling through Mexico. Along the way she records audio tapes which she intends to pass on to her unborn son, John. She debates whether to tell him that Kyle is his father. While stopping at a gas station, a small boy takes a Polaroid photograph of her which she purchases— the same photograph that John will later give to Kyle. Sarah then drives on toward approaching storm clouds.","m_cast":"Arnold Schwarzenegger as the The Terminator / T-800 Model 101, a cybernetic android disguised as a human being sent back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor. | Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, a human Resistance fighter sent back in time to protect Sarah. | Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, the Terminator's target who is soon to be the mother of the future Resistance leader John Connor. | Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler, a police Lieutenant who questions Sarah. | Lance Henriksen as Hal Vukovich, a police Sergeant who questions Sarah. | Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman, a criminal psychologist. | Bess Motta as Ginger Ventura, Sarah's roommate. | Rick Rossovich as Matt Buchanan, Ginger's boyfriend. | Additional actors included Dick Miller as the gun-shop clerk; Shawn Schepps as Nancy; Bruce M.

Positive reviews of The Terminator focused on the action scenes and rapid pacing. Variety praised the film, calling it a \"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story ... Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog.\"[81] Richard Corliss of Time magazine said that the film has \"Plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.\"[82] Time placed The Terminator on its \"10 Best\" list for 1984.[52] | The Los Angeles Times called the film \"a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats ... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.\"[52] The Milwaukee Journal gave the film 3 stars, calling it \"the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien.\"[83] A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story ... It's like a streamlined Dirty Harry movie – no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.\"[84] In the May 1985 issue of Cinefantastique it was referred to as a film that \"manages to be both derivative and original at the same time ... not since the Road Warrior has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage\" and \"an example of science fiction/horror at its best ... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity\".[85] In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.[85][86] | Other reviews focused on the film's level of violence and story-telling quality. The New York Times opined that the film was a \"B-movie with flair. Much of it ... has suspense and personality, and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull. There is far too much of the latter, in the form of car chases, messy shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger's slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way.\"[87] The Pittsburgh Press wrote a negative review, calling the film \"just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like Streets of Fire and Blade Runner.\"[88] The Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars, adding that \"at times it's horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style actually helps, providing a little humor just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey.\"[89] The Newhouse News Service called the film a \"lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap\".[90] British author Gilbert Adair called the film \"repellent to the last degree\", charging it with \"insidious Nazification\" and charging that it had an \"appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism, fashion and fascination.\"[91] The film won three Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, best make-up and best writing.[92] | In 1991, Richard Schickel of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film\" and called it \"one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made.\"[93] Film4 gave the film five stars, calling it the \"sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.\"[94] TV Guide gave the film four stars referring to it as an \"amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget ... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.\"[95] Empire gave the film five stars calling it \"As chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets.\"[96] The film database Allmovie gave the film five stars, saying that it \"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.\"[97] | Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as \"slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures.\"[98] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.7/10 based on 50 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why The Terminator continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.\"[99] The film also holds a score of 83/100 (\"universal acclaim\") on review aggregator website Metacritic.[100] The Terminator has received recognition from the American Film Institute. The film ranked 42nd on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills, a list of America's most heart-pounding films.[101] The character of the Terminator was selected as the 22nd-greatest movie villain on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains.[102] Arnold's catch phrase \"I'll be back\" was voted the 37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.[103] In 2005, Total Film named The Terminator the 72nd-best film ever made.[104] In 2008, Empire magazine selected The Terminator as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[105] Empire also placed the T-800 14th on their list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[106] In 2008, The Terminator was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.[107] | The film initiated a long-running Terminator franchise, which currently consists of five films and several adaptations in other media.[108][109] Biographer Laurence Leamer writes that The Terminator, \"was an influential film affecting a whole generation of darkly hued science fiction, and it was one of Arnold's best performances.\"[110]","m_production":"In Rome, Italy, during the release of Piranha II: The Spawning, director Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso dragging itself from an explosion while holding kitchen knives.[5] \"My contemporaries were all doing slasher-horror movies,\" Cameron said. \"John Carpenter was the guy I idolized the most. He made Halloween for $30,000 or something. That was everyone's break-in dream, to do a stylish horror movie. [Cameron's nightmare] was a very slasher film type image. And it really was the launching pad for the story.\"[6] When Cameron returned to Pomona, California, he stayed at Randall Frakes' home where he wrote a draft for The Terminator.[7] Cameron later stated that his influences while writing the script were 1950s science fiction films and episodes of The Outer Limits as well as contemporary films including The Driver and Mad Max 2.[8][9] To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher the early scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department scenes to write. As Wisher lived far away from Cameron, the two communicated script ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone. | Cameron's agent resented the idea for The Terminator and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.[10] The initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry.[11] Cameron could not think of a good way to depict this robot, stating that he \"was seeing things in his head that couldn't be done with existing technology.\"[11][12] Ultimately only one Terminator appeared in the film.[12] The liquid metal Terminator would be revisited with the T-1000 character in the 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[13] | Gale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman's assistant, showed interest in the film project.[15] Cameron sold the rights for The Terminator to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. As a producer, Hurd had suggested edits to the script and took a screen writing credit in the film. Cameron has stated that Hurd \"did no actual writing at all\".[14] Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Roger Corman previously and who were now working at Orion Pictures, now part of MGM. Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly at Hemdale Pictures.[16] | Cameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.[16] Henriksen showed up at the office kicking open the door wearing a leather jacket, and had gold foil smothered on his teeth and fake cuts on his face and then sat in a chair.[16] Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film.[16] In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion.[16][17] The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million.[18] | The Italian film The Mechanical Man (1921) contains a scene in which the mechanical man breaks through an armored door and through the hole extends his hand to unlock the latch that closes the inside; this influenced The Terminator, with a substantially identical scene.[19] | Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator, on the other hand, shouldn't have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely.[20] | One of Cameron's first tasks was to find someone to play Kyle Reese. Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion's co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator.[17] Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone was originally offered the role of the Terminator. He turned it down. Mel Gibson was then offered the role, but he also turned it down.[21] The studio then suggested O. J. Simpson for the role of the Terminator, but Cameron did not feel that Simpson would be believable as a killer.[22][23] Cameron still agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him. Cameron planned to pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role.[24] | Upon meeting with Schwarzenegger, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger who would talk about how the villain should be played. Cameron began sketching his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still.[23] After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that \"he'd make a hell of a Terminator\".[25] Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, \"Oh some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.\"[26] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough so that it wouldn't be a risk to his career if it were unsuccessful, also admitting that \"it took [him] awhile to figure out that Jim [Cameron] was the real deal\" (i.e. a director as talented as Spielberg, Hitchcock or Coppola). In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.[25] Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and less than 100 words. James Cameron said that \"Somehow, even his [Austrian] accent worked ... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out.\"[27] | For the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting.[28] Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his \"feelings about the project changed\".[28] Hurd stated that \"almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between [Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese]. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.\"[29] | In the first few pages of the script, the character of Sarah Connor is written as \"19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.\"[30] For the role, Cameron chose Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming Children of the Corn.[31] Rosanna Arquette had previously auditioned.[32] Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Detective Hal Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film.[33] For the special effects shots in the film, Cameron wanted Dick Smith who had previously worked on The Godfather and Taxi Driver. Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston for the job.[34] Brad Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency where a new agent named Beth Donahue found that Cameron was working on The Terminator and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music.[35] Fiedel was then invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd.[35] Hurd was not certain on having Fiedel compose the score as he had only worked in television music previously, and not theatrical films.[35] Fiedel convinced the two that he would be right for the job by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that \"You know, I'm going to play this for him, because it’s really dark and I think it’s interesting for him.\" The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to sign him on to the film.[35] | Filming for The Terminator was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto. Production was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming Conan the Destroyer. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for Rambo: First Blood Part II. He also used this time to refine parts of The Terminator's script and meet with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to Alien.[33][36] | There was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron turned down, and the second was to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted.[37] On creating the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed their sketches back and forth. They eventually decided on a design that was nearly identical to the original one Cameron drew in Rome.[34][38] Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a puppet of the Terminator. It was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.[38] | Both the sequences in 2029 and stop motion scenes in the film were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Junior.[39] A stop motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away. This limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.[40][41] | One of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Hardballer Longslide modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; because of the high power requirement, the helium-neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Arnold Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.[42] | In March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.[38][43] Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that \"the movie took on a larger than life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\"[44][45] Most of The Terminator's action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.[46] | Schwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line \"I'll be back\" changed because of language barriers. In an October 1, 2012, interview on Good Morning America, he revealed that he had difficulty pronouncing the word I'll properly. The actor also felt that his robotic character wouldn't speak in contractions and felt that the Terminator would be more declarative. Schwarzenegger asked James Cameron if he could change the line to: \"I will be back\", but Cameron refused. As a result, Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous subsequent films throughout his career.[47] | After production finished on The Terminator, some post-production shots were needed.[48] These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.[22][43][48] The film's soundtrack was synthesizer music composed by Brad Fiedel.[49] Fiedel described the film's music as being about \"a mechanical man and his heartbeat\".[50] Almost all the music in the film was performed live.[15][50] The Terminator's theme is played over the opening credits and is played in various points in the film in sped up versions: a slowed down version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.[51] Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a \"heroic moment\". Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.[50] The soundtrack to the film was released in 1984.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Cameron","m_produced_by":"Gale Anne Hurd","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Arnold Schwarzenegger | Michael Biehn | Linda Hamilton | Paul Winfield","m_music_by":"Brad Fiedel","m_cinematography":"Adam Greenberg","m_edited_by":"Mark Goldblatt","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 26, 1984 (1984-10-26) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"107 minutes[2]","m_country":"United States[1][3]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$6.4 million[4]","m_box_office":"$78.3 million[4] | The Terminator is a 1984 American science fiction action-thriller film directed by James Cameron, written by Cameron and the film's producer Gale Anne Hurd, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. It was filmed in Los Angeles, produced by Hemdale Film Corporation and distributed by Orion Pictures. Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, played by Hamilton, whose son will one day become a savior against machines in a post-apocalyptic future. Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future sent back in time to protect her. | Though not expected to be a critical or commercial success, The Terminator topped the American box office for two weeks and helped launch the film career of Cameron and solidify that of Schwarzenegger. The film received critical acclaim, with many praising its pacing and action scenes, and Schwarzenegger's role. Its success led to a franchise, consisting of four sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games. | In 2008, The Terminator was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the American National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Petley, Julian (1985). \"The Terminator\".
