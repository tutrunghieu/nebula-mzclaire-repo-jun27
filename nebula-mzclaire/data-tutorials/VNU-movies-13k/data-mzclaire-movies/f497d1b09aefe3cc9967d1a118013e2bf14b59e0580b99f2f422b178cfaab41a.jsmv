{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Phillip is a naive nobody with an uncanny knack for winning in a casino. Not much caring if he wins or loses, Phillip goes on a weeks-long hot streak in Las Vegas that ultimately comes to the attention of a lot of people who want his money. | Lusting after it most is Louise, a lounge singer and con artist who seduces Phillip in the Liberace museum, then lies to him that she is $150,000 in debt from medical and funeral expenses for her parents. | Her ex-husband Wolf wants a piece of the action as well. He just happens to be Phillip's brother, and is lugging around the corpse of their own dead father. Louise's current boyfriend Jack is another interested party, as is a loan shark, Kingman, and a mob hit man, Joey, who's perfectly willing to shoot innocent bystanders in the casino if it'll get him what he wants. Phillip seems helpless against them, but there may be more to him than meets the eye.","m_cast":"Rebecca De Mornay as Louise | Vincent D'Onofrio as Phillip | Richard Edson as Frankie | Delroy Lindo as Kingman | Michael Madsen as Wolf | Billy Bob Thornton as Jack | Frank Whaley as Joey","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"play \"A Darker Purpose\" by Wendy Riss","m_directed_by":"Alex Cox","m_produced_by":"Ken Schwenker","m_screenplay_by":"Wendy Riss","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Rebecca De Mornay Vincent D'Onofrio Richard Edson Michael Madsen Billy Bob Thornton","m_music_by":"Daniel Licht","m_cinematography":"Denis Maloney","m_edited_by":"Carlos Puente","m_production_company":"MDP Worldwide Village Roadshow Pictures-Clipsal Films Partnership","m_distributed_by":"Live Entertainment (USA) Film Four Distributors (UK)","m_release_dates":"July 25, 1997","m_running_time":"92 Minutes","m_country":"United States Australia","m_language":"English | The Winner is a 1996 film, directed by Alex Cox.
