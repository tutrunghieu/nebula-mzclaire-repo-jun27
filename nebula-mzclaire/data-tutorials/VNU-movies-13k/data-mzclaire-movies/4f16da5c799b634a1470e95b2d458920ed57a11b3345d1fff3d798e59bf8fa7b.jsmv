The play's main character is Prospero, and Taymor changed the character's gender to cast Helen Mirren as Prospera.[2] Taymor explained the casting decision, \"I didn't really have a male actor that excited me in mind, and yet there had been a couple of phenomenal females – Helen Mirren being one of them – who [made me think]: 'My God, does this play change? What happens if you make that role into a female role?'\" Taymor held a reading and found that the story could accommodate the change of gender without being gimmicky.[3] | In Shakespeare's play, Prospero was the Duke of Milan. In the adaptation, Prospera is the wife of the Duke. She is \"more overtly wronged\" than Prospero; when the duke dies, Prospera's brother Antonio (played by Chris Cooper) accuses her of killing him with witchcraft. Antonio makes the accusation to be rid of Prospera and claim her royal title. Taymor said, \"She had her whole life taken away from her because she was a woman.\" Prospera wants to prevent the same thing from happening to her daughter.[4] | Principal photography took place around volcanic areas of the big island of Hawaii and Lanai.[4][5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Tempest  by William Shakespeare","m_directed_by":"Julie Taymor","m_produced_by":"Julie Taymor Robert Chartoff Lynn Hendee Julia Taylor-Stanley Jason K.
