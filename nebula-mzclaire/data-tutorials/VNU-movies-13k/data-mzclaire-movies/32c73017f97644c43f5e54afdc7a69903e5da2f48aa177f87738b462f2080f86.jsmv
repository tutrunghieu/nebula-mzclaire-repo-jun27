{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"As told through interviews and footages used through the film, Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program which is broadcast live around the clock and across the globe. His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven, Florida, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, otherwise going about their life to present the illusion to Truman. Creator and executive producer Christof wanted to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations, creating the show around this. | The producers have discouraged Truman from wanting to travel beyond Seahaven by instilling him with aquaphobia through the \"death\" of his father in a boating accident, and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. Despite Christof's controls, Truman manages to act in unexpected ways. During his college years, Truman was set to fall in love and marry Meryl, but another actress, Sylvia, caught his eye. Sylvia manages to bring Truman out of the sight of cameras long enough to warn him that he is on a show before she is taken away and off-set, with the actor playing her father claiming they are returning to Fiji. Since then, while Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to fantasize about Sylvia, using scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia became part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that believe that Truman is being held prisoner by Christof and demand the end of the show. | The film's present begins during the thirtieth year of the show. Truman notices aspects of his life seems too perfect, and odd events all seem centered on him. One day, while going to work, Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back in on set, but the other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure Truman, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent emergencies created by Christof. Meryl begins to break down from the stress, and during one argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off the show. Truman, depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show proper, hoping to bring Truman back to some emotional stability. | Truman seems to recover, but one night, the producers find Truman sleeping in his home's basement. They send Marlon to check on Truman, only to find Truman has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon discovers this on camera, breaking character, and Christof orders their transmission halted while they launch a city-wide search for Truman. Audiences around the world are drawn to this sudden change. They find Truman sailing out on Seahaven's water despite his fear, and Christof restarts the broadcast as he sends a man-made storm to try to capsize the boat. Christof's bosses fear that they may be witnessing the murder of a human being on live television and warn Christof to stop. Truman manages to hang on, calling out to the skies if that is the best they can do. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm. | Truman continues to sail until his boat punctures the wall of the dome, to his surprise. Exploring the wall, he finds an exit door. Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay. Truman considers this, then says his catchphrase, \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night\", takes a bow, and leaves via the door. The audiences celebrate, and Sylvia races to go meet Truman. Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time, and audiences now start looking for something else to watch.","m_cast":"Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies and the first child to be legally adopted by a corporation, he is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. Robin Williams was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective because Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin.[5] Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles.[6] Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do The Truman Show for $12 million.[7] Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's improvisational skills, and the two became more interactive.[5] The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.[8] | Laura Linney as Hannah Gill playing Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on product placement for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased,\" one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is essentially to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney explains that Gill \"was a child actress who never made it, and now she's really ambitious. Mostly she's into negotiating her contract. Every time she sleeps with Truman she gets an extra $10,000.\"[5] Linney heavily studied Sears catalogs from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.[9] | Ed Harris as Christof: The creator of The Truman Show. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax/resolution, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. Dennis Hopper was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences.\" Harris was a last-minute replacement.[7] A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.[8] Harris had an idea of making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.[5] | Noah Emmerich as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a vending machine operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"[5] His name is an amalgam of two jazz musicians, Louis Armstrong and John Coltrane, and in one scene he plays trumpet.[10] | Natascha McElhone as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against The Truman Show, urging Christof to release its lead. | Brian Delate as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia. | Holland Taylor as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children. | Harry Shearer (cameo appearance) as Mike Michaelson (news anchor): Michaelson hosts TruTalk, an entertainment-news program about The Truman Show that broadcasts early in the morning. | Paul Giamatti as Simeon (control room director). | Peter Krause as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to Fiji. | Philip Glass, who composed and performed some of the film's soundtrack, makes a cameo appearance as the incidental keyboard player.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Andrew Niccol completed a one-page film treatment titled The Malcolm Show in May 1991.[11] The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City.[9] Niccol stated, \"I think everyone questions the authenticity of their lives at certain points. It's like when kids ask if they're adopted.\"[12] In the fall of 1993,[13] producer Scott Rudin purchased the script for slightly over $1 million.[14] Paramount Pictures instantly agreed to distribute. Part of the deal called for Niccol to have his directing debut, though Paramount felt the estimated $80 million budget would be too high for him.[15] In addition, Paramount wanted to go with an A-list director, paying Niccol extra money \"to step aside.\" Brian De Palma was under negotiations to direct before he left United Talent Agency in March 1994.[13] Directors who were considered after De Palma's departure included Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg before Peter Weir signed on in early 1995,[5] following a recommendation of Niccol.[12] Bryan Singer wanted to direct but Paramount decided to go with the more experienced Weir.[16] | Paramount was cautious about The Truman Show which they dubbed \"the most expensive art film ever made\" because of its $60 million budget. They wanted the film to be funnier and less dramatic.[5] Weir also shared this vision, feeling that Niccol's script was too dark, and declaring \"where he [Niccol] had it depressing, I could make it light. It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star,[9] but because of commitments with The Cable Guy and Liar Liar, he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year.[5] Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role.[9] Niccol rewrote the script twelve times,[5] while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.[9] | Weir scouted locations in Eastern Florida but was unsatisfied with the landscapes. Sound stages at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to Seaside, Florida, a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place. Other scenes were shot at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California.[8] Norman Rockwell paintings and 1960s postcards were used as inspiration for the film's design.[17][18] Weir, Peter Biziou and Dennis Gassner researched surveillance techniques for certain shots.[17] | The overall look was influenced by television images, particularly commercials: Many shots have characters leaning into the lens with their eyeballs wide open, and the interior scenes are heavily lit, because Weir wanted to remind viewers that \"in this world, everything was for sale.\"[17] Those involved in visual effects work found the film somewhat difficult to make, because 1997 was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to computer-generated imagery.[18] CGI was used to create the upper halves of some of the larger buildings in the film's downtown set. Craig Barron, one of the effects supervisors, said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town, although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings.[19]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Peter Weir","m_produced_by":"Scott Rudin | Andrew Niccol | Edward S.

Feldman, and Adam Schroeder, and written by Niccol. | The film stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, an orphan raised by a corporation inside a simulated television show revolving around his life, until he knows and decides to escape; additional roles are provided by Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, and Ed Harris. | The Truman Show was originally a spec script by Niccol, inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone called \"Special Service\".[4] Unlike the finished product, it was more of a science-fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million—$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rushingly rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle. | The film was a financial success and debuted to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards and The Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as a thesis on Christianity, metaphilosophy, simulated reality, existentialism and reality television. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Truman Show\".
