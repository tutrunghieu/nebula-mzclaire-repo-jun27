{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"David Graham, a recovering alcoholic, returns to England with only 24 hours to save his son, Alec, from hanging for the murder of Alec's girlfriend, Jenny Cole. A neglectful, absentee father who has missed the entire trial while he was in rehab in Canada, Graham discovers his son, awaiting execution, at first refuses to even see him and when he does, to evince any hope for his case, let alone affection for his father. | His sobriety in constant jeopardy, Graham, for all his failings, never for a moment doubts his son's innocence, and begins a frantic last-minute effort to find the evidence that will save his son's life, if not redeem himself as a father. With the help of his son's steadfast lawyer, Graham desperately, and often bungling, investigates the circumstances surrounding the girl's murder, visiting first her furious sister who's onstage in a chorus line, then the home of wealthy car magnate Robert Stanford, where the girlfriend was killed and whose family have been the only real support his son has ever known. Graham ricochets between potential allies, foes and new leads in order to learn who the real murderer could be, including Stanford's beautiful young wife, Honor, his even-younger secretary, Vickie Harker, and his adopted son, and Alec's best friend Brian, who allows Graham to see what his own misspent life looked like through his son's eyes. | With the Home Office on standby to receive any overwhelming evidence proving Alec's innocence, Graham is forced to extreme measures to try to establish the real killer's guilt.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Someone Waiting (play)  by Emlyn Williams","m_directed_by":"Joseph Losey","m_produced_by":"John Arnold | Anthony Simmons","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Redgrave | Ann Todd | Leo McKern","m_music_by":"Tristram Cary","m_cinematography":"Freddie Francis","m_edited_by":"Alan Osbiston","m_production_company":"Harlequin Productions","m_distributed_by":"Astor Pictures","m_release_dates":"March 1957","m_running_time":"85 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | Time Without Pity is a 1957 British film noir thriller about a father trying to save his son from execution for murder. | Directed by expatriate American Joseph Losey, after he was blacklisted in America due to McCarthyism, Time Without Pity was his second film in Britain and his first under his own name.[1] The film stars Michael Redgrave, Ann Todd, and Leo McKern.
