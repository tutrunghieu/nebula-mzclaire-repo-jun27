{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the last two days of 1999, Los Angeles has become a dangerous war zone. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a SQUID, an illegal electronic device that records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, and when played back through a MiniDisc-like device, allows a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations. Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, agrees to buy the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD police officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman as she flees to the subway. Iris manages to escape on a rapid transit after her wig is pulled off by Engleman, revealing a SQUID recorder headset. | Lenny pines for Faith and relies on his two best friends, bodyguard and limousine driver Lornette \"Mace\" Mason and private investigator Max Peltier, for emotional support. Mace has unrequited feelings for Lenny from the past, from when he was still a cop and stepped in as a dependable father figure for her son after her boyfriend was arrested on drug charges, but disapproves of his SQUID-dealing business. While Lenny and Max are drinking together at a bar, Iris drops a SQUID disc through the sunroof of Lenny's car and flees when she sees police nearby. However, his car is towed away before he can find it. He then calls Mace to pick him up. While in the car with Mace, Lenny and one of her clients discuss the latest technology associated with SQUID recordings. Their conversation angers Mace, who tells him she does not like him dealing in her car. Nevertheless, she eventually agrees to take them to a nightclub where Faith is going to sing. | In the club, Lenny first meets with another contact, who gives him a SQUID disc that was left for him, and then tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, music industry mogul Philo Gant, but to no avail. Lenny is picked up by Mace again and plays the disc the contact gave him. In the playback, Lenny watches that Iris is being brutally raped and murdered by an attacker at the Sunset Regent hotel. He panics and tells Mace to take him to the hotel immediately. When they arrive, Iris is being taken out on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take the disc to Tick, who tries to identify the equipment in the recording but cannot tell if it is his. Tick also recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny, leading Mace to surmise that she probably left something in Lenny's car. | Mace and Lenny go to the impound lot and find the disc that Iris left in his car. As they leave, Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint. Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left. Mace takes Lenny to her brother's house and watches Iris' disc. The two discover that her death is tied to a cover-up of the murder of rapper Jeriko One by Steckler and Engleman, who disapprove his politically-charged music. Lenny, Mace, and Max also learn that Tick has been rendered brain-dead from forcefully being exposed to highly amplified SQUID signals. Lenny concludes that the assault on Tick was committed by the same person who killed Iris and fears Faith will be next. Lenny and Mace confront Faith about the truth behind Jeriko's death, and Faith tells them that Philo hired Iris to spy on him. | As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private party at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel that Philo is hosting for the city's wealthy elite. Lenny gives Iris' disc to Mace so that she can deliver it to deputy police commissioner Palmer Strickland. Upon entering Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds another SQUID disc and Philo's body on the floor, whose brain has been damaged in the same manner as Tick's. After watching the disc, Lenny discovers that Max and Faith have become lovers and that they forced Philo to run an amplified recording of them having sex. Max and Faith then enter the room, explaining that they set Philo up because he wanted to have Faith killed for what she knew about Jeriko's death, and that he now intends to frame Lenny for Philo's murder. Max aims his pistol at Lenny, but Faith, not wanting to see Lenny be killed, stops him. After a hand to hand fight, Lenny throws Max off the balcony to his death. | Outside on the street, Mace is pursued by Steckler and Engelman. She manages to subdue both of them, cuffing them to a scaffold, only for other nearby police officers to attack her, triggering a riot in the crowd. Strickland appears and restores order, ordering the two officers to be arrested. In the ensuing confrontation, Engelman grabs a pistol from one of the officers and shoots himself, while Steckler is gunned down by the police when he tries to shoot Mace. Faith is arrested for Philo's murder. Lenny finds Mace and the two share a passionate kiss as the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century around them.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The story of Strange Days was originally conceived by director James Cameron around 1986.[1] He eventually presented it to his former wife and director Kathryn Bigelow, who immediately found it impressive.[2] According to her, \"These two characters on the eve of the millennium, with one character trying to get the woman who loves him to help him save the woman he loves. It's this great emotional matrix.\"[2] After a series of dialogues, Cameron and Bigelow developed the film's society and political element. Cameron focused more on the romantic side, while Bigelow centered more on \"the edginess, the grit\" part of the film, which was something she was always interested in.[2] Cameron later wrote a 90-page treatment based on these dialogues,[3] stating that \"It was practically a novel, but it was unwieldy; it needed structure.\"[1] The treatment was then presented to screenwriter Jay Cocks, who turned it into a script.[1] Cameron felt that the resulting script was very well structured and only did a dialogue polish on top of it.[1] | Bigelow was motivated to start work on Strange Days shortly after a series of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict.[4] Referring to the latter, she noted, \"I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live.\"[5] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make \"valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression.\"[4] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.[6] | Although the script for Strange Days was completed in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994.[6] Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidade to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant.[6] Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads.[6] Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role \"required somebody who had a tremendous amount of intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply.\"[6] Cameron, however, felt that a \"glibber and slicker\" actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny \"a sexier character—a guy you can care about very much.\"[6] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning.[7] The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.[6] | The shooting for Strange Days was originally intended to start on May 12, 1994, but was delayed to June 6, 1994 because the full cast list was incomplete.[6] Bigelow said that the O. J. Simpson murder case \"[echoed] the film events\", adding that Strange Days was filmed during the Summer and Fall of that year.[8] The film was entirely shot in the Greater Los Angeles Area over a period of 77 nights.[6][7] Producer Steven-Charles Jaffe said that the city was generally very cooperative, except for the subway scene as the team only had four hours a night to film it.[7] Jaffe, however, remarked that Bigelow \"was so well prepared that what would have taken another director several weeks to do, she did in a matter of days.\"[7] The production team also received permission from the West Hollywood film commission to film on Sunset Boulevard for a two-day period, which required the shut down of several lanes of traffic.[6] | The scene where the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century at the end of the film was shot at the corner of the 5th and Flower streets, between the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and the Los Angeles Public Library.[9] Over 50 off-duty police officers were hired to control an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, who had to pay $10 in advance to attend the event.[6][9] The film-makers also hired rave promoters Moss Jacobs and Philip Blaine to produce performances featuring Aphex Twin, Deee-Lite, and other cyber-techno bands.[6] It was reported that a total of $750,000 was spent on the event, and half of the 1,300 rooms in the Bonaventure were rented out.[9] The event started at 9 p.m. on a Saturday night and ended shortly before its scheduled end at 4 a.m., as five people were hospitalized for suffering overdoses of the hallucinogenic drug Ecstasy.[6][9] | The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.[6] A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce the effect of looking through someone else's eyes.[6] Bigelow revealed that it was essentially \"a stripped-down Arri that weighed much less than the smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses.\"[10] Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance.[6] The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a safety harness, took two years to co-ordinate.[6] According to Cameron, \"It's a major set piece. For the jump alone, we built special cameras, special rigs. We designed transitions that would work seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn't look technical.\"[1] | International music was chosen as the primary music style of Strange Days due to its veriety of sounds and instruments.[6] According to music supervisor Randy Gerston, who previously worked on True Lies, this type of music helped the film-makers create a futuristic atmosphere, noting that \"the world is shrinking and people are getting acclimated to strange languages being part of the pop vernacular.\"[6] Musicians featured on the soundtrack also included French duo Deep Forest, British trip hop artist Tricky, and British alternative rock band Skunk Anansie.[6] The latter was encouraged to jam between takes at the film's New Year event so that Bigelow could record them live and give the rave a greater authenticity. Although the band would have a live sound on the film, they ultimately had to lip-sync.[6] A soundtrack album was released shortly before the film's opening.[11] In addition, 60,000 promotional CD-ROMs, which contained production material from the film and music clips from the soundtrack, was made available only through the \"College Special\" issue of Rolling Stone magazine that was sold at record stores.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Kathryn Bigelow","m_produced_by":"James Cameron Steven-Charles Jaffe","m_screenplay_by":"James Cameron Jay Cocks","m_story_by":"James Cameron","m_starring":"Ralph Fiennes Angela Bassett Juliette Lewis Tom Sizemore Vincent D'Onofrio Michael Wincott William Fichtner","m_music_by":"Graeme Revell","m_cinematography":"Matthew F.

It stars Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, and Tom Sizemore. Set in the last two days of 1999, the film follows the story of a black marketeer of SQUID discs, recordings that allow a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations, as he attempts to uncover the truth behind the murder of a prostitute. | Blending science fiction with film noir conventions, Strange Days explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape, and voyeurism.

The film was entirely shot in the Greater Los Angeles Area over a period of 77 nights. The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. | Strange Days was a commercial failure and almost derailed Bigelow's career, making little more than a sixth of its $42 million production cost. Upon release, the film polarized film critics; some reviewers praised its gritty atmosphere and the performances by Fiennes and Bassett, while others criticized it for failing to commentate its violence. Nevertheless, the film's critical standing has improved over the years, with many fans feeling that the film has been overlooked by a casual mass audience and misguided critics. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e James Cameron; Brent Dunham (2012).
