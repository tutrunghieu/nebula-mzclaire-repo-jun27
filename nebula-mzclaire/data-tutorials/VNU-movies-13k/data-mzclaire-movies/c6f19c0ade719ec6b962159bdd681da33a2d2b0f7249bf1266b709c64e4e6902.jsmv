The models were styled upon the Crowley Maritime Corporation, founded in San Francisco in 1892.[11] They are led by Captain Star, who narrates the series. The fleet consists of Ten Cents, Big Mac, O.J., Top Hat, Warrior, Hercules and Sunshine. | Another tugboat, Boomer, is briefly a member of the Star Fleet after being found floating at sea. Boomer believes himself to be jinxed, and he certainly seems to bring trouble with him wherever he goes. After numerous nasty accidents, Captain Star sells Boomer, who is later made into a houseboat. It is unknown whether he remains part of the fleet after this. The adventures of Boomer are central to the episode \"Jinxed\". Grampus, a naval submarine who appears throughout the series, is purchased from the Navy by Captain Star to work for the Star Fleet. It is also unknown whether this remains after the conclusion of the series. | The Z-Stacks are the show's antagonists, who are frequently seen trying to sabotage the good work of the Star Fleet. They take on the more risky contracts in the port, at the attraction of a higher pay. The models' design was taken from the Moran Tugs of New York City.[11] They are led by Captain Zero. The fleet consists of Zorran, Zebedee, Zak, Zug and Zip. As with the Star Fleet, Boomer also briefly worked for the Z-Stacks after being sold by the former. Despite this, Boomer was also cast out the Z-Stacks after his explosives barge spontaneously detonated.[12][13]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Shepperton Studios, Surrey, England, United Kingdom","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"13 (list of episodes)","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"multi-camera","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":"Thomas & Friends Salty's Lighthouse Theodore Tugboat | Tugs (stylized as TUGS) is a British children's television series first broadcast in 1988. It was created by the producers of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, Robert D.

Following the initial airing of the series throughout 1989, television rights were sold to an unknown party, while all models and sets from the series sold to Britt Allcroft. Modified set props and tugboat models were used in Thomas & Friends from 1991 onwards, with footage from the original program being heavily dubbed and edited for use in the American children's series Salty's Lighthouse. | Mitton returned to working with Thomas & Friends in 1991, while Cardona would go on to direct Theodore Tugboat, a similarly natured animated series set in Canada.[4] All thirteen episodes of the show were released on VHS between 1988 and 1993. |  | ","m_country":null,"m_language":null,"m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Mitton, David (director) (1989). \"Sunshine\"/\"Pirate\" (Videotape).
