{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Gino, a humble shoe-shiner in Chicago, is approached by a Mafia don who offers him a large sum of money to take the rap for a murder committed by another gangster. Gino agrees, planning to buy a fishing boat with the money he will earn after a three-year sentence. | While preparing for his court confession, Gino is watched over by Jerry, a bottom-rung gangster who has recently gotten into trouble for failing to follow orders. During a short and boring stay at a local hotel, Jerry decides to give Gino one last weekend to remember in Lake Tahoe before he goes to prison. | After arriving at the resort and casino, Jerry's tall tales and Gino's quiet dignity quickly get Gino mistaken for a wealthy and powerful mafioso, leading to complications for both men. He is summoned to the Nevada home of crime boss Vincenzo, where a frantic Jerry is certain that his ruse will lead to grave consequences. Vincenzo takes a liking to Gino, however, and the two elderly men bond. | Narrowly escaping after the Chicago don turns up at Vincenzo's home, a relieved Jerry manages to get Gino back to Chicago safely. On the day Gino is to confess in court, however, Jerry discovers that his superiors were merely stalling for time. Gino is to be killed, and Jerry is to be the one who does the killing.","m_cast":"Don Ameche as Gino | Joe Mantegna as Jerry | Robert Prosky as Joseph Vincenzo | Ricky Jay as Silver | Mike Nussbaum as Green | J.
