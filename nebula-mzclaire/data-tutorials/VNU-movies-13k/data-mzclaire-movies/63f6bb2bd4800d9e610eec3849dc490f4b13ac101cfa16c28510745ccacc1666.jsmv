The film stars Mickey Rooney as Hart and Tom Drake as Rodgers, along with Janet Leigh, Betty Garrett, Ann Sothern and numerous musical stars. | The movie is best remembered for featuring the final screen pairing between Rooney and Judy Garland, and for the lavish showcasing of the Rodgers and Hart catalogue of songs. The script, as in many such films, was heavily fictionalized. It sanitized Hart's complex psychological problems and self-destructive behavior, which led to the break-up of the writing partnership and contributed to Hart's early death. Further, while understandable for its time, the film also completely avoided any mention of Hart's homosexuality. | The beginning of the film is somewhat unusual for a biopic.[citation needed] Drake appears alone in character, introducing himself to the audience as Richard Rodgers and then introducing the story. It's as if Rodgers were playing himself. | Though the film performed very well at the box office, it proved to be quite an expensive production and, as a result, barely recouped its cost in its first release.[2] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c The Eddie Mannix Ledger, Los Angeles: Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study . | ^ H.
