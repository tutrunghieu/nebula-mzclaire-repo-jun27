{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Three thousand years ago, an Aztec warlord named Yaotl and his four generals discover a portal opening into a parallel universe which is said to have great power. Yaotl becomes immortal but at a high price, as his four generals were turned to stone. The portal releases thirteen immortal monsters that destroy his army as well as his enemies. In the present, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have grown apart. After defeating the Shredder, Master Splinter has sent Leonardo to Central America for training. Donatello works as an IT specialist, Michelangelo works as a birthday party entertainer called Cowabunga Carl and Raphael works at night as a vigilante nicknamed Nightwatcher. April O'Neil operates a company that locates and acquires relics for collectors with the help of her boyfriend, Casey Jones. | During a business trip to Central America, April runs into Leonardo and tells him that the turtles have drifted apart. She returns to New York with four statues for her client, Max Winters, the richest man in the city. Upon arrival she calls Casey and tells him that she spoke to Leo and tells him that Leo's not coming back. However a little later Leo does return, and April and Casey deliver the statues to Winters. Winters hires Karai and the Foot Clan to search the city for the thirteen beasts before the portal opens again. Raphael encounters Casey, who reveals his knowledge of Raphael's double identity and joins him in hunting criminals. | Winters, who is actually the still-immortal Yaotl, reanimates his generals with his company's advanced technology, but they remain made of stone. Leo returns to the sewer, meeting Splinter. Splinter forbids the Turtles from fighting until they can act as a team again. While training, the Turtles encounter one of the thirteen beasts, Bigfoot, battling the Foot Clan. The Turtles engage Bigfoot, going against Leo and Splinter's orders. | Eventually, the Generals and the Foot Clan captured Bigfoot. When Raphael visits Casey, they encounter the Vampire Succubor and witness her capture by the Foot Clan and the Stone Generals, who spot them and knock Raphael unconscious. Casey takes him back to the apartment while April calls the Turtles for help and reveals the identities of Yaotl and his Generals. After being revived, Raphael suggests they pursue Yaotl, but Leo forbids him to go until Splinter gives out the order and so Raphael goes out to investigate alone as Nightwatcher. | Leo, Donny and Mikey return to their sewer home to plan their next move, where Donny discovers the reopening of the portal will be directly over Winters' skyscraper headquarters. Splinter informs Leo that his team is incomplete, and that he knows what he must do. After eleven monsters have been captured, General Aguila questions Yaotl's actions. The Generals conspire against Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. | Raphael encounters one of the remaining monsters, the Jersey Devil, at a diner, but drives him off. Leo has been following him, wanting to put an end to the Nightwatcher's vigilante acts, but when Raph is revealed, they battle. Raph breaks Leo's twin swords and seems as though he is about to kill him - but then realises the terrible act he was about to commit, and flees. Immediately after Raph leaves, the Generals ambush Leo, who is shot with a poison dart and too weak to fight them. Raph hears him scream in the distance as he's taken hostage and doubles back in pursuit, but he fails to get there in time. He takes Leo's broken sabers back to Splinter and explains what happened. | The Generals intend to substitute Leo for the thirteenth missing beast and Raphael decides to make amends for his reckless mistakes by rescuing Leo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his Generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: He wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The Generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer Earth under their command. | Having refused to betray Yaotl in exchange for serving the Generals, April, Casey and the Foot Clan work together, searching for the final monster while the Turtles fight the Generals. Splinter and Yaotl fight off winged portal monsters emerging from the portal. April, Casey and Karai arrive at the tower with the Sea Monster. The Sea Monster crashes into the Generals, dragging them into the portal before it closes for another three thousand years. Karai then warns the gang to enjoy their victory while it lasts, claiming they will soon contend with a familiar face from their past. She and the rest of the Foot Clan depart via smoke bombs. Yaotl, now mortal, honors the Turtles and Splinter, thanking them with his dying breath for fulfilling his lifelong wish. Splinter places Winter's helmet among his collection of various keepsakes (items seen in the previous three films such as the time scepter and the ooze canister), as well as Raphael's Nightwatcher helmet and Michelangelo's turtle costume. The movie ends with Raphael narrating that the Turtles will always be brothers as the four of them jump across the rooftops of New York.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"TMNT ranked number one at the box office on its opening weekend, beating 300 (the top film of the previous two weeks), The Last Mimzy, Shooter, Pride, The Hills Have Eyes 2, and Reign Over Me. Weekend estimates showed that the film made $25.45 million over the weekend of March 23–25, 2007.[30] The film grossed over $95 million worldwide, including over $54 million domestically during its 91-day run in the 3,120 North American theaters.[4] |  | TMNT has a 34% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 115 reviews with an average rating of 5/10, and the consensus being \"TMNT's art direction is splendid, but the plot is non-existent and the dialogue lacks the irony and goofy wit of the earlier TMNT movies.\"[31] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score from film critics, calculated an average rating score of 41 out of 100 based on 21 reviews.[32] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave a negative review, stating that the film \"is trying for a new image. But it takes more than an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue.\"[33] Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously.\"[34] Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called the film \"a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message — family, family, family — is the processed cream filling\".[35] Conversely, Todd Gilchrist of IGN gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a fun, action-filled adventure that will satisfy longtime fans and generate a legion of new ones, whether it be by virtue of simple storytelling, solid CGI, carefully-choreographed action, or just the spirit and energy that only the Turtles can create.\"[36] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post felt that the film \"is technically superb and quite enjoyable as long as you don't bang your head against the plot, which will cause hot flashes, premature aging and fallen arches.\"[37] According to Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the film is \"not so dark or scary as to keep most kids away\" and it \"has a cool, noirish sheen. There's an attention to detail in the visuals and sound design that pushes it up several notches above most kiddie fare.\"[38]","m_production":"A computer graphics imagery (CGI) TMNT movie was first announced in 2000, with John Woo supposedly at the helm. That movie languished in development hell and Woo ultimately moved on to other projects.[6] TMNT, executive produced by the TMNT co-creator Peter Laird, is disparate from the previous and subsequent films' live action style as the only CGI film in the franchise to date. Writer/director Kevin Munroe said that he wanted to do total CGI instead of live action and CGI turtles because it would be easier for the audience to \"suspend disbelief for such an offbeat story\" as there would be no break in the reality between CGI and live action.[7] Producer Tom Gray explained that the decision to depart from the live action series was due to escalating budgets for the three films, and with each film making less than its predecessor, a CGI film became a reality.[8] For example, the first film made $135.2 million on a budget of $13.5 million, and the third made $44 million on a budget of $21 million.[8] Orange Sky Golden Harvest's rights to the franchise had expired, and Gray said the question arose there over a CGI TMNT film in 2004.[8] Munroe stated in terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but eventually it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart.[8] When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or \"less Cowabunga\" and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. \"I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!\"[9] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book.[8] Karai was one of Munroe's favorite characters from the comics and he \"was the one who really pushed for Karai\" to appear in the film.[10] Development and pre-production for TMNT began in June 2005[11] at Imagi's Los Angeles facility and the CGI animation was produced in Hong Kong, followed by post-production in Hollywood.[11] In designing the New York backdrop, art director/concept artist Simon Murton stylized the familiar Manhattan skyline and urban landscapes: \"We began with cinematic cues from certain black-and-white films from the 1940s and '50s. I really wanted to push the lighting and the environments to create the look and feel of an alternate reality.\"[12] The animators that worked on the fight sequences were inspired by Hong Kong action films. Animation director Kim Ooi explains said that because of CGI they were able to \"push and stylize beyond the limits of live action.\"[12] Imagi used Maya with Pixar’s RenderMan for the production pipeline’s back-end.[2] Jim Cummings was the only past TMNT actor to appear in this film, where he had previously contributed voice-work in the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. The film also features the two voice actors for Ratchet in the Ratchet & Clank series, Mikey Kelley from the first game, and James Arnold Taylor from the others, playing Michelangelo and Leonardo respectively. TMNT was Mako Iwamatsu's last film before his death. Mako was announced as the voice of Splinter at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2006. He then died the next day.[13] A dedication to Mako appears at the end of the film's credits.[14] Although Iwamatsu is the only actor credited in the role, Greg Baldwin performs a substantial portion of Splinter's dialogue in the finished film; Baldwin had already mimicked Iwamatsu's voice when he took up the late actor's role as Iroh in the concurrently-produced cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender, and used this precedent to successfully lobby to join the cast of TMNT as Splinter following Iwamatsu's death.[15] Talking about a possible sequel to the film, Munroe said: | Shredder – it would be cool to see. I’d love to see us explore the Karai and Foot Ninja thing a little more. I love the Rat King, even though it’s such a ‘one-opp’ villain, but I still think it would be kind of cool to go back to him. [...] I’d love to – and this is sort of the ‘out there’ one, as I don’t think it would work for our next sequel – the idea of the Triceratons. I think that would be really fun – the idea of traveling to that planet or them invading or something. [...] We come up with ideas for Peter [Laird]. ‘Okay, Pete, they time-travel back, and they go to Mayan culture, and they fight aliens, who just happen to be teleporting back at the same time.’ And he’s like, ‘Eh, we did it in 1992.’ Stuff like that. I mean, they’ve been everywhere. There’s so much source material.[16]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  by Kevin Eastman Peter Laird","m_directed_by":"Kevin Munroe","m_produced_by":"Thomas K.
