Out of these she chose five representatives—three black, two white—all marvelously lively, intelligent, and articulate women who recall their experiences with a mixture of pleasant nostalgia and detached bitterness. | The reminiscences are intercut with the realities of the period – old news, films, recruiting trailers, March of Time clips, and pop songs such as “Rosie the Riveter.” These often serve to highlight the disparities between how women were portrayed in wartime media and the actual experiences of these five women. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter - Cast\".
