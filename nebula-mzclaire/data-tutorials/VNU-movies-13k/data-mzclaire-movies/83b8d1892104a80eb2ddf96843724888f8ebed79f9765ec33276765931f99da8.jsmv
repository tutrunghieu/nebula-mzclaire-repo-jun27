{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Planet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has wasted all of its air. Skroob schemes to steal air from the neighboring planet Druidia by kidnapping Princess Vespa, the daughter of King Roland on the day of her pre-arranged wedding to the narcoleptic Prince Valium. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with Spaceball One, an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her Mercedes spaceship with her Droid of Honor, Dot Matrix. | King Roland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his mawg (half-man, half-dog) sidekick, Barf (which is short for \"Barfolomew\"), offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster Pizza the Hutt. In their Winnebago space ship (Eagle 5), Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before Spaceball One, rescue both her and Dot, then escape. Spaceball One tries to follow, but Dark Helmet foolishly orders the ship to \"ludicrous speed,\" causing it to overshoot the escapees, who land on the nearby \"desert moon of Vega.\" The escapees travel on foot in blazing sun and pass out. They are found by The Dinks, a group of red-clad little people, and are taken to a cave occupied by Yogurt, who is old and wise. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to the power of \"The Schwartz.\" Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Lone Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince. | Spaceball One, by breaking the fourth wall (obtaining a VHS copy of the film and fast-forwarding to the part where the heroes crash-land), tracks down Lone Starr, captures Vespa, and returns with her to planet Spaceball. Her captors threaten to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing Roland to give over the code to the shield that protects Druidia (which is \"1-2-3-4-5\"). Dark Helmet takes Spaceball One to Druidia, where he transforms the ship into Mega Maid, a giant robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner that begins sucking the air from the planet. Lone Starr, after training in the Schwartz with Yogurt's help, returns to Druidia, reversing the robot's sucking action to return the air to the planet. | Lone Starr and his allies enter the Mega Maid to attempt to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Dark Helmet with \"Schwartz rings\" (a parody of lightsabers) near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr manages to defeat Dark Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship, while Skroob, Dark Helmet, and Colonel Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time. Trapped in the robot's head as the ship explodes, they land on a nearby planet, much to the regret of its ape population. | With Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut, Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt informing him that he is a prince and thus eligible to marry Vespa. He manages to reach Druidia in time to stop her wedding to Valium, announces his royal lineage, then marries Vespa himself.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":"The possibility of a sequel was satirised in the film itself, with Yogurt's quote: \"God willing, we'll all meet again in Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money\". | In September 2004, news about a sequel, parodying the Star Wars prequel trilogy, appeared online.[17] A follow on to Spaceballs was eventually developed[18][19] into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as Spaceballs: The Animated Series on G4 and the Canadian Super Channel. | Moranis claimed in an interview that he and Brooks had discussed a potential sequel, with Moranis pitching the title Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II. However, Moranis added that he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward.[20] | In February 2015, Brooks said that he would like to make a sequel to be released after the next Star Wars movie and hopes that Rick Moranis would reprise his role from the first film. A sequel with the whole cast is not possible since John Candy, Joan Rivers, Dick Van Patten and Dom DeLuise are all deceased.[21] This proposed film, Brooks said, may be called Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money.[22] | In 1989, the film Martians Go Home was distributed in the Italian market as Balle Spaziali 2 - La vendetta (Balle Spaziali being the localized title of Spaceballs). The film has no connection to Spaceballs.[23]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mel Brooks","m_produced_by":"Mel Brooks","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mel Brooks | John Candy | Rick Moranis | Bill Pullman | Daphne Zuniga | Dick Van Patten | George Wyner | Joan Rivers","m_music_by":"John Morris","m_cinematography":"Nick McLean","m_edited_by":"Conrad Buff IV","m_production_company":"Brooksfilms","m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"June 24, 1987 (1987-06-24) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$22.7 million[1]","m_box_office":"$38.1 million (US)[2] | Spaceballs is a 1987 American parody film co-written and directed by Mel Brooks and starring Brooks, Bill Pullman, John Candy and Rick Moranis.
