He desperately tries to get studio executives interested in his latest project, which he has financed himself, so he decides to throw a huge party at his house and show the film footage to those who come. | The party turns into a loud, alcohol-fueled orgy. Jolly is unable to impress a Hollywood mogul, eager to move on to a more important social engagement, with the outdated humor and pathos of his movie. The more he drinks, the more angry Jolly becomes. The arrival of an underage girl brings out a protective, possibly perverted interest on Jolly's part, while the attention paid to Queenie by the virile young actor Dale Sword ignites a jealous fury in the sad comic that leads to violence and tragedy.","m_cast":"James Coco as Jolly Grimm | Raquel Welch as Queenie | Perry King as Dale Sword | David Dukes as James Morrison | Tiffany Bolling as Kate | Mews Small as Bertha | Royal Dano as Tex | Paul Barresi as the Bartender","m_reception":null,"m_production":"After the film's original release in 1975, other versions varying in length resurfaced on VHS and DVD, as well as a director's cut, 20 minutes longer, briefly released to cinemas in 1981. | Stanzas from the poem that inspired this story are read in a narrative voice-over by actor David Dukes during the film.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Ivory","m_produced_by":"Ismail Merchant","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"James Coco Raquel Welch Perry King Tiffany Bolling Royal Dano David Dukes","m_music_by":"Walter Marks Louis St. Louis (song)","m_cinematography":"Walter Lassally","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"AIP (theatrical cut version) MGM (DVD, directors cut)","m_release_dates":"March 1975","m_running_time":"109 min.
