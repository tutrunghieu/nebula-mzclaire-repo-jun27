{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Arizona, 17-year-old high school students Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) and Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan) race their cars to win the affections of Clay's girlfriend Cindy (Nikki Griffin). When Sean cuts through a structure and catches up to Clay, Clay hits Sean's car repeatedly until they reach a high-speed turn, which causes both cars to crash; Sean's car is totaled. Clay's wealthy family helps him escape punishment, but Sean is sent to live in Tokyo, Japan, with his father, a U.S. Navy officer, in order to avoid juvie or even jail. | While in school, Sean befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow), a military brat who introduces him to the world of drift racing in Japan. Sean has a confrontation with Takashi (Brian Tee)—aka D.K. (Drift King)—over Sean talking to Takashi's girlfriend Neela (Nathalie Kelley). Though forbidden to drive, Sean decides to race against Takashi, who has ties to the Yakuza. He borrows a Nissan Silvia from Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang), now a business partner to Takashi, and loses, totaling the car because of his lack of knowledge of drifting — racing that involves dangerous hairpin turns. | To repay his debt for the car he destroyed, Sean must work for Han. Later on, Han becomes friends with Sean and teaches the young racer how to drift. He also loans him another car for future races. Han explains that he is helping him because he is the only person willing to stand up to Takashi. Sean moves in with Han and soon masters drifting, gaining some repute after defeating DK's right-hand man, Morimoto. Sean soon asks Neela out on a date, and learns that after her mother died she moved in with Takashi's grandmother, resulting in her hooking up with him. Takashi beats up Sean the next day, telling him to stay away from Neela; Neela subsequently leaves Takashi and moves in with Sean and Han. | Takashi's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba) (the head of the Yakuza) reprimands Takashi for allowing Han to steal from him. Takashi and Morimoto confront Han, Sean, and Neela about the thefts. Twinkie causes a distraction, allowing Han, Sean, and Neela to flee, pursued by Takashi and Morimoto. During the chase, Morimoto is killed in a crash, leaving Takashi to pursue Han, Sean, and Neela on his own. Han allows Sean to overtake him in order to hold him off, but the chase ends when Sean and Neela crash. Meanwhile, moments after escaping from Takashi, Han is critically injured when his Veilside Mazda RX-7 is rammed by an oncoming car that catches on fire, and explodes; the explosion kills Han just seconds before Sean has a chance to save him. | Takashi, Sean, and his father become involved in an armed standoff which is resolved by Neela agreeing to leave with Takashi. Twinkie gives his money to Sean to replace the money Han stole, which Sean then returns to Kamata. Sean proposes a race against Takashi to determine who must leave Tokyo. Sean and Han's friends then build a Ford Mustang '67, with a Skyline GT-R RB26DETT engine salvaged from Han's Nissan Silvia, and other spare parts. | That night, on the mountain, crowds gather to see the race; Takashi takes the lead initially, but Sean's training allows him to catch up. Determined to win, Takashi resorts to ramming Sean's car, eventually missing and driving off the mountain while Sean crosses the finish line. Kamata keeps his word and lets Sean remain in Tokyo (In a deleted scene, Kamata has Takashi taken away). | The next night, Sean, the new \"Drift King,\" is challenged by a new driver who knew Han: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel).","m_cast":"Lucas Black as Sean Boswell, a 17-year-old social outcast interested in illegal street racing. | Sung Kang as Han Seoul-Oh, Takashi's friend and business partner (and old friend of Dominic Toretto) who becomes friends with Sean and teaches him how to drift. After gaining his share of the Rio heist and also cleaning his record and losing Gisele, he settles in Tokyo and owns a tuning shop. He works with Takashi mainly since his garage is on the turf of Takashi's uncle Kamata, who is the head of the Yakuza. | Nathalie Kelley as Neela, an Australian who is Takashi's girlfriend, but later on falls for Sean. She is an outsider due, since her mother died when she was ten and she was a hostess. Takashi's family took her in and raised her. She drives a 2004 Mazda RX-8. | Bow Wow as Twinkie. He is Sean's first friend in Tokyo and introduces Sean to the drift world. He drives a 2005 Volkswagen Touran with a Hulk theme. He dislikes racing, instead making a living by selling stolen American goods to classmates and drivers. | Brian Tee as Takashi/DK (Drift King). He is a professional street racer and is crowned as Drift King (or DK). He is respected only because his uncle is the head of the Yakuza. | Leonardo Nam as Morimoto, Takashi's closest friend and right-hand man. He drives a yellow-black 2003 Nissan 350Z. He is a typical high-school bully, and is not very smart. | Brian Goodman as Lieutenant Boswell, Sean's father, a U.S. naval officer stationed in Tokyo. He owns a 1967 Ford Mustang GT, which he is rebuilding in his garage. | Zachery Ty Bryan as Clay, the football quarterback of Sean's school whom Sean challenges for a race. He is a typical rich kid and owns a 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10. | Nikki Griffin as Cindy, Clay's girlfriend, who suggests that Clay and Sean compete to win her affections. | Jason Tobin as Earl, one of Han's friends. | Keiko Kitagawa as Reiko, Earl's friend. | Lynda Boyd as Ms. Boswell, Sean's mother, who, fed up with moving herself and Sean around, sends her son to Tokyo to live with his father. | Sonny Chiba as Kamata, Takashi's uncle. He is the head of the Yakuza who also manages business on his turf. | Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. He is Han's old friend, and arrives in Tokyo when he hears the news of Han's death. His cameo at the end of this film was originally meant to foreshadow his appearance in a chronological sequel, before it was instead decided to set the fourth film before this one.","m_reception":" | Tokyo Drift brought in over $24 million on its opening weekend. The movie itself was in limited release in Japan (released under the name Wild Speed 3). As of January 28, 2007, the domestic box office take totalled $62,514,415 with another $95,953,877 from the foreign box office, resulting in total receipts of $158,468,292.[2] Tokyo Drift grossed lower than its predecessor films. However, it was considered successful enough to justify continuing the series with a fourth film, as long as Vin Diesel returned to the main cast. | The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift gained a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 113 critics, with an average rating of 4.8/10, and the site's consensus reading: \"Eye-popping driving sequences coupled with a limp story and flat performances make this Drift an adequate follow-up to the previous Fast and Furious installments. Strictly for the racing crowd and fans of the first two films.\"[13] On Metacritic, which determines a normalized rating out of 100 from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 46 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics.[14] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film, giving it three out of four stars, saying that director Justin Lin \"takes an established franchise and makes it surprisingly fresh and intriguing,\" adding that Tokyo Drift is \"more observant than we expect\" and that \"the story [is] about something more than fast cars\".[15] Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun felt that \"the opening half-hour may prove to be a disreputable classic of pedal-to-the-metal filmmaking.\"[16] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said that \"it's not much of a movie, but a hell of a ride\".[17] | Michael Medved gave Tokyo Drift one and a half stars out of four, saying: \"There's no discernible plot [...] or emotion or humor.\"[18] James Berardinelli from ReelViews also gave it one and a half stars out of four, saying: \"I expect a racing film to be derivative. That goes with the territory. No one is seeing a Fast and the Furious movie for the plot. When it comes to eye candy, the film is on solid ground—it offers plenty of babes and cars (with the latter being more lovingly photographed than the former). However, it is unacceptable that the movie's action scenes (races and chases) are boring and incoherent. If the movie can't deliver on its most important asset, what's the point?\"[19] | Richard Roeper strongly criticized the film, saying, \"The whole thing is preposterous. The acting is so awful, some of the worst performances I've seen in a long, long time.\"[20] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that Tokyo Drift \"suffers from blurred vision, motor drag and a plot that's running on fumes. Look out for a star cameo—it's the only surprise you'll get from this heap.\"[21] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said: \"[The main character] has no plan and no direction, just a blind desire to smash up automobiles and steal a mobster's girlfriend. [...] As for the racing scenes, who cares about the finesse move of drifting, compared to going fast? And who wants to watch guys race in a parking lot? For that matter, who wants to watch guys race down a mountain, with lots of turns?\"[22] | Rob Cohen, who directed the first film of the series, was very critical of this film, saying: \"If you were to just watch Tokyo Drift, you'd say 'I never want to see anything related to Fast & Furious again.'\"[23]","m_production":"\"After I'd seen Better Luck Tomorrow, I knew Justin was a director I wanted to do business with. He was the first we approached, and…he loved the idea of filming it. This movie needed enthusiasm, and he was the director to do it. Absolutely tireless.\" | Neal H. Moritz, who had produced the two previous installments, began working on the film in 2005. On June 8, 2005, Moritz hired Justin Lin to direct The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.[4] Lin, who wasn't intimately familiar with drifting when he was approached to helm the project, recalled: \"I was in film school when The Fast and the Furious came out, and I saw it along with a sold-out crowd who just ate it up. What really excited me about directing this film was the chance to harness that energy—create a whole new chapter and up the ante by bringing something new to the table for the audience who loves action and speed.\"[3] | Vin Diesel agreed to make a cameo in the film in exchange for Universal's ownership to rights of the Riddick series and character, in lieu of financial payment.[5] | The S15 Silvia which Black's character trashes in his first race in Japan is depicted as having an RB26DETT engine swap which itself is donated to the Mustang. However, the car in the movie was actually powered by the S15's original SR20DE engine.[6] The Veilside Fortune body-kitted RX-7 driven by Sung Kang's character was originally built by Veilside for the 2005 Tokyo Auto Salon but was later bought by Universal and repainted (the original was dark red, not orange and black like in the film).[7] | The car in which Vin Diesel's character appears at the end of the film is a highly customized 1970 Plymouth Satellite, Steven Strope's \"Hammer\", built for the SEMA show. It started life as a Satellite, but now is a GTX clone.[citation needed] | SCC tested the cars of the film, and noted that the cars in Tokyo Drift were slightly faster in an acceleration match up with the cars from 2 Fast 2 Furious.[8] | Notable drifting personalities Keiichi Tsuchiya, Rhys Millen, and Samuel Hubinette were consulted and employed by the movie to provide and execute the drifting and driving stunts in the film.[9] Tanner Foust, Rich Rutherford, Calvin Wan, and Alex Pfeiffer were also brought in when it was revealed that none of Universal's own stunt drivers could drift.[10] Some racing events were filmed within the Hawthorne Mall parking lot in Los Angeles.[11] | Toshi Hayama was also brought in to keep elements of the film portrayed correctly after being contacted by Roger Fan, an old high school friend who starred in Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow, the organizers of the Japanese series, and his former boss at A'PEXi. Among them were keeping certain references in check (the usage of nitrous oxide in straights but not in turns, keeping the usage of references from sponsors to a minimum, etc.).[12] Hayama also joked that a prop car was \"stolen\" by some of the action stars who took the car for an impromptu \"drift session\" from which the car never returned.[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters  by Gary Scott Thompson","m_directed_by":"Justin Lin","m_produced_by":"Neal H.
