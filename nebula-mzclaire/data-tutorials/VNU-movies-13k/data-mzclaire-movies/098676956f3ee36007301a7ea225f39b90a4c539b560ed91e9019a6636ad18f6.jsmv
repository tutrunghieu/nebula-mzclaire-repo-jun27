{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1823, Hugh Glass acts as a guide for Captain Andrew Henry’s party of trappers through unorganized U.S. territory (later the Dakotas). While he and his half-Pawnee son Hawk are hunting, the company's camp is attacked by a hostile \"Ree\" war party. Glass recommends that the survivors travel on foot to their outpost, Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver will make them vulnerable to another attack. Upon docking the boat alongside the river, the crew stashes the pelts they were able to secure during the Arikara attack close to shore. The matter is further complicated when Glass, while scouting, stumbles across a mother grizzly bear and her cubs. Although he manages to kill the bear, Glass is left with severe injuries and is near death. The belligerent trapper John Fitzgerald suggests that killing Glass would be a mercy, to which Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger. Instead, Henry offers money for anyone to stay behind with Glass in case he recovers or dies on his own. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the naïve youth Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay in order to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts. | After the other trappers leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass, but is stopped by Hawk. When Hawk tries to call for help, a panicked Fitzgerald stabs him. The next morning, Fitzgerald wakes Bridger and tells him that a party of Arikara are surrounding them. After departing, Bridger becomes suspicious of Fitzgerald, who admits that he lied. When Fitzgerald and Bridger meet up with Captain Henry at Fort Kiowa, Fitzgerald informs him that they were unable to save Glass and that Hawk had gone missing. Glass, meanwhile, refuses to die. He hauls himself from a shallow grave dug by Bridger and begins his arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude self-surgery to heal his wounds while attempting to elude the Arikara, who are still in pursuit. The Arikara chief, Elk Dog, is searching for his daughter, Powaqa, who was kidnapped by white men. | After narrowly escaping the Arikara again, Glass encounters a Pawnee refugee named Hikuc who warily allows the wounded man to share bison meat. The two men gradually form a bond as they travel. After a hallucinogenic experience, Glass awakens to discover Hikuc has been hanged by a group of French traders camped nearby. Glass discovers they are responsible for Powaqa’s abduction, and he manages to get the drop on a trapper as he rapes her. Powaqa castrates her rapist and flees while Glass steals a horse. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and is driven over a cliff. | A desperate survivor of the French party staggers into Fort Kiowa, where he is questioned about the attack on his men. He reveals he is carrying his attacker’s canteen (which Bridger immediately recognizes as belonging to Glass). Reasoning that Hawk might have been the one to carry the canteen, Bridger and Henry gather a search party. Fitzgerald, knowing that Glass is the only person who could’ve been in possession of the flask, empties the outpost’s payroll safe and flees before his crimes can be revealed. The search party finds an exhausted Glass, and an enraged Henry orders Bridger to be taken into custody. When the party returns to the fort, they find that Fitzgerald has fled. | After Glass vouches that Bridger was deceived into abandoning him, he and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald. When the two men split up to pick up signs of Fitzgerald's trail, Fitzgerald ambushes and shoots Henry. Glass arrives on the scene and fashions a decoy by dressing Henry's corpse in his own coat and propping it on his horse in order to pose as the dead Henry. Fitzgerald takes the bait and shoots the decoy, but when he arrives to check on the body, he realizes his mistake just as Glass springs his trap and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. Glass pursues Fitzgerald to a river bank, where the two men engage in a brutal fight. Glass gains the upper hand and is about kill Fitzgerald, but instead throws him into the water, which carries him downstream. Elk Dog, with Powaqa, drag Fitzgerald from the bank and kill him. The Arikara pass Glass, sparing him. Heavily wounded, and with his quest for revenge at an end, Glass retreats into the mountains, where he is visited by his deceased wife in spirit where she smiles at him before disappearing into the woods.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"As of May 12, 2016[update], The Revenant has grossed $183.6 million in North America and $347.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $530.7 million, against a budget of $135 million.[64] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $61.6 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[65] | In the United States and Canada, The Revenant opened in limited release on December 25, 2015, and over the weekend grossed $474,560 from four theaters in New York City and Los Angeles ($118,640 per screen), finishing twenty-third at the box office.[66] It was the second-biggest theater average of 2015 behind the $130,000 four-screen debut of Steve Jobs.[67] The film earned a total of $1.6 million from its two-week limited run[68] before expanding wide on January 8, 2016, across 3,371 theaters.[69] | It made $2.3 million from its early Thursday preview showings from 2,510 theaters.[68] On its opening day, the film earned $14.4 million, ranking first at the box office.[70] The film grossed $39.8 million in its opening weekend from 3,375 theaters, exceeding initial projections by 70%, and finishing second at the box office behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($42.4 million), which was on its fourth weekend of play. It was the director’s biggest opening of all-time, and the fourth-biggest for DiCaprio and supporting actor Tom Hardy.[71] Critics noted that The Force Awakens had an advantage, considering that it was playing at 781 more theaters, that Sunday matinees are family-friendly, and since it had the benefit of playing in all North American IMAX theaters.[71] Nevertheless, The Revenant played very balanced across the U.S. and overperformed in all states except the Northeast region.[71] Its wide release weekend is among the top openings in the month of January.[72] It finally topped the box office in its fifth weekend overall and third weekend in wide release after competing with Ride Along 2 in its second weekend. It added a $16 million in its third weekend, which was down 49.7% but topped the box office,[73] despite a blizzard blanketing most of the East Coast which reportedly hurt many films' box office performance.[74][75][76] The following weekend it was overtaken by Fox’s own animated movie Kung Fu Panda 3 thereby topping the box office for just one weekend.[77] Following the announcement of the Oscar nominees on January 14, The Revenant witnessed the biggest boost among the Best Picture category, jumping from $54.1 million to $170.5 million, an increase of +215% up to the Oscar ceremony in the weekend ending February 28.[78] | Outside North America, the film secured a release in 78 countries.[79] It made $20.5 million from 2,407 screens in just 18 markets, placing behind The Force Awakens at the international box office chart and first among newly released films.[80] The following weekend, it added $32.3 million from 25 markets on 4,849 screens.[79] The film topped the international box office in its third weekend—the same weekend when it topped the U.S. box office—overtaking The Force Awakens with $33.7 million from 48 markets.[81] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it took the No. 1 spot with $7.87 million[79] or £5.2 million ($7.4 million) from 589 theaters[82] and remained there for a second weekend declining only by 24% with £3.86 million ($5.5 million),[83] as well as for a third weekend.[84][85] Similarly, in Russia, it passed The Force Awakens to take the top spot with $7.5 million from 1,063 screens.[80] In France, it has the biggest opening day in Paris and the third biggest opening weekend of 2016 (so far) with $8.2 million.[86] It also opened at No. 1 in Mexico ($5.1 million), Spain ($4 million), Holland ($1.3 million), Belgium ($1.1 million), Argentina ($955,000), Sweden ($914,000), South Korea, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Egypt and Portugal among other markets.[79][81][84][87] In Germany ($4.6 million) and Australia ($2.9 million), it debuted at No. 2 both behind The Force Awakens and in Brazil ($2.17 million) behind The Ten Commandments.[80][87] It had one of the top ten openings of all time for a Fox film, not accounting for inflation in South Korea with $5.7 million and went on to top the box office there for a second weekend with $3.22 million despite cold weather affecting theater attendance resulting in low box office performance.[88][89] In Russia, despite not opening at No. 1, it topped the box office in its second weekend with $4.4 million—more than The Force Awakens[79]—and went on to top for a third weekend with $3.6 million.[90] In China it had an opening day of around $11 million from more than 11,000 screens, including $250,000 in midnight previews,[91][92] and $23 million in two days.[93] In its opening weekend, it grossed $31 million, coming in second place behind the animated Zootopia. IMAX comprised $2.3 million on 278 screens.[94] As of February 21, its largest markets outside of the U.S. and Canada in total earnings are China ($58 million), the United Kingdom ($30.9 million), France ($26.7 million) and Germany ($24.6 million).[95][96] The film opened in Japan on March 23.[86][97] | The Revenant has received positive reviews from critics, with the performances of DiCaprio and Hardy,[98][99] Iñárritu's directing[100] and Lubezki's cinematography[100] being praised. However, the film's runtime has been criticized.[101] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82%, based on 302 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"As starkly beautiful as it is harshly uncompromising, The Revenant uses Leonardo DiCaprio's committed performance as fuel for an absorbing drama that offers punishing challenges—and rich rewards.\"[102] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[103] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[104] | Reviewers cited in a CBS News survey of critics highly praised DiCaprio's performance, referring to it as an \"astonishing testament to his commitment to a role\" and as an \"anchoring performance of ferocious 200 percent commitment.\"[99] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called DiCaprio's acting \"a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and silent eloquence.\"[105] Writing for NY Magazine/Vulture, David Edelstein called the film a \"tour de force\" and \"[b]leak as hell but considerably more beautiful,\" but noted the film had \"traditional masculinity instead of a search for what illuminates man's inhumanity to man.\" | Justin Chang of Variety wrote Iñárritu \"increasingly succumbs to the air of grim overdetermination that has marred much of [his] past work\" and it was \"an imposing vision... but also an inflated and emotionally stunted one.\"[99] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for TIME magazine,[98] gave a positive review to the film stating: \"Inarritu may have fashioned The Revenant as the ultimate endurance test, but as Glass, DiCaprio simply endures. He gives the movie a beating heart, offering it up, figuratively speaking, alive and bloody on a platter. It—he—is the most visceral effect in the movie: revenge served warm. Bon Appetite.\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker was critical of the film, and said that Emmanuel Lubezki's images were mere \"pictorial ornament[s] to [Alejandro González Iñárritu's] bland theatrical stagings.”[106] | Slant Magazine's writer Ed Gonzalez suggested that the Slant staff in large part disliked the film: \"Our contempt for The Revenant knows no limits (...)\".[106] Gonzalez unfavorably compared Iñárritu's work to Terrence Malick's 2005 film The New World, of which Emmanuel Lubezki was the director of photography as well. In the official review, Slant writer Jaime N. Christley wrote: \"The Revenant [is] a misery-fest that plants its narrative flags as carelessly as a Roland Emmerich blockbuster, guaranteeing us a viewing experience almost as arduous as the trials depicted on screen, before reaching a conclusion that's sealed the moment audiences first meet the key players. After an obligatory false calm, The Revenant's proper opening scene is a show-stopping massacre at a fur-trapper's campsite. It's the kind of thing Howard Hawks would have handled—and did, in The Big Sky—in under 90 seconds, with mostly off-camera particulars and minimal effects, but González Iñárritu forces it to resemble the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan as much as history or sense will allow, and then some.\"[107] The Revenant was ranked 22nd on Metacritic's[108] and 79th on Rotten Tomatoes' list of best films of 2015.[109][110] | The Revenant has received numerous award nominations and wins, particularly for DiCaprio's performance, Iñárritu's direction and Lubezki's cinematography. At the 88th Annual Academy Awards, Iñárritu won the Best Director award for the second time in a row, Emmanuel Lubezki won for the third time in a row the award for Best Cinematography and DiCaprio won his first award for Best Actor. Hardy lost his category to Mark Rylance for Bridge of Spies, and the film itself lost Best Picture to Spotlight.[citation needed] | At the 73rd Golden Globe Awards it won three awards including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, and Best Actor – Drama, as well as a nomination for Best Original Score.[111] On January 14, 2016, the film received 12 Academy Award nominations (more than any other film at the ceremony), including Best Picture and Best Director for Iñárritu, as well as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, for DiCaprio and Hardy, respectively.[112] On February 14, 2016, the film received the most awards at 69th British Academy Film Awards out of eight-nominations, with five, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Leading Actor.[113] It received nine Critics' Choice Awards nominations, winning two – for DiCaprio as Best Actor and Best Cinematography for Lubezki.[114] | Tom Hardy won the Best British Actor award at the London Film Critics' Circle[115] and was runner-up for Best Supporting Actor at Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association.[116] DiCaprio was awarded Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role award at 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards, while Iñárritu received Outstanding Directing – Feature Film award at 68th Directors Guild of America Awards.[117] It received five Satellite Awards nominations, winning the award of Best Actor for DiCaprio.[118] | On May 2, 2016, Time magazine included both DiCaprio and Iñárritu in its issue of the 100 Most Influential People of 2015, with a cover photograph of DiCaprio on the magazine. John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, wrote a short testimonial to DiCaprio for this issue of Time stating that DiCaprio's dedication drives him to succeed and \"that's how he takes himself back 200 years to create an Oscar-winning, bear-brawling, powerhouse performance in The Revenant.\"[119]","m_production":"Development of The Revenant began in August 2001, with producer Akiva Goldsman acquiring the rights to Michael Punke's then-unpublished manuscript.[10] David Rabe had written the film's script.[11] The production was picked up by Park Chan-wook, with Samuel L. Jackson in mind to star. Park later left the project.[12][13] The development stalled until 2010, when Mark L. Smith wrote a new adaptation of the novel for Steve Golin's Anonymous Content. In May 2010, Smith revealed that John Hillcoat was attached to direct the film and that Christian Bale was in negotiation to star the movie.[14] Hillcoat left the project in October 2010.[13] Jean-François Richet was considered to replace him[13] but Alejandro G. Iñárritu signed on to direct in August 2011.[15] Goldsman was also confirmed to be producing with Weed Road Pictures.[15] In November, New Regency Productions joined to produce with Anonymous Content, and 20th Century Fox was confirmed to be distributing the film.[16][17] Days later, Iñárritu stated that he was seeking Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn for the two lead roles.[18] | Once Iñárritu agreed to direct, he began working with Smith on script rewrites. In an interview with Creative Screenwriting, Smith admitted during this process he was unsure if Iñárritu would even be able to film some of the sequences they wrote. He recalled, \"He would have some ideas and I would say, 'Alejandro, we can’t pull this off. It’s not going to work,' and he would say, 'Mark, trust me, we can do this.' In the end, he was right.\"[19] | The film was put on hold in March 2012, as New Regency hired Iñárritu to direct an adaptation of Jennifer Vogel's tome Flim-Flam Man, a non-fiction book about her criminal father.[20] Penn was also under consideration for the lead role in that film.[21] In December 2012, Iñárritu announced that his next film would be Birdman or: (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), a comedy about an actor who once played a famous superhero. For his work, Iñárritu won the Oscar for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and the film won Best Picture. Filming took place in March 2013.[22] Iñárritu was scheduled to begin production on The Revenant after Birdman wrapped.[23] | The film was granted a production budget of $60 million, with $30 million funded by New Regency. Brett Ratner's RatPac-Dune Entertainment, a joint venture between Ratner's RatPac Entertainment and 20th Century Fox's former financing partner, Dune Entertainment, also funded the film.[16] Worldview Entertainment, who also co-financed Birdman, was originally set to fund the film[23] but backed out in July 2014 due to the departure of its CEO, Christopher Woodrow.[16][24] New Regency approached 20th Century Fox for additional funding, but the company declined, citing the pay-or-play contracts made for both DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, which would require that the actors be paid regardless of whether the film is completed.[24] Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison entered negotiations to finance the film shortly after.[16][24] The Chinese company Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Company partially financed the film.[25] | Principal photography for The Revenant began in October 2014.[26] A planned two-week break from filming in December was extended to six weeks which forced Tom Hardy to drop out of Suicide Squad. In February 2015, Iñárritu, who shot the film using natural lighting,[27] stated that production would last \"until the end of April or May\", as the crew is \"shooting in such remote far-away locations that, by the time we arrive and have to return, we have already spent 40% of the day\".[28][29] Brad Weston, president and CEO of New Regency Pictures, stated that principal photography had been challenging due to the ambitious nature of the film. Ultimately, principal photography wrapped in August 2015.[30] | The film was shot in twelve locations in three countries: Canada, the United States, and Argentina.[31] In Canada, filming took place in Calgary and Fortress Mountain in Alberta, and at Squamish and Mammoth Studios, Burnaby, in British Columbia.[31] While the initial plan was to film entirely in Canada, the weather was ultimately too warm, leading the filmmakers to locations at the tip of Argentina with snow on the ground, to shoot the film's ending.[26] | Crew members often complained about difficult shoots, with many quitting or being fired. Mary Parent was then brought in as a producer.[26] Iñárritu stated that some of the crew members had left the film, explaining that \"as a director, if I identify a violin that is out of tune, I have to take that from the orchestra.\" On his experience filming, DiCaprio stated: \"I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do. Whether it’s going in and out of frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, or what I ate on set. [I was] enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly.\"[32][33] | Iñárritu had stated that he originally wanted to shoot the film chronologically, a process that would have added $7 million to the film's production budget.[34] Iñárritu later confirmed that the film was shot in-sequence,[35] despite Hardy's statement that the film could not be shot chronologically, due to weather conditions.[36] | In July 2015, it was reported that the film's budget had ballooned from the original $60 million to $95 million, and by the time production wrapped it had reached $135 million.[2] | The musical score for The Revenant was composed by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and German electronic musician Alva Noto with additional music composed by Bryce Dessner.[37] The main body of the score was recorded at the Seattlemusic Scoring Stage in the Bastyr Chapel in greater Seattle, Washington by musicians of the Northwest Sinfonia. Sakamoto conducted these sessions. Bryce Dessner's portion of the score was performed by the 25-piece Berlin-based orchestra known as \"s t a r g a z e\" under conductor André de Ridder.[38][39] Additional licensed music includes \"Become Ocean\", the Pulitzer Prize and Grammy Award winning work of John Luther Adams as recorded by the Seattle Symphony with conductor Ludovic Morlot and an excerpt of \"Jetsun Mila\" from French musician and composer Eliane Radigue.[40] A soundtrack album was released digitally on December 25, 2015, and on CD on January 8, 2016. Milan Records will release a vinyl pressing of the soundtrack in April 2016.[39] | The score by Sakamoto and Noto was ruled ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Score at the 2016 Oscars as it was deemed that it was \"assembled from the music of more than one composer\".[41] | The film was accompanied by a 44-minute documentary, named A World Unseen, highlighting the process of making the production. A World Unseen was released on January 21, 2016, on YouTube; both the date and medium of the documentary's release made it ineligible for Academy Award nomination for documentary subject in the same year as the film nomination.[42][43]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Revenant  by Michael Punke","m_directed_by":"Alejandro G.
