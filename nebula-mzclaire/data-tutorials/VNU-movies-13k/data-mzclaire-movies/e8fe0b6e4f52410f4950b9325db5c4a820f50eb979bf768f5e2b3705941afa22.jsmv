{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Late at night on a deserted road, well-known actor Armaan Kapoor (Vivan Bhatena) loses control of his car for no evident reason, apparently trying to avoid something, and drives into the sea. Inspector Surjan Shekhawat (Aamir Khan) with his assistant Devrath Kulkarni (Rajkummar Rao) begins an investigation into Armaan's death. Surjan's personal life is in turmoil since his 8-year-old son, Karan, drowned recently during a family outing. His wife, Roshni (Rani Mukerji), is still grieving and Surjan has developed a guilt complex. | Surjan learns that on the night of Armaan's accident, Armaan was travelling with 2 million rupees in cash, which is missing from the car. Armaan had given the money to a blackmailer, a pimp named Shashi (Subrat Dutta). Three years back, Shashi had performed a cover-up for Armaan and his friend Sanjay Kejriwal (Suhas Ahuja). Once he learns of Armaan's death, Shashi takes off with the cash, leaving behind a mistress, Mallika (Aditi Vasudev). Shashi's friend, Tehmur (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), steals Shashi's discarded sim card. Shashi begins blackmailing Sanjay. In panic, Sanjay employs some thugs to murder Shashi. Tehmur begins to use Shashi's old sim card to blackmail Sanjay with Shashi's murder. | Meanwhile, Roshni seeks solace from a medium (Shernaz Patel) who is in touch with Karan's soul. One night, Surjan is propositioned by an escort, Rosie (Kareena Kapoor). He declines Rosie's advances but asks her if she can become an informer. Through Rosie, Surjan finds out about Shashi's connection with the case. The police find Shashi's body, along with the blackmail money and a DVD. The DVD contains embarrassing CCTV footage of Armaan and his friends leaving a hotel with a girl. Convinced of Armaan's link with prostitutes, Surjan focuses his search on the slums near the Hotel Lido. To speak unobserved, Rosie takes Surjan to a quiet place by the riverside and tells him that three years ago, she was picked up by Armaan and his friends, Sanjay and Nikhil (Prashant Prakash). However, she doesn't reveal anything more. Surjan tries to approach Nikhil for more information but discovers that Nikhil has been brain-dead after the incident three years ago. After a heated argument with Roshni, Surjan confides in Rosie, who comforts him by taking him to the Lido. | Tehmur is killed by the two thugs in Sanjay's employ. One of the thugs is captured by the police and reveals that Sanjay has been behind the murders of both Shashi and Tehmur. Surjan arrests Sanjay, who confesses that three years ago, Sanjay, Armaan and Nikhil had picked up an escort to celebrate Nikhil's birthday. While driving, Nikhil began making out with the girl in the backseat. The car door opened by accident, throwing both Nikhil and the girl from the moving car to the road. Both were badly injured. Armaan and Sanjay rushed Nikhil to the hospital but fearing scandal, left the girl unattended on the road. Sanjay had called Shashi to ask him to take care of her. However, Shashi informed them that the girl had died and that he had footage of the three leaving with her. Since then, Shashi had continued to extort money from them by blackmail. | Surjan re-watches the footage and realizes that the girl is Rosie. As he drives Sanjay to the police station, they approach the same road where Armaan had his car accident. Both Surjan and Sanjay see Rosie standing ahead. In a re-enactment of Armaan's accident, Sanjay swerves the car into the sea. With Sanjay already dead, Surjan struggles to get himself out of the car. Rosie appears underwater and saves him. At the police station, Surjan's superior advises him against reporting his incredible story. Surjan agrees to write in the official report that Armaan Kapoor's death was an accident. He returns to the riverside place where he used to meet Rosie and uncovers her remains where Shashi had hidden her body. Remembering that he had been told that \"the dead come to those who are troubled,\" he gives her a proper funeral. | Now more accepting of the supernatural, Surjan finds a letter from Karan, penned by the medium. Through the letter, Karan tells Surjan not to blame himself for his death and that he wants both his parents to be happy. Surjan cries and Roshni consoles him. The two are reconciled.","m_cast":"Aamir Khan as Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat | Rani Mukerji as Roshni Shekhawat | Kareena Kapoor as Rosie / Simran | Shadab Shaikh as Guest Appearance | Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Tehmur | Shernaz Patel as Frenny | Rajkummar Rao as Devrath Kulkarni | Sheeba Chaddha as Nirmala | Vivan Bhatena as Armaan Kapoor | Pariva Pranati as Soniya Kapoor | Aditi Vasudev as Mallika | Subrat Dutta as Shashi | Gulfam Khan as Madam | Mamnoon Ahmad as ASP","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Following the release of her first film, Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. (2007), Kagti was approached and offered to direct many films by several production houses. However, unable to find any films that interested her, she began working on a new script with her friend Zoya Akhtar in early 2010. Speaking about it, she said, \"Zoya and I thought of the story and co-wrote it. We do a lot of writing together. We are also best friends so it is fun and there is a huge comfort factor.\" Initially, Saif Ali Khan, Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan were reportedly approached to play the male lead but opted out due to differing reasons.[8][9][10] Upon finalising the story, she approached Aamir Khan with the script in November 2010 and he agreed to produce and star in it.[11] Since the start of pre-production, the project has faced several speculations regarding its title.[12] In November 2011, Khan confirmed that the film was titled Talaash: The Answer Lies Within.[12] | In an interview with The Indian Express, Kagti revealed that a few months before casting Khan in the film, she had approached him with another project.[13] Later, Rani Mukerji and Kareena Kapoor were signed on to star opposite Khan.[14] Prior to the start of principal photography, the actors attended acting workshops and signed a non-disclosure agreement.[15] To prepare for a key scene in the film, Khan took swimming lessons.[16] | The principal photography for the film started in March 2011 with Khan and Mukerji in Mumbai.[4] For a scene involving Khan and Kapoor, it was reported that both the actors would shoot in a red-light district.[17] However, Kagti dismissed it and explained that it wouldn't be safe to do so. The scene was later shot at the Leopold Cafe on Colaba Causeway.[15] The film's second phase continued with the entire cast in Pondicherry and was completed by the end of August.[18] The final phase was expected to commence the following month in Khopoli with an underwater shot.[19] | Aamir, who never knew how to swim went under rigorous training for this underwater sequence. He was trained for three months under a specialist trainer and went well prepared for the shoot. Due to visibility problems, it was cancelled and later filmed at an undisclosed water studio in London.[20] The filming was completed by November 2011 after some of the remaining shots were executed at the Bandstand Promenade.[21]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Reema Kagti","m_produced_by":"Ritesh Sidhwani Aamir Khan Farhan Akhtar","m_screenplay_by":"Reema Kagti Zoya Akhtar","m_story_by":"Reema Kagti Zoya Akhtar","m_starring":"Aamir Khan Rani Mukerji Kareena Kapoor Khan","m_music_by":"Ram Sampath","m_cinematography":"K.
