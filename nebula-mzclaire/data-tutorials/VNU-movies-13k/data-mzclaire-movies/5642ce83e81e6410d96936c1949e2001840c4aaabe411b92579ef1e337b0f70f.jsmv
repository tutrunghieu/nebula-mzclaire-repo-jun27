{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Tom and Jerry together with their owners are about to move to a new home. The moving van is at their old house waiting, and Tom dozes in the back of the car. However, when he notices Jerry he puts him on a stick, and Jerry, noticing no escape and knowing that he will fly, he grabs hold of Tom's whiskers so they fly together into the garden. He quickly dashes into his mousehole and locks the door, Tom nailing wooden planks on the door. When Tom tries to get in the moving car, he ends up with a bulldog and ties up his ears so he cannot see. Tom runs into the house for safety and stays there for the night. | Next day, Tom and Jerry notice that the house is broken down to make a new apartment as a replacement. They meet a dog named Puggsy and his friend Frankie the Flea that tries to teach Tom and Jerry to be friends. Then they all agree to have a 'feast' at their place and Puggsy makes a 'buffet' by collecting leftovers in the bin. When Puggsy's tray is crammed a couple of dogcatchers capture Puggsy and Frankie and lock them in their car. | Tom and Jerry then meet a nine-year-old girl named Robyn Starling, the daughter of Daddy Starling, whose mother died when she was a baby and is left behind with her evil guardian Aunt Christine Figg when her dad goes away. Robyn runs away after her locket is thrown out the window and that's how she began to run. Jerry said to her if she runs, her things won't be with her but Robyn said to them that Aunt Figg may seem sweet but she's real mean. | Cut to Aunt Figg crying in the house, scared of losing Robyn. With the help of her sleazy lawyer, Lickboot and her overweight dachshund, Ferdinand, make a reward of a million dollars for the return of Robyn, who they wish to sell for a ransom, engulfed by love of money. Robyn is recaptured, but manages to escape yet again, after Tom and Jerry are kidnapped by the ruthless Dr. Applecheek and the straycatchers where animals are abused. Tom and Jerry helped Puggsy and Frankie escape. At this point, everybody is looking for the million dollar girl, and Figg and Lickboot manage to get to Robyn's escape destination first. Dr. Applecheek wanted to get Robyn first, but he falls into the creek. What was planned as another capture quickly goes wrong when an oil lamp is knocked on the floor. | When the house goes up in flames, Tom and Jerry help Robyn out of the cabin, while Figg, Lickboot and Ferdinand flee into a boat, which drives them away; Mr. Starling finally comes and rescues Robyn. Tom and Jerry are rescued too and taken to a new home where they both promise to never trick each other again. But as soon as Robyn and her dad are out of sight, the pair have soon reverted to their old ways, and the movie finishes with Tom chasing Jerry.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film has been criticized particularly for giving dialogue to the normally silent stars Tom and Jerry, although in some cartoons from back in the 1940s and 50s, the two protagonists had some spoken dialogue. Joseph McBride of Variety remarked, \"'Tom and Jerry Talk' won't go down in film history as a slogan to rival 'Garbo Talks'.\"[1] Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times criticized the film's songs. Solomon also criticized Phil Roman for his direction.[2] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post complained about the dialogue between the cat and mouse, and said that the voices \"don't fit the characters\". Hinson also said that the musical numbers are \"forgettable as they are intolerably bouncy and upbeat\".[4] | Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, on their show Siskel & Ebert gave the movie \"Two Thumbs Down\", though praising the animation, look and the truthful art design of the animated shorts, neither thought that it was a good idea to give dialogue to the two characters, giving lack of more slapstick action from past cartoons and that the story was silly, even considering that the character of Robyn Starling takes most of the attention than the cat and mouse themselves. | However, Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave a positive review of the film. Canby praised Henry Mancini's score to the movie and musical numbers. Canby later went on to say, \"[the characters of] Tom and Jerry have charm.\"[5] As of June 2016, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 18% of critics gave positive reviews on the film, based on 11 reviews.[6] | The film opened in the United States and Canada on July 30, 1993, the same weekend as Rising Sun, Robin Hood: Men in Tights and So I Married an Axe Murderer.[7] Opening at #14 on its opening weekend, the film made $3,560,469 at the North American box office, making it financially unsuccessful.[7][8]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Tom and Jerry created   by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera","m_directed_by":"Phil Roman","m_produced_by":"Phil Roman Bill Schultz (co-producer)","m_screenplay_by":"Dennis Marks","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Richard Kind Dana Hill Anndi McAfee Charlotte Rae Tony Jay Ed Gilbert David Lander Henry Gibson Rip Taylor","m_music_by":"Henry Mancini","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":"Turner Entertainment Co.
