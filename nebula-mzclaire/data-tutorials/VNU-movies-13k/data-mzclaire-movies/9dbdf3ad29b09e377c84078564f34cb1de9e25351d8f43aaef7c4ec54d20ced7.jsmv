Hammer's American distributor refused to release the film without Dracula appearing, prompting Hammer to convince Lee to return, with Dracula replacing the resurrected Courtley.[1][2][3] | Vincent Price was originally cast to play one of the dissipated British gentlemen, but when the budget for the film was cut, the studio could no longer afford Price and he was released from his contract.[citation needed] | The scenes of the gentlemen's visit to the local brothel were heavily edited on the film's original release. They are fully re-instated on the DVD release. | In its original United States release, it was rated GP (General audience, Parental guidance suggested—the forerunner to today's PG), but when it was re-released to DVD it was rated R for sexual content/nudity, and brief violence. | An alternate version of the scene where Lucy bites Jeremy was filmed, with the young man actually becoming a vampire. This scene was not used, possibly to avoid complicating the plot further with the introduction of another vampire.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Peter Sasdy","m_produced_by":"Aida Young","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Christopher Lee Geoffrey Keen Gwen Watford","m_music_by":"James Bernard","m_cinematography":"Arthur Grant","m_edited_by":"Chris Barnes","m_production_company":"Hammer Films","m_distributed_by":"Warner-Pathé (UK) Warner Bros.
