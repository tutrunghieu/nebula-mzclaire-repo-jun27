{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Floreal is released from prison prior to the end of a military coup d'état in 1983. He discovers his wife has cheated on him and is not sure he wants to return to his former life and family. A friend, \"El-Negro\", who was killed during the military coup, appears in the night with a special mission: to help Floreal face what has happened when he was serving time in prison. El-Negro helps him to live through the important events that happened in his absence. El-Negro helps him get past his anger, understanding how hard it was to endure such a difficult time and how the military coup had crushed people's lives. When El-Negro finally tells him he must return, Floreal realizes he must be strong and, like his coup-stricken country, pick up and go on with his life.","m_cast":"Susú Pecoraro as Rosi Echegoyen | Miguel Ángel Solá as Floreal Echegoyen | Philippe Léotard as Roberto | Lito Cruz as El Negro | Ulises Dumont as Emilio | Roberto Goyeneche as Amado | Gabriela Toscano as Blondi | Mario Lozano as Echegoyen | Nathán Pinzón as Rasatti | Antonio Ameijeiras as Peregrino | Inés Molina as María | Fito Páez as Marcelo | Niní Gambier as Adela | Chany Mallo as Floreal's mother | Susana Mayo as Cora | Ricardo Alaniz as Arturito | Luis Romero as Yacumin","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Fernando E.
