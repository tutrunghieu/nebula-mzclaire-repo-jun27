{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"An American dancer, Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) comes to London to star in a show produced by the bumbling Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton). While practicing a tap dance routine in his hotel bedroom, he awakens Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) on the floor below. She storms upstairs to complain, whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly in love with her and proceeds to pursue her all over London. | Dale mistakes Jerry for Horace, who is married to her friend Madge (Helen Broderick). Following the success of Jerry's opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to Venice, where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes), a dandified Italian fashion designer with a penchant for malapropisms. | Jerry proposes to Dale, who, while still believing that Jerry is Horace, is disgusted that her friend's husband could behave in such a manner and agrees instead to marry Alberto. Fortunately, Bates (Eric Blore), Horace's meddling English valet, disguises himself as a priest and conducts the ceremony; Horace had sent Bates to keep tabs on Dale. | On a trip in a gondola, Jerry manages to convince Dale and they return to the hotel where the previous confusion is rapidly cleared up. The reconciled couple dance off into the Venetian sunset, to the tune of \"The Piccolino\".[8]","m_cast":"Notable bit parts:","m_reception":"The film earned $1,782,000 in the US and Canada and $1,420,000 elsewhere. RKO made a profit of $1,325,000, making it the studio's most profitable film of the 1930s.[4] | Reviews for Top Hat were mainly positive. The Los Angeles Evening Herald Express praised the film, exclaiming \"Top Hat is the tops! With Fred Astaire dancing and singing Irving Berlin tunes! Well, one (in his right mind) couldn't ask for much more — unless, of course, it could be a couple of encores.\" The New York Times praised the film's musical numbers, but criticized the story line, describing it as \"a little on the thin side,\" but also stating that \"it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the shimmeringly gay dances.\"Top Hat\" is worth standing in line for. From the appearance of the lobby yesterday afternoon, you probably will have to.\"[44] | Variety also singled out the story line as well as the cast, stating \"the danger sign is in the story and cast. Substitute Alice Brady for Helen Broderick and it's the same lineup of players as was in The Gay Divorcée. Besides which the situations in the two scripts parallel each other closely\". Nevertheless, it concluded that Top Hat was a film \"one can't miss\".[45] | The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as Art Direction (Carroll Clark and Van Nest Polglase), Original Song (Irving Berlin for \"Cheek to Cheek\"), and Dance Direction (Hermes Pan for \"Piccolino\" and \"Top Hat\").[46] In 1990, Top Hat was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[47] The film ranked number 15 on the 2006 American Film Institute's list of best musicals.[48]","m_production":"Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 and cost $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June and the first public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of approximately ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed to show off the huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut[9] before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s.[10] After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.[6] | Dwight Taylor was the principal screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that \"it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee\", and \"I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour\".[5] Allan Scott, whose first major project this was, and who would go on to serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout.[6] The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: \"For the women the kiss, for the men the sword\" which originally ran: \"For the men the sword, for the women the whip.\"[6][11] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared \"a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture can be summed up in the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'\"[6][12] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.[10] | This was composer Irving Berlin's first complete film score since 1930 and he negotiated a unique contract, retaining the copyrights to the score with a guarantee of ten per-cent of the profits if the film earned in excess of $1,250,000.[10] Eight songs from the original score were discarded as they were not considered to advance the film's plot.[10] One of these: \"Get Thee Behind Me, Satan\" was recycled into Follow the Fleet (1936). All five songs eventually selected became major hits and, in the September 28, 1935 broadcast of Your Hit Parade, all five featured in the top fifteen songs selected for that week.[10] | Astaire recalled how this success helped restore Berlin's flagging self-confidence. Astaire had never met Berlin before this film, although he had danced on stage to some of his tunes as early as 1915. There ensued a lifelong friendship with Berlin contributing to more Astaire films (six in total) than any other composer. Of his experience with Astaire in Top Hat Berlin wrote: \"He's a real inspiration for a writer. I'd never have written Top Hat without him. He makes you feel so secure.\"[5] | As Berlin could not read or write music, and could only pick out tunes on a specially designed piano that transposed keys automatically, he required an assistant to make up his piano parts. Hal Borne – Astaire's rehearsal pianist – performed this role in Top Hat and recalled working nights with him in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel: \"Berlin went 'Heaven...' and I went dah dah dee 'I'm in Heaven' (dah-dah-dee). He said, 'I love it, put it down.'\"[6] These parts were subsequently orchestrated by a team comprising Edward Powell, Maurice de Packh, Gene Rose, Eddie Sharp, and Arthur Knowlton who worked under the overall supervision of Max Steiner.[5] | Berlin broke a number of the conventions of American songwriting in this film, especially in the songs \"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\" and \"Cheek to Cheek\",[13] and, according to Rogers, the film became the talk of Hollywood as a result of its score.[13] | In an Astaire-Rogers picture, the Big White Set — as these Art Deco-inspired creations were known — took up the largest share of the film's production costs, and Top Hat was no exception. A winding canal — spanned by two staircase bridges at one end and a flat bridge on the other — was built across two adjoining sound stages. Astaire and Rogers dance across this flat bridge in \"Cheek to Cheek\". Around the bend from this bridge was located the main piazza, a giant stage coated in red bakelite and this was the location for \"The Piccolino\". This fantasy representation[14] of the Lido of Venice was on three levels comprising dance floors, restaurants and terraces, all decorated in candy-cane colours, with the canal waters dyed black. The vast Venetian interiors were similarly inauthentic, reflecting instead the latest Hollywood tastes.[15] | Carroll Clark, who worked under the general supervision of Van Nest Polglase, was the unit art director on all but one of the Astaire-Rogers films and he managed the team of designers responsible for the scenery and furnishings of Top Hat. | Although Bernard Newman was nominally in charge of dressing the stars, Rogers was keenly interested in dress design and make-up.[16] For the \"Cheek to Cheek\" routine, she was determined to use her own creation: \"I was determined to wear this dress, come hell or high water. And why not? It moved beautifully. Obviously, no one in the cast or crew was willing to take sides, particularly not my side. This was all right with me. I'd had to stand alone before. At least my mother was there to support me in the confrontation with the entire front office, plus Fred Astaire and Mark Sandrich.\"[17] | Due to the enormous labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress, Astaire — who normally approved his partner's gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals — saw the dress for the first time on the day of the shoot,[18] and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn, recalling later: \"It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote, I never saw so many feathers in my life.\"[19][20] According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, \"came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young.\"[21] An additional night's work by seamstresses resolved much of the problem, however, careful examination of the dance on film reveals feathers floating around Astaire and Rogers and lying on the dance floor.[5] Later, Astaire and Pan presented Rogers with a gold feather for her charm bracelet, and serenaded her with a ditty parodying Berlin's tune: | Thereafter, Astaire nicknamed Rogers \"Feathers\" — also a title of one of the chapters in his autobiography — and parodied his experience in a song and dance routine with Judy Garland in Easter Parade (1948).[5] | Astaire also chose and provided his own clothes. He is widely credited with influencing 20th Century male fashion and, according to Forbes male fashion editor, G. Bruce Boyer, the \"Isn't It a Lovely Day?\" routine: \"shows Astaire dressed in the style he would make famous: soft-shouldered tweed sports jacket, button-down shirt, bold striped tie, easy-cut gray flannels, silk paisley pocket square, and suede shoes. It's an extraordinarily contemporary approach to nonchalant elegance, a look Ralph Lauren and a dozen other designers still rely on more than six decades later. Astaire introduced a new style of dress that broke step with the spats, celluloid collars, and homburgs worn by aristocratic European-molded father-figure heroes.\"[23]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Scandal in Budapest (play) by Sándor Faragó (uncredited) A Girl Who Dares (play) by Aladar Laszlo (uncredited)[1]","m_directed_by":"Mark Sandrich","m_produced_by":"Pandro S.

He meets and attempts to impress Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) to win her affection. The film also features Eric Blore as Hardwick's valet Bates, Erik Rhodes as Alberto Beddini, a fashion designer and rival for Dale's affections, and Helen Broderick as Hardwick's long-suffering wife Madge. | The film was written by Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor. It was directed by Mark Sandrich. The songs were written by Irving Berlin. \"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\" and \"Cheek to Cheek\" have become American song classics. It has been nostalgically referred to — particularly its \"Cheek to Cheek\" segment — in many films, including The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) and The Green Mile (1999). | Top Hat was the most successful picture of Astaire and Rogers' partnership (and Astaire's second most successful picture after Easter Parade), achieving second place in worldwide box-office receipts for 1935.[5] While some dance critics maintain that Swing Time contained a finer set of dances,[5][6] Top Hat remains, to this day, the partnership's best-known work.[7] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"Notes | ^ a b Evans (2011), p.6 | ^ Brown, Gene (1995).
