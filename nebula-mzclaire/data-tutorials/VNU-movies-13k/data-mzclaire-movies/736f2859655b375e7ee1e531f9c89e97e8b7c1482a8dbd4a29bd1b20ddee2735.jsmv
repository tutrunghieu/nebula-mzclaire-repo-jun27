{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set in a small rural village in Japan in the 19th century. According to tradition, once a person reaches the age of 70 he or she must travel to a remote mountain to die of starvation, a practice known as ubasute. The story concerns Orin, who is 69 and of sound health, but notes that a neighbor had to drag his father to the mountain, so she resolves to avoid clinging to life beyond her term. She spends a year arranging all the affairs of her family and village: she severely punishes a family who are hoarding food, and helps her younger son lose his virginity. | The film has some harsh scenes that show how brutal the conditions could be for the villagers. Interspersed between episodes in the film are brief vignettes of nature – birds, snakes, and other animals hunting, watching, singing, copulating or giving birth.","m_cast":"Ken Ogata – Tatsuhei | Sumiko Sakamoto – Orin | Tonpei Hidari – Risuke | Aki Takejo – Tamayan (as Aki Takejō) | Shoichi Ozawa – Katsuzō (as Shōichi Ozawa) | Fujio Tokita – Jinsaku | Sanshō Shinsui – Zeniya no Tadayan | Seiji Kurasaki – Kesakichi | Junko Takada – Matsuyan | Mitsuko Baisho – Oei (as Mitsuko Baishō) | Taiji Tonoyama – Teruyan | Casey Takamine – Arayashiki (as Kêshi Takamine) | Nenji Kobayashi – Tsune | Nijiko Kiyokawa – Okane | Akio Yokoyama – Amaya","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Shōhei Imamura","m_produced_by":"Goro Kusakabe Jiro Tomoda","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ken Ogata Sumiko Sakamoto Takejo Aki Tonpei Hidari Seiji Kurasaki Kaoru Shimamori Ryutaro Tatsumi Junko Takada Nijiko Kiyokawa Mitsuko Baisho","m_music_by":"Shinichirô Ikebe","m_cinematography":"Masao Tochizawa","m_edited_by":"Hajime Okayasu","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Toei Co.
