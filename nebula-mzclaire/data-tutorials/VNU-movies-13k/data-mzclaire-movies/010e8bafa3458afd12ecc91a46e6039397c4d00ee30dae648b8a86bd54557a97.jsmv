Among the group is Dennis (Timothy Olyphant), a photographer who often holds the group together; Cole (Dean Cain) a handsome, charismatic actor who — often unwittingly — ends up with other people's boyfriends; Benji (Zach Braff), the youngest member of the group, with a penchant for gym-bodied men, who finds himself going through some bad times; Howie (Matt McGrath), a psychology student who is known for overthinking every situation; Patrick (Ben Weber), the cynic of the group; and Taylor (Billy Porter), who has just broken up with his long-term boyfriend. | Guiding them is restaurant owner Jack (John Mahoney) who provides them with advice and jobs for some of them who work part-time as servers at his restaurant. But when tragedy strikes, and the group's newest member, 23-year-old Kevin (Andrew Keegan), attempts to fit in, their friendships are put to the test. | The film also stars Nia Long, Mary McCormack and Justin Theroux, and features a cameo by Kerr Smith, who knew the director through their work on Dawson's Creek and enjoyed the script so much he asked to be a part of it, and Jennifer Coolidge as the hairdresser Betty, that all the guys, with the exception of Howie, go to for hair therapy.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Greg Berlanti","m_produced_by":"Mickey Liddell Joseph Middleton Julie Plec (co-producer)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ben Weber Timothy Olyphant Matt McGrath Zach Braff Dean Cain Andrew Keegan Billy Porter","m_music_by":"Christophe Beck","m_cinematography":"Paul Elliott","m_edited_by":"Todd Busch","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Sony Pictures Entertainment","m_release_dates":"September 29, 2000 (2000-09-29) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$1 million","m_box_office":"$2,019,121 | The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy is a 2000 American film written and directed by Greg Berlanti.

The friends rely on each other for friendship and support as they search for love, deal with loss, and discover themselves. | The Broken Hearts Club was Berlanti's first feature film, based around his circle of friends at the time. The movie was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, receiving praise for portraying homosexuality as normal and its characters as average gay men. The film focuses on \"the universal themes of romance, acceptance and family\", as opposed to AIDS, coming out, and sex, which are more controversial and stereotypical topics commonly covered in LGBT films.[1] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d Paul Clinton (2000-10-03). \"See 'The Broken Hearts Club' with someone special\".
