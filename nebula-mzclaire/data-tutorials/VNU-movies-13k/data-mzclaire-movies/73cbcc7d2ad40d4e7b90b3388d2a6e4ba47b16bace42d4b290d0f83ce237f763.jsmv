{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After winning a lifetime achievement award, esteemed screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) has a rude awakening. Steven believes the award has no real meaning, but it does—it means his career is over. His studio has reneged on his contract and told him he's gone cold, saying he's \"lost his edge.\" A junior exec (Mark Feuerstein) tells Steven his new script is dull and to be off the lot by 5 p.m. | Taken by surprise, the Oscar-nominated writer is desperate to revive his career. He seeks the advice of a very successful screenwriter buddy, Jack (Bridges), who arranges an introduction to Sarah (Stone), a modern day muse who can inspire anyone. | Sarah, however, has conditions and unnecessarily lavish needs, such as expensive hotel rooms and gifts from Tiffany & Co. Steven is forced to make good on those conditions, much to the chagrin of his wife Laura (MacDowell). | Steven isn't sure if the muse could be the real thing or just somebody sucking him dry of his money and patience. She takes him to Long Beach, where they encounter writer-director Rob Reiner, someone Sarah clearly knows. Steven gets an idea for a movie set in an aquarium. | As Sarah's demands increase, Steven's apprehensive wife begins to be won over. Through the muse's encouragement Laura decides to pursue her dream of baking and selling cookies, to much fanfare and success. | To save money, Sarah is invited by the Phillipses to move into their house. Steven, however, is frustrated because Sarah spends more time helping others—notably Hollywood writers and directors like James Cameron and Martin Scorsese, who come to Steven's house to see her. Steven even surrenders his own bedroom to Sarah and sleeps in the guest house. | When he pleads for a way to end his aquarium screenplay, Sarah does point Steven in the right direction and inspires him with a great idea. Steven's agent Hal is thrilled and urges him to finish the script as quickly as possible. | The following morning, though, two visitors come to Steven's home, revealing that they are doctors from a mental clinic. They tell Steven that Sarah is an escaped psychiatric patient from their asylum who has multiple personality disorder. They find the whole \"muse\" idea hilarious. When they try to find Sarah to take her back, they discover that she has escaped. | The junior exec, Josh, loves Steven's script, but he breaks the news that the idea is already in production at another studio—by Rob Reiner. A broken-hearted Steven goes to work in his wife's new cookie business. | Things turn around when the agent calls to inform Steven that the Reiner project fell through and the studio wants to purchase his version, contingent upon a few changes being made. An excited Steven goes to the studio, where a secretary reveals that a new boss, Christine, is now in charge. Christine is revealed to be Sarah. She takes Steven's arm and insists that they discuss the changes over a nice, expensive lunch, which she expects him to pay for.","m_cast":"Albert Brooks as Steven Phillips | Sharon Stone as Sarah Little | Andie MacDowell as Laura Phillips | Jeff Bridges as Jack Warrick | Mark Feuerstein as Josh Martin | Bradley Whitford as Hal | Steven Wright as Stan Spielberg | Jennifer Tilly as herself | Rob Reiner as himself | Wolfgang Puck as himself | James Cameron as himself | Martin Scorsese as himself | Lorenzo Lamas as himself","m_reception":"The Muse was a slight box office flop, grossing about $11 million domestically on an estimated budget of $15 million. It did relatively poorly at the box office compared to some of Brooks' other films, such as Defending Your Life (1991), which made $16 million, and Mother (1996), which made $19 million. Critical reception was lukewarm (52% rating at Rotten Tomatoes), but critics who were fans of the film included Leonard Maltin, Roger Ebert, and Desson Howe.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Albert Brooks","m_produced_by":"Herb Nanas","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Albert Brooks Sharon Stone Andie MacDowell Jeff Bridges Steven Wright Mark Feuerstein","m_music_by":"Elton John","m_cinematography":"Thomas Ackerman","m_edited_by":"Peter Teschner","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"October Films","m_release_dates":"August 27, 1999 (1999-08-27) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"97 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$15 million","m_box_office":"$11,614,954 | The Muse is a 1999 comedy film starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell and Jeff Bridges, directed by Brooks. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ The Muse (1999) film review by Janet Maslin, The New York Times, August 27, 1999 | ^ Wolk, Josh (December 21, 1999). \"Bribe, She Said\".
