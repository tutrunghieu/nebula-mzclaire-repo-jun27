{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On the Swiss mountain Trollenberg, one of three student climbers is suddenly killed, his head ripped from his body. Two sisters, Anne (Janet Munro) and Sarah Pilgrim (Jennifer Jayne), a London mind-reading act, are travelling by train to Geneva when Anne faints as the train passes the mountain. Upon waking, Anne insists that they must get off at the next stop. | UN troubleshooter Alan Brooks (Forrest Tucker), who was in the same compartment on-board the train as the sisters, goes to an observatory on the Trollenberg, where Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell) has asked for his help. The professor explains that, despite many climbing accidents, no bodies are ever found, and an always-stationery radioactive cloud is regularly observed on the mountain's south face. Brooks learns that similar incidents took place in the Andes three years earlier, before a similar radioactive cloud vanished without a trace. Rumors circulated amongst the locals that something was living amidst the cloud, shrouded by the mist. | That evening, Anne is giving a mind-reading demonstration at the hotel when she \"sees\" two men in a base camp hut on the mountain: Dewhurst (Stuart Saunders) is asleep when the other man, Brett (Andrew Faulds), seemingly under some kind of mental compulsion, walks outside. The cloud has now moved down to envelop the hut. Before she can discern any further events, Anne suddenly faints again. Brooks then phones the hut, but no one answers. | A hastily-convened rescue party ventures out to the hut looking for both men. Anne, in a trance-like state, urges the rescuers to stay away. Inside the hut, the group discover that everything inside is frozen solid, despite the hut being locked from the inside. Dewhurst's body is found under the bed, its head missing. A spotter aircraft arrives and circles overhead, and they spot a man off in the distance. Upon being directed to his location, the first rescuer finds a rucksack with a severed head inside. He is quickly set upon and killed by Brett, who also attacks and kills a second rescuer when he arrives. | Making his way to the hotel, Brett storms in and launches a focused attack on Anne. Despite his unnatural strength, the men manage to subdue him. During the struggle, Brett sustains a severe gash to his head, and everyone present is shocked when no blood flows from the wound. Brett is heavily sedated and locked away. While discussing this disturbing turn of events, Brooks recalls that the incident in the Andes three years previously followed a similar pattern: a man murdered an elderly woman who allegedly possessed psychic abilities akin to those displayed by Anne. Upon later examination, the killer's body was discovered to have been deceased for at least 24 hours prior to his murder of the old women. As the group struggle to understand the nature of the phenomena confronting them, Brett escapes his improvised cell and resumes his hunt for Anne, this time armed with a small hand axe. Before he can cause any further grief, however, he is quickly shot and killed by Brooks. | News arrives that the cloud has begun to move down the mountainside, towards the hotel, so the group decide to retreat to the relative safety of the heavily fortified observatory. As the guests begin loading the cable car, a mother realises that her young daughter is missing. In a thickening mist, a giant, multi-tentacled creature with a single huge eye appears at the hotel, smashing down the front door. Brooks manages to rescue the missing child from the lobby, with both of them narrowly escaping the cycloptic horror's grasp. They make it back to the cable car, but the delay has given the thickening mist a chance to reach the car platform. The transport motor begins to freeze, starting and stopping, the cable slipping, but the cable car arrives safely. The single cloud has now split and become four while converging on the observatory. | Hans (Colin Douglas), who tried to leave the hotel by car, suddenly turns up at the observatory. Once inside, he begins exhibiting the same obsession with finding Anne. Hans tries to strangle her, but the group can only stop him by killing him. The tentacled monsters are almost at the observatory, but everyone has been making Molotov cocktails to combat them. In the meantime, by radio, Alan orders an aerial firebombing raid against the observatory, which has a reinforced concrete roof and walls that can withstand the assault. | Journalist Philip Truscott (Laurence Payne) strikes one of the creatures with a Molotov cocktail, setting it ablaze. He is caught from above by one of the tentacled monsters on the observatory's roof. With another Molotov cocktail, Brooks sets that one ablaze, forcing the burning creature to release Truscott. Later, Truscott does the same as another one-eyed monster manages to breach a thick wall, trying to get at Anne. The aerial firebombing assault begins and is successful at torching the remaining creatures.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin considered The Trollenberg Terror as \"ok, if predictable\", a feature that showed its humble origins being adapted by Jimmy Sangster from the British TV series \"The Trollenberg Terror\" about cloud-hiding alien invaders on a Swiss mountaintop.
