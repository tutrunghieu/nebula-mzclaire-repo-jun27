{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Josie Potenza is the trophy wife of workaholic Hollywood producer Tony Potenza, but their marriage is crumbling due to his increased drinking resulting from stress at work. She convinces him to join her for a romantic getaway at a secluded lakeside cabin, but when it becomes obvious his concerns about the studio are going to take precedence over relaxation, she grudgingly tells him to return home but decides to stay on her own for a few days. | Josie sees Cole Wilson ogling her at a local bar and, uncomfortable with the unwanted attention, she leaves. Her jeep breaks down on a dark, secluded country road, and as she starts to hike to the cabin, Cole pulls up in his truck and offers her a lift. He convinces her he is harmless, and when he extends an invitation to dinner the following night, Josie accepts. | As they linger over drinks after dinner, Josie discusses her unhappy marriage. Although there are problems, and she sometimes fantasizes about her husband's death, she is grateful to Tony for all he has given her and still has hopes for their future. Cole becomes aggressive and she resists his advances. During the drive back to the cabin, he turns off his headlights and begins to drive erratically, and Josie becomes hysterical. When he tries to force himself on her, Josie fires a gun she found in a kitchen drawer and grazes his face with the bullet. Vowing revenge, Cole leaves. | With the passing of time, Tony stops drinking and he and Josie successfully work at repairing their damaged marriage. On the way home one rainy night, he stops at an ATM, and Cole conceals himself in the back seat of his car. He forces him to drive to a secluded park and shoots him numerous times, then goes to Josie's home and reveals he has killed her husband. He warns her if she reports him to the police he will tell them she hired him to murder Tony, and demands $30,000 for his silence. When the police question Josie she says nothing about Cole's involvement, but her story - or lack of one - makes detective Dan Fredricks suspicious, and his African American partner Ron Lewis accuses him of suspecting Josie simply because she is black and her husband was white. | Josie tells her lover, struggling restaurateur Jake Golden, she knows the identity of Tony's killer, but he warns her not to reveal anything. He has an ulterior motive - Jake, desperate for money to finance his failing business when his partner - Tony - bailed out, had hired Cole to kill Tony so Josie would be free to marry him and he could benefit from her wealth. Complications arise when attorney Bill Adolphe tells Josie all her husband's assets were in his name and he died intestate. All his accounts have been frozen and Josie will have to wait an undetermined amount of time for the court to supervise probate. | While Jake's ex-wife Nora tries to convince the police he may have killed Tony, Josie becomes the target of the increasingly deranged Cole. After killing Jake, he traps her in her garage and Josie kills him in the ensuing skirmish. Josie pleads self defense, and when Nora tells them she doesn't believe Josie is clever enough to have masterminded any of the events that have transpired, the police let her go, unaware the two women are partners in crime.","m_cast":"Halle Berry as Josie Potenza | Peter Greene as Cole Wilson | Clive Owen as Jake Golden | Christopher McDonald as Tony Potenza | Frankie Faison as Detective Ron Lewis | Charles Hallahan as Detective Dan Fredricks | Clea Lewis as Nora Golden | Allan Rich as Bill Adolphe","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Amy Holden Jones","m_produced_by":"Julie Bergman Sender Roger Birnbaum","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Halle Berry Peter Greene Clive Owen Christopher McDonald","m_music_by":"John Frizzell Main theme by James Newton Howard","m_cinematography":"Haskell Wexler","m_edited_by":"Wendy Greene Bricmont Glenn Garland","m_production_company":"Hollywood Pictures Caravan Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 13, 1996","m_running_time":"95 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$8,543,587[1] | The Rich Man's Wife is a 1996 American thriller film written and directed by Amy Holden Jones, and starring Halle Berry.
