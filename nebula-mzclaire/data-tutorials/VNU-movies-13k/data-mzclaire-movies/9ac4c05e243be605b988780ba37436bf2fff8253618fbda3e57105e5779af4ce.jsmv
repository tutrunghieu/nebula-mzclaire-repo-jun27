{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong play versions of themselves being invited to Amsterdam for a film festival devoted to Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton. When Reynolds and Parton do not show up to the festival, the promoter goes to Cheech and Chong for help and the duo volunteers to give a live performance (even though they had not performed their live act for several years). For much of the film, they do versions of many of their recorded characters (with the exception of Pedro and the Man, whom they had already portrayed on film in Up in Smoke) and several new skits. The second half of the movie features their live performance, climaxing with a version of their infamous \"Ralph And Herbie\" routine.","m_cast":"Cheech Marin as Cheech | Tommy Chong as Chong \"Man\" | Hans Man in 't Veld as Promoter | Carol van Herwijnen as Hotel Manager | Shireen Strooker as Assistant Manager | Susan Hahn as Hotel Maid | Arjan Ederveen as Bellboy #1 | Kees Prins as Bellboy #2 | Mariette Bout as Barge Waitress | Fabiola as Barge Lady | Carla van Amstel as Queen Beatrix","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tommy Chong","m_produced_by":"Peter Macgregor-Scott","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Cheech Marin | Thomas Chong","m_music_by":"George S.
