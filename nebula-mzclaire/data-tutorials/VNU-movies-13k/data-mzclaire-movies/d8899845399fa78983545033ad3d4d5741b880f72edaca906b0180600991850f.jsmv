{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film follows the plot of the TV series SpongeBob SquarePants, focusing on the anthropomorphic sea sponge of the same name (Tom Kenny). SpongeBob dreams about managing the Krusty Krab restaurant, which is in trouble because a customer has no cheese on his Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob saves the day. He wakes up and cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for the Krusty Krab 2, hoping that his boss Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) will promote him to manager of the new restaurant built next door to the original Krusty Krab. At the ceremony, SpongeBob is passed over; his co-worker, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass), has been given the promotion because Mr. Krabs thinks he is \"more mature\" than SpongeBob. | Meanwhile, Plankton (Mr. Lawrence), Mr. Krabs' business rival, devises a plot to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and frame Mr. Krabs. He steals King Neptune's (Jeffrey Tambor) crown that night, leaving evidence that pins the crime on Mr. Krabs, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. That night, SpongeBob goes to his favorite restaurant, Goofy Goober's; he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend, Patrick Star (Bill Fagerbakke), waking up the next morning with a headache. King Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 the same morning and threatens to slay Mr. Krabs. Although SpongeBob criticizes Mr. Krabs shortly after he arrives, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Mr. Krabs, still certain that he is the culprit, and tells SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a Krabby Patty. | In Bikini Bottom, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, with the claim that Krabs bequeathed him the recipe. He sends a hitman named Dennis (Alec Baldwin) to pursue SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and tries to alert Neptune. However, Plankton uses mind-controlling bucket helmets disguised as souvenirs to control Bikini Bottom's residents, including Squidward, and renames the city Planktopolis. | Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick encounter a dangerous trench, but Neptune's daughter Mindy (Scarlett Johansson) helps them past it by making them think she can transform them into men. They are stopped by Dennis, who tries to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn stepped on by a massive \"cyclops\" (a diver) (Neil Ross). The \"cyclops\" grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and goes to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City. At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but are killed in a lethal drying-out process with the heat lamp turned on. Their tears short-circuit the heat lamp; its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving their bodies and the other dried sea creatures to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach. When they lose their way home, David Hasselhoff offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. | Back at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs. Just in time, SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown and confront Plankton, who then drops a mind-control bucket on Neptune, enslaving him. SpongeBob performs the song \"Goofy Goober Rock\" (performed by Jim Wise) and, after transforming into an electric guitar-wielding wizard for the duration of the song, he frees Bikini Bottom's residents. Plankton is arrested, and King Neptune thanks SpongeBob for his bravery and thaws Mr. Krabs, who makes SpongeBob manager of the Krusty Krab 2 in gratitude.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie earned $9,559,752 on its opening day in the United States, second behind Disney's National Treasure (which earned $11 million).[99][100] It grossed a combined total of $32,018,216 during its opening weekend, on 4,300 screens at 3,212 theaters, averaging $9,968 per venue (or $7,446 per screen,[101] again second to National Treasure).[101][102][103][104] The film dropped an unexpected 44 percent over the Thanksgiving weekend, and 57 percent the weekend after that.[105][106][107] The opening weekend earned 37.48 percent of the film's final gross.[105] It closed on March 24, 2005, failing to out-gross holiday animated competitors The Incredibles (from Disney-Pixar, grossing $261,441,092) and The Polar Express (Warner Bros., grossing $183,373,735). It was still profitable for distributor Paramount Pictures and producer Nickelodeon Movies, earning $85,417,988 in the United States and $140,161,792 worldwide on a budget of $30 million.[3] The film was the 29th-highest-grossing 2004 film domestically[108] and is the sixth-highest-grossing animated TV adaptation of all time.[109] | On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 68%, based on 125 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents.\"[110] Metacritic gave the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[111] According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[112] | All of this happens in jolly animation with bright colors and is ever so much more entertaining than you are probably imagining. No doubt right now you're asking yourself why you have read this far in the review, given the near-certainty that you will not be going anywhere near a SpongeBob SquarePants movie, unless you are the parent or adult guardian of a SpongeBob SquarePants fan, in which case your fate is sealed. Assuming that few members of SpongeBob's primary audience are reading this (or can read), all I can tell you is, the movie is likely to be more fun than you expect. | Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"the 'Good Burger' of animation ... plopping us down inside a fast-food war being fought by sponges, starfish, crabs, tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune.\"[113] Ed Park of The Village Voice wrote, \"No Pixar? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [The] SpongeBob SquarePants Movie has more yuks than Shark Tale and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express whole.\"[114] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it \"an animated adventure that's funnier than Shark Tale and more charming than The Polar Express.\"[115] Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said, \"Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation.\"[116] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of three out of four: \"It's not The Incredibles, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own.\"[117] Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars, calling it \"a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality.\"[118] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B-minus grade: \"The best moments in his [SpongeBob SquarePants] first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like, just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg.\"[119] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film: \"You gotta love SpongeBob. Coolest sponge in the sea, although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look.\"[120] | Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie retains the 2-D charm of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cartoon but adds a few tricks – a little 3-D here, a little David Hasselhoff there. The series' appeal never lay in its visuals, however. 'SpongeBob' endeared itself to kids and adults through sweetness and cleverness, also abundant here.\"[121] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave it a score of four out of five: \"If you're tired of ... bluster and swagger, SpongeBob is your man.\"[122] Tom Maurstad of The Dallas Morning News also gave the film a B-minus grade: \"Being so good is what led to making the movie, and it's also the reason that many small-screen episodes are better than this big-screen venture.\"[123] | Some reviews praised David Hasselhoff's appearance in the film. Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post wrote, \"Getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoff's back (and thighs, and calves) magnified exponentially is perhaps a bit creepy. Like the movie, it's all in good fun.\"[124] Nancy Basile of About.com, who gave the film four out of five stars, wrote that Hasselhoff \"must have a great sense of humor.\"[125] Cinema Blend founder Joshua Tyler called Hasselhoff's role \"the best movie cameo I've seen since Fred Savage stuck a joint in his crotch and played a clarinet to charm the resulting smoke like a snake.\"[126] | There's plenty to treasure in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, but for all the spit-and-polish animation and the rollicking soundtrack (which includes an original song by the Flaming Lips, as well as Ween's gorgeous \"Ocean Man,\" from their Mollusk album), this isn't the yellow one's most thrilling hour—or 80 minutes.\" | David Edelstein of Slate criticized the film's plot, calling it a \"big, heavy anchor of a story structure to weigh him down.\"[127] Mike Clark of USA Today called it \"harmlessly off-the-cuff — but facing far more pedigreed multiplex competition ... SpongeBob barely rates as OK when compared with The Incredibles.\"[128] A reviewer noted in Time Out London, \"Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.\"[129] In his Variety review, Todd McCarthy said the film \"takes on rather too much water during its extended feature-length submersion.\"[130] Internet Movie Database staff member David N. Butterworth gave it zero stars, saying that \"For much like fish, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie truly stinks.\"[131] | While the film was generally well received by fans of the show, it is considered a turning point in the show's history; many fans believe that the television series has declined in quality since the film's release.[132] While episodes aired before the film were praised for their \"uncanny brilliance\",[133] those aired after the film have been called \"kid-pandering attention-waster[s]\",[134] \"tedious\",[135] \"boring\", \"dreck\",[136] a \"depressing plateau of mediocrity\"[137] and \"laugh-skimpy.\"[138] After the film's release, fans \"began to turn away from the show,\" causing fansites to \"bec[ome] deserted.\"[132] Some fans believe that the show's 2012 ratings decline correlates with a decline in quality, and \"whatever fan support [the show] enjoys is not enough\" to save it from its slide in ratings.[132]","m_production":"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long-planned;[4] Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had approached series creator Stephen Hillenburg for a film based on the show, but he refused for more than a year.[5] Hillenburg was concerned, after watching The Iron Giant and Toy Story with his sons, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically-consequential and inspiring without losing what he calls the SpongeBob \"cadence.\"[5] He said, on a break from season-four post-production, \"To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think [...] This had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure. That's where the comedy's coming from, having these two naïve characters, SpongeBob and Patrick, a doofus and an idiot, on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all the odds against them.\"[5] | In 2002, Hillenburg and the show's staff stopped making episodes to work on the film after the show's third season.[6] The film's plot originally had SpongeBob rescue Patrick from a fisherman in Florida;[6] an obvious reference to the 2003 film, Finding Nemo, this was later said by Tom Kenny (the voice of SpongeBob) to be a \"joke\" plot to keep fans busy.[6] Hillenburg wrote the film with five other writer-animators from the show (Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne and Tim Hill) over a three-month period in a room of a former Glendale, California bank.[5] Osborne said, \"It was hugely fun [...] although it did get kind of gamy in there.\"[5] At the beginning of the series, Hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts (from Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton) and work by two modern comic actors: Jerry Lewis and Pee-wee Herman, both obvious inspirations for SpongeBob.[7] For the film, the writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface.[7] Bill Fagerbakke (the voice of Patrick) said about the plot, \"It's just nuts. I'm continually dazzled and delighted with what these guys came up with.\"[8] | When the film was completed, Hillenburg wanted to end the series \"so [it] wouldn't jump the shark\". However, Nickelodeon desired more episodes;[9] Hillenburg stated: \"Well, there was concern when we did the movie [in 2004] that the show had peaked. There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon.\"[10][11] As a result, Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner,[12] appointing supervising producer, writer, director, and storyboard artist Paul Tibbitt to succeed him.[13] Tibbitt was one of Hillenburg's favorite crew members:[14] \"[I] totally trusted him.\"[15] Tibbitt is still showrunner, and acts as an executive producer since 2008.[13][16] Hillenburg no longer writes or runs the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviews each episode and submits suggestions: \"I figure when I'm pretty old I can still paint [...] I don't know about running shows.\"[12][17] Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke and the crew confirmed that they had completed four episodes for broadcast on Nickelodeon in early 2005,[18][19] and planned to finish a total of about 20 for the fourth season.[18][19] | In September 2003, Jules Engel, Hillenburg's mentor when he studied experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, died.[20] Hillenburg dedicated the film to him: \"He truly was the most influential artistic person in my life. I consider him my 'Art Dad.'\"[21][22][23] | There were a number of stages involved in the making of the film, beginning with a rough animation process of ideas drawn on Post-it notes.[24] The writers drew, working from rough outlines rather than scripts (which made the humor more visual than verbal).[7] Hillenburg said, \"It's in the characters' extreme body language, in how they slither capriciously around the deadpan frames.\"[7] The storyboard artists, including Sherm Cohen, then illustrated ideas conceived by the writers.[8] In the series Tom Yasumi and Andrew Overtoom do the animatics, but director Hillenburg and writer Derek Drymon did the animatics for the film.[25] Yasumi and Overtoom were the film's animation-timing directors, concentrating on the sheets.[25] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was animated at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea.[4] The animators worked semi-digitally; pencil-drawn poses would be composited into layouts in Photoshop.[26] | Series writer and storyboard artist Erik Wiese left the show for a year to work on Samurai Jack and Danny Phantom, but returned to do storyboards and character layout for the film.[9] He \"always wanted to be a feature animator, and the movie felt like I was on the character animation end\", describing the experience as \"a blast—it felt like coming home.\"[9] | Hillenburg enjoyed the process of making the film:[6] \"The TV schedule is tight, and you don't always have a lot of time to work on your drawings.\"[6] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: \"I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show\", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release.[6] \"There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story.\"[6] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.[23] | The film features live-action scenes directed by Mark Osborne in Santa Monica, California.[8][27] The ship used during the 30-second opening featuring the pirates singing the theme was the Bounty,[28][29] a 180-foot (55 m)-long, enlarged reconstruction of the 1787 Royal Navy sailing ship HMS Bounty built for 1962's Mutiny on the Bounty. The ship has appeared in a number of other films, including Treasure Island (1999), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007).[30][31] In film trailers, live-action scenes were taken from Das Boot (1981), The Hunt for Red October (1990) and U-571 (2000).[6] | Baywatch and Knight Rider actor David Hasselhoff made a cameo in the live-action scenes, offering SpongeBob and Patrick a ride to Bikini Bottom.[32] The scene was originally written before consulting Hasselhoff.[18][19] Hillenburg was pleased with the storyboards;[9] Lead storyboard artist Sherm Cohen said, \"He had been wrestling with the ending for quite a while, and finally he was ready to pitch his ideas to some of the other board artists.\"[9] Hillenburg was counting on casting Hasselhoff, and the first question asked him was \"So, do we have Hasselhoff?\"[9] He replied \"No\", with a grin.[9] Hasselhoff eventually agreed, before seeing the script.[18][19] Hillenburg said about the actor, \"He's a great guy [...] He was great at making fun of himself.\"[18][19] | The crew built a 750-pound (340 kg), 12-foot (3.7 m) replica of Hasselhoff.[27][32][33] The $100,000 replica was kept at Hasselhoff's home;[34] he has said, \"It freaked me out because it was so lifelike, with teeth, when you touch it [it] feels like real skin. It's soft, like your skin.\"[34] At the completion of filming, Hasselhoff said, \"That's ridiculously awesome. What are you gonna do with it?\"[34] Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it, he answered, \"Uh, yeah. Okay.\"[34] Hasselhoff filmed in cold water, where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea;[8][32] he described the experience as \"cold but [a] lot of fun.\"[24] | In late March 2014, Hasselhoff auctioned off the replica with other memorabilia collected during his career. Julien's Auctions handled the item's sale, which were expected to bring in between $20,000 and $30,000. The auction was scheduled to begin on April 11.[35][36] | The film stars the series' main cast members, Tom Kenny as SpongeBob SquarePants, Bill Fagerbakke as Patrick Star, Rodger Bumpass as Squidward Tentacles, Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs, Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks and Mr. Lawrence as Plankton. It also features Jill Talley as Karen, Mary Jo Catlett as Mrs. Puff, Lori Alan as Pearl, Dee Bradley Baker as Perch Perkins, Carlos Alazraqui as King Neptune's squire, Aaron Hendry as the Cyclops and Neil Ross as the voice of the Cyclops. In addition to the series' cast, it was reported on March 23, 2004 that Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor and Alec Baldwin would play new characters Mindy, King Neptune and Dennis, respectively, and David Hasselhoff would appear as himself.[37][38] | Johansson accepted the role because she likes cartoons and was a fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show.[39] When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, \"This is me.\"[39] He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi: \"My first cartoon, I had to be carried out crying [...] It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'\"[40] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin;[38] Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a \"phone\":[39] \"I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, it was like he was in another booth in the studio.\"[39] | Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff accepted the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him:[41] \"I got an offer to do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie and I turned to my girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, 'Who's SpongeBob?' and they said, 'Oh my God, Dad, it's the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.'\"[41] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: \"It was great fun and to this day around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture.\"[41] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: \"It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans.\"[41] | Gregor Narholz composed the score for the film,[42][43][44] conducting the recording sessions (in 5.1 surround sound) with the London Metropolitan Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London.[45][46] Narholz was signed when series music editor Nick Carr recommended him to Hillenburg after they worked together at the Associated Production Music library.[9] Narholz was honored at the 2005 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards for his work on the film,[47] and received a nomination for Music in an Animated Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards.[48][49] | American rock band The Flaming Lips recorded \"SpongeBob & Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy\".[50][51] They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas.[50] Coyne said, \"Stephen [Hillenburg] seems to be a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s [...] He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then.\"[50] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused;[52] according to Coyle, \" ... but [Stephen Hillenburg] said, 'I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween.'\"[52] American band Wilco wrote and recorded \"Just a Kid\".[51][53] One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco.[53] Tweedy said, \"I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness at the bottom of the sea as 'advanced darkness' [...] How could I not write a song for this film? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block.\"[53] Avril Lavigne recorded the series' theme for the soundtrack.[54][55][56] Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Motörhead, singing \"You Better Swim\" (a derivative of their 1992 song \"You'd Better Run\");[57][58][59] Prince Paul (\"Prince Paul's Bubble Party\");[57] Ween (\"Ocean Man\"),[57] and the Shins (\"They'll Soon Discover\", partially written in 2001).[60] | \"The Best Day Ever\", written by Tom Kenny (SpongeBob's voice actor) and Andy Paley, was featured in the film and on its soundtrack. Kenny and Paley were working on what would become the album The Best Day Ever, writing \"The Best Day Ever\" and \"Under My Rock\".[61] The film's production team needed two more tracks for the soundtrack;[61] Hillenburg heard the songs, and decided to include them.[61] \"The Best Day Ever\" ended up being played during the film's closing credits.[61] | The DVD and Blu-ray releases include animatics of deleted scenes from the film, including SpongeBob and Patrick's meeting with Sandy Cheeks (a squirrel) on the surface after their escape from Shell City.[62] Patrick repeatedly vomits, upset by Sandy's unusual appearance.[62] The squirrel is pursued by black-suited exterminators,[62] and defends herself with acorns.[62] She informs SpongeBob and Patrick that they can return to Bikini Bottom by taking a bus at the beach.[62] | When SpongeBob awakens with a hangover on the Goofy Goober party boat, he asks a waiter for a \"Double-Fudge Spinny\";[62] the rejected line was used in a tie-in book, Ice-Cream Dreams, which was based on the film.[62] In 2013 the film's lead storyboard artist, Sherm Cohen, released a storyboard panel of a deleted scene from the film with SpongeBob awakening from his dream saying \"WEEEEE!\" and Mr. Krabs holding a manager's hat.[63][64]","m_sequel":"On February 28, 2012, the production of a sequel was announced; it would be directed by Paul Tibbitt, written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger and produced by Stephen Hillenburg[160] for a late-2014 release.[161][162][163] On August 1, 2013, Paramount changed the sequel's release date to February 13, 2015.[164][165][166] It was announced in early June 2014 that the film would instead be released on February 6, 2015, to avoid competition with Universal Pictures' Fifty Shades of Grey, which was set for a February 13, 2015 release.[167] A third film has been announced and has a release date of February 8, 2019.","m_based_on":"SpongeBob SquarePants  by Stephen Hillenburg","m_directed_by":"Stephen Hillenburg[1]","m_produced_by":"Stephen Hillenburg | Julia Pistor","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tom Kenny | Bill Fagerbakke | Clancy Brown | Rodger Bumpass | Mr. Lawrence | Alec Baldwin | David Hasselhoff | Scarlett Johansson | Jeffrey Tambor","m_music_by":"Gregor Narholz","m_cinematography":"Jerzy Zielinski","m_edited_by":"Lynn Hobson","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"November 14, 2004 (2004-11-14) (Grauman's Chinese Theatre) | November 19, 2004 (2004-11-19) (North America) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"88 minutes[2]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$30 million[3]","m_box_office":"$140.2 million[3] | The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (also known as The SpongeBob Movie for short) is a 2004 American animated/live-action comedy film based on the Nickelodeon television series, SpongeBob SquarePants. The film was directed by series creator Stephen Hillenburg, and stars the regular television cast of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, and Mr. Lawrence, with guest performances by Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, Alec Baldwin and David Hasselhoff. The plot follows Plankton's plan to steal King Neptune's crown and send it to Shell City. SpongeBob and Patrick must retrieve the crown to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and their home (Bikini Bottom) from Plankton's plan. | Previous offers by Paramount Pictures to create a film version of SpongeBob were rejected by Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one in 2002. When the film went into production, Hillenburg and the show's staff halted production on the series after the third season. A writing team—Hillenburg, Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne and Tim Hill—was assembled, conceiving the idea of a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended as the series finale; however, Nickelodeon desired more episodes, so Paul Tibbitt assumed Hillenburg's position as showrunner to produce further episodes after the movie. During production, Jules Engel, Hillenburg's mentor at the California Institute of the Arts, died; the film was dedicated to his memory. | Tie-in promotions were made by 7-Eleven, the Cayman Islands and Burger King, which decorated some stores with 9-foot (2.7 m) SpongeBob inflatable figures. The film was a box-office success, grossing over $140 million with a $30 million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics. A stand-alone sequel titled The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was released on February 6, 2015, and a third film is expected to be released on February 8, 2019. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Detail view of Movies Page\". afi.com.
