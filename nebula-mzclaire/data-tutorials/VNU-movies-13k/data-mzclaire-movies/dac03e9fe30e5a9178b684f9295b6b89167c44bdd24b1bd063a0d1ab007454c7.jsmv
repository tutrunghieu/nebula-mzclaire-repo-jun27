{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After tying for the win in New York's \"Drag Queen of the Year\" contest, Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) and Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) win a trip to Hollywood to take part in the even bigger \"Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant.\" Before they depart, Vida persuades Noxeema to take along the inexperienced \"drag princess\" Chi-Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) as their protégé (they initially refer to him simply as a \"boy in a dress\" rather than as a fully-fledged drag queen). To do this, they trade in their airplane tickets for cash and buy a stylish but old Cadillac convertible with money given to them by John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt (Robin Williams). They set off for Los Angeles in it, carrying with them an iconic autographed photo of Julie Newmar (signed, \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\") that Vida purloined from a restaurant wall. | While on the road they are pulled over by the racist, homophobic (yet possibly closeted), and sexist Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn), who tries to rape Vida. He discovers Vida is not a woman and, in the commotion, he falls backwards and is knocked unconscious. They think he is dead, hurry off, and leave him behind. As they recover from the incident at a rest stop, their car breaks down. A young man, Bobby Ray (Jason London) from the nearby small town of Snydersville, happens to pass by and gives them a ride, where they take refuge in a bed and breakfast inn owned by Carol Ann (Stockard Channing) and her abusive car repairman husband, Virgil (Arliss Howard). | They become stranded in the town for the weekend as they wait for the replacement part for their car to arrive. Chi-Chi is harassed by a group of roughnecks, but is saved by Bobby Ray. While volunteering to help with the town's Strawberry Social, they decide its small band of women need a day with them, which consists of the following steps: get your hair done, pick out a new outfit, and then just sit in a cafe and talk. While searching for the new outfits, they are ecstatic to find vintage fashions from the 1960s in the town's clothing store and give the female residents (and themselves) a make-over. | Following their makeover, they are abused by the same roughnecks that attempted to attack Chi-Chi. Fed up, Noxeema handles the situation in a typically New York manner and teaches their ringleader a lesson in manners. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi do what they can to be positive, and they set out to improve the lives of the townspeople, including offering assistance in organizing the Strawberry Social. | Meanwhile, Sheriff Dollard is ridiculed by his colleagues, who believe he was beat up by a girl. He goes off in search of the drag queens. | Vida, in the meantime, becomes acutely aware of Carol Ann's abuse at the hands of Virgil and, shortly thereafter, they overhear him giving her another beating. Vida decides to intervene and beats him up before throwing him out of the house. | Carol Ann is able to repair their car, but they remain for the Strawberry Social. Carol Ann reveals to Vida that she knew she was a drag queen all along due to her Adam's apple, which is less prominent in women. | No too far away, Virgil runs into Sheriff Dollard at a bar and they realize that the newcomers are the same people Dollard has been searching for. They head back to Snydersville, and Dollard demands that the townspeople turn them over. The other townspeople, who now realize that their new friends are not women, begin to protect them. One by one they step up and confront Dollard, each one claiming to be a drag queen (in similar fashion as in Spartacus). He is humiliated and flees. The Strawberry Social commences with everyone dressed in vibrant red outfits for it. They then say goodbye to their new friends as they prepare to leave. In honor of their friendship, Vida gives Carol Ann the autographed photo of Julie Newmar that has accompanied them on their trip. | They eventually make it to Los Angeles where Chi-Chi, after having received many tips from Vida and Noxeema during their ordeal, wins the title of Drag Queen of the Year. Fittingly, the crown is presented by Julie Newmar herself.","m_cast":"Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson | Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme | John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez | Stockard Channing as Carol Ann | Blythe Danner as Beatrice | Arliss Howard as Virgil | Jason London as Bobby Ray | Chris Penn as Sheriff Dollard | Melinda Dillon as Merna | Beth Grant as Loretta | Alice Drummond as Clara | Michael Vartan as Tommy | Jennifer Milmore as Bobbie Lee | Julie Newmar as Herself | Naomi Campbell as Girl at China Bowl restaurant | Joseph Arias as Joey Arias | Daniel T. \"Sweetie\" Boothe as Pageant Hostess | Lady Catiria as Herself | Laritza Dumont as Herself | Alexander Heimberg as Miss Understood | Candis Cayne as Herself (credited as Brendan McDanniel) | Clinton Leupp as Miss Coco Peru | Steven Polito as Hedda Lettuce | Jon Ingle as The Lady Bunny | Quentin Crisp as NY Pageant Judge | Flotilla DeBarge as NY Pageant Judge | Jose Sarria as NY Pageant Judge | RuPaul as Rachel Tensions | Robin Williams as John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt","m_reception":"The film received mixed reviews from critics, as it holds a 41% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews but has since become a cult film.","m_production":"The opening and closing scenes were filmed in New York City featuring dozens of its local drag performers and underground stars in small roles or as featured extras.
