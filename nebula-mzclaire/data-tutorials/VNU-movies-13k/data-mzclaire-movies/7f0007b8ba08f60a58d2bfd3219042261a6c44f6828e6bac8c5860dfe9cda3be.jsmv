{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) dreams of being a world-famous news anchor. To that end, she marries Larry Maretto (Matt Dillon), due to mutal attraction and because she believes his family business will keep her financially comfortable, and she starts attempting to climb the network news ladder, beginning as a meteorologist at a local cable station, WWEN. | When Larry starts asking her to take off from her career to start a family, she immediately begins plotting to get rid of him. To this end, she uses the subjects of her TV documentary, a high school project called \"Teens Speak Out,\" and seduces one of her students, Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix), and manipulates him and his friends, delinquent Russell Hines (Casey Affleck) and shy Lydia Mertz (Alison Folland), into killing Larry. With the help of Russell and Lydia, Jimmy ultimately commits the murder. | Though Larry's death is ruled a burglary-murder, the police begin investigating when they stumble across a \"Teens Speak Out\" video of Suzanne at Jimmy's school in which Jimmy discreetly hints at a relationship with Suzanne. Jimmy, Russell and Lydia are arrested. Lydia makes a deal with the police to converse with Suzanne while wearing a wiretap, and Suzanne unwittingly reveals her hand in the murder. Despite this undeniable proof of Suzanne's guilt, however, she is acquitted in court, on the basis that the police had resorted to entrapment, and walks free. Suzanne basks in the media spotlight as she talks to reporters about Larry's death, and fabricates a story about her husband being a drug addict and being murdered by Jimmy and Russell as his dealers. | Jimmy and Russell are sentenced to life in prison, though Russell appeals against his sentence and receives sixteen years instead, while Lydia is released on probation for her cooperation. | Larry's father, Joe (Dan Hedaya), sees Suzanne lying about Larry on television, and realizes that Suzanne was behind his son's murder. He then uses his Mafia connections to have her murdered. The hitman (David Cronenberg) lures Suzanne away from her home by pretending to be interested in broadcasting her life story, kills her, and then buries her under a frozen lake. In a final irony, Lydia gains national attention by telling her side of the story in a television interview, becoming a celebrity. | Ultimately, Larry's sister, Janice (Illeana Douglas), practices her figure skating on the frozen lake where Suzanne's corpse is hidden, thus literally dancing on her hated sister-in-law's grave and looking down at her, as Suzanne had done of her.","m_cast":"Nicole Kidman as Suzanne Stone-Maretto | Matt Dillon as Larry Maretto | Joaquin Phoenix as Jimmy Emmett | Casey Affleck as Russell Hines | Illeana Douglas as Janice Maretto | Alison Folland as Lydia Mertz | Dan Hedaya as Joe Maretto | Wayne Knight as Ed Grant | Kurtwood Smith as Earl Stone | Holland Taylor as Carol Stone | Susan Traylor as Fay Stone | Maria Tucci as Angela Maretto | Tim Hopper as Mike Warden | Michael Rispoli as Ben DeLuca | Buck Henry as Mr. H.
