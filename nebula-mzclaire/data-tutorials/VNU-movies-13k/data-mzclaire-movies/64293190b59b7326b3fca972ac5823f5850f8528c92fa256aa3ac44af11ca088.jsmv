{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Haughty anthropology professor Harry Ballard (Karl Urban) receives a sinister videotape showing a cult called the Black Lodge ranting about a demonic plot. As it turns out, Harry's brother, Richard, killed himself a few months earlier under mysterious circumstances, possibly related to this cult; in any event, the loss has been preying on Harry's mind, sending his relationship with his girlfriend (Sally Stockwell) into a tailspin. Meanwhile, a seemingly schizophrenic young woman named Benny (Katie Wolfe), who has a penchant for lighting sparklers in alleyways for no good reason, follows Harry around and snatches him from the jaws of doom after he falls into the cult's hands. The devilish leader, Le Valliant (Jonathan Hendry), apparently has big plans in store for Harry, and soon the protagonist's grip on reality slips as the cult targets him for an upcoming ritual.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Glenn Standring","m_produced_by":"Dave Gibson | Chris Tyson","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Karl Urban | Katie Wolfe | Jonathon Hendry | Sally Stockwell","m_music_by":"Victoria Kelly | Joost Langeveld","m_cinematography":"Simon Baumfield","m_edited_by":"Paul Sutorius","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"May 2000 (2000-05) (Cannes Film Market) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"90 minutes","m_country":"New Zealand","m_language":"English | The Irrefutable Truth about Demons is a New Zealand horror film released in 2000.
