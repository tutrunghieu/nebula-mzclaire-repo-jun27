{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"While on vacation in Scotland, Sally Morton (Barbara Stanwyck) learns that her lover, the painter Geoffrey Carroll (Humphrey Bogart), is already married. Before returning home to his pre-teen daughter, Beatrice (Ann Carter), and his ill wife, Geoffrey buys a package from chemist Horace Blagdon (Barry Bernard). Geoffrey is painting his wife's portrait, depicting her as an \"angel of death.\" | Two years pass and Geoffrey's first wife has died, leaving him free to marry Sally. Although Geoffrey's career is doing well, lately he has been unable to paint anything of quality. Sally, the new Mrs. Carroll, entertains her old boyfriend, Charles \"Penny\" Pennington (Patrick O'Moore), and some wealthy American guests—which includes the icy but beautiful Cecily Latham (Alexis Smith). Geoffrey begins painting Cecily's portrait, and becomes romantically involved with her. Sally becomes aware of her husband's illicit romance. Several weeks pass, and Sally has fallen ill, recovered, and fallen ill again several times. The bumbling, alcoholic local physician, Dr. Tuttle (Nigel Bruce), believes she is recovering. | In an idle conversation with Beatrice, Sally discovers that the \"first Mrs. Carroll\" suffered from a series of illnesses very similar to her own. She also learns that Geoffrey has lied extensively about his first wife. Meanwhile, Geoffrey is being blackmailed by Blagdon, the chemist. Sally suspects that Geoffrey is gradually poisoning her via her nightly glasses of milk. Geoffrey murder Blagdon to end the blackmail. Sally enters Geoffrey's studio, and sees that he is painting her as an \"angel of death\" as well. That night, during a terrific thunderstorm, Sally disposes of her nightly glass of milk rather than drinking it. But Geoffrey learns of her deception, and inspired by newspaper articles about a local strangler, goes outside into the rain and then breaks into his own wife's bedroom to strangle her. At the last moment, Penny and the police arrive and save Sally from Geoffrey.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"\"Martin Vale\" was the pseudonym of Marguerite Vale Veiller, the wife of writer Bayard Veiller.[3] Her play, The Two Mrs. Carrolls, opened in London in 1935.[4] The play (now rewritten) moved to Broadway in 1943, where it was a minor hit. | Actress Elisabeth Bergner won high praise for the role of Sally Morton Carroll. During the play's run, a shy girl showed up at the stage door night after night to speak with Bergner. Bergner eventually became a mentor to the girl, sponsored her career in the theater, and won her a role as an understudy in The Two Mrs. Carrolls. The girl eventually undercut Bergner's career. The incident became the basis for the short story \"The Wisdom of Eve\" (1946) by Mary Orr, which was adapted for the movie All About Eve (1950).[5] | In the summer of 1944, Warner Brothers paid $225,000 for the film rights to the play. Although no screenwriter had been assigned to adapt the play for film, Warners announced that Bette Davis would star in the Sally Carroll role and Jesse L. Lasky would produce.[6] Meanwhile, Warners also purchased the rights to the Ayn Rand novel, The Fountainhead. The studio hired Mervyn LeRoy to direct, and announced that Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck would star in it.[7] | Veiller and Vale's play was significantly altered for the film. In the play, the first Mrs. Carroll is not murdered in the first act but rather lives (off-stage) until the third act. She telephones Sally to warn her that Geoffrey is attempting to poison her. This provides a major shock to the audience, which had no reason to suspect Geoffrey. In the screenplay, the first Mrs. Carroll dies (off-screen) minutes into the film. Suspense replaces shock, as Sally slowly begins to suspect her husband of murder.[8] William Faulkner worked on an early treatment of the play.[9] | Some time in the latter half of 1944, Warners announced that Ida Lupino and Zachary Scott would star in The Two Mrs. Carrolls.[2] On November 12, however, the studio said Barbara Stanwyck would star alongside Paul Henreid, and that Robert Buckner would produce the film.[10] Then on February 9, 1945, the studio announced that it was placing its production of The Fountainhead on hold due to the high cost and unavailability of materials to construct the large architectural sets for the film. The studio also announced it had recast The Two Mrs. Carrolls with Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck.[2] | According to Stanwyck biographer Axel Madsen, Stanwyck agreed to do the film out of boredom. Stanwyck's husband, Robert Taylor, was serving in the U.S. military in World War II. Although the war in Europe was clearly ending, Stanwyck knew Taylor would not return to the United States for many months.[8] However, another reason Stanwyck agreed to do the film is that she was close friends with director Peter Godfrey. They met while Stanwyck starred in the Christmas comedy Christmas in Connecticut in 1945, which Godfrey directed. Stanwyck became close friends with Godfrey and his wife.[11] | The Two Mrs. Carrolls was Stanwyck's second film with Godfrey,[11] Stanwyck biographer Dan Callahan has argued that Stanwyck's friendship with Godfrey blinded her to his shortcomings as a director,[12] which were significant.[13] Film historian Edmund Bansak notes that The Two Mrs. Carrolls was written as a vehicle for Stanwyck, which may also explain her willingness to star in the picture.[14] (Bogart biographer Richard Gehman challenges this claim. He says the rights to the play were purchased so that Bogart could star in the film adaptation.)[15] | Although the studio assigned a B movie director and producer, it hired A-list stars and the film had an A-list budget.[14] Filming began in April 1945, and ended in June.[16] Filming was almost all on sets at the Warner Bros. studio. Warners' veteran set designer, Anton Grot, designed the interiors of the Carroll mansion in England.[17] Painter John Decker produced the two portraits used in the film.[18] Humphrey Bogart wed Lauren Bacall on May 21, 1945 during the production. There was a brief hiatus in the production to accommodate their honeymoon.[19] | Bogart and Stanwyck had a friendly relationship on set. Producer Mark Hellinger, whom Bogart liked very much, announced that Bogart would not be seen in any painter's wardrobe which would appear unmasculine. When a painter's smock and beret with a tassle showed up on his wardrobe clothes rack one day, the actor was furious. The smock and beret were a joke perpetrated by Stanwyck, and the two performers had a good laugh afterward.[20] | Warner Bros. did not immediately release The Two Mrs. Carrolls. Rationales vary widely for the delay. Turner Classic Movies reviewer Jeremy Arnold concludes that this was because the film had a strong similarity to the 1944 film Gaslight.[21] But film historian Richard Schickel says that it was because Warners hoped that Bogart's rising popularity as a Hollywood star would help overcome his awful performance in The Two Mrs. Carrolls.[22] The studio was also unhappy that, in 1946, the song \"Open the Door, Richard\" had become a popular song, with five versions released in 1946 and 1947. The studio considered cutting or refilming the scene in which Bogart pounds on Stanwyck's bedroom door, demanding that she open it. But the scene stayed.[23] | The Two Mrs. Carrolls was finally released in the United States on March 4, 1947.[24] The studio had a relatively poor marketing campaign for the picture. Theater owners were asked to promote the film by holding contests in which female patrons were to decide whether they looked more like female lead Barbara Stanwyck or Alexis Smith.[25]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the 1935 play Two Mrs. Carrolls  by Martin Vale","m_directed_by":"Peter Godfrey","m_produced_by":"Mark Hellinger","m_screenplay_by":"Thomas Job","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Humphrey Bogart Barbara Stanwyck Alexis Smith Nigel Bruce","m_music_by":"Franz Waxman","m_cinematography":"J.
