Though banned by the Chinese government upon its completion (along with a ten-year ban on filmmaking imposed on Tian),[1] the film soon found a receptive international audience. Along with Zhang Yimou's To Live and Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine, The Blue Kite serves as one of the quintessential examples of China's Fifth Generation filmmaking, and in particular reveals the impact the various political movements, including Anti-Rightist Movement and Cultural Revolution, had upon directors who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. | The film won the Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Film Festival, and Best Film at the Hawaii International Film Festival, both in 1993. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ James Mudge. \"Banned in China\".
