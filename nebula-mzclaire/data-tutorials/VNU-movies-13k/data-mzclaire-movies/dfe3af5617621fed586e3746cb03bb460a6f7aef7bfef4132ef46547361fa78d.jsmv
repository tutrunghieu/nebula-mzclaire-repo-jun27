{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Alice Howland, a linguistics professor at Columbia University, celebrates her 50th birthday with her physician husband John and three adult children. After she forgets a word during a lecture and becomes lost during a jog on campus, Alice's doctor diagnoses her with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Alice's eldest daughter, Anna, tests positive for the Alzheimer's gene. Anna's unborn twins test negative, as does Alice's son Tom. Alice's younger daughter, aspiring actress Lydia, decides not to be tested. | As Alice's memory begins to fade, she daydreams of her mother and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of personal questions on her phone, which she answers every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self to commit suicide with the pills when she can no longer answer the questions. As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for the bathroom in her own home and wets herself, and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play. | John is offered a job at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Alice asks him to postpone it, but he feels this is impossible. At her doctor's suggestion, Alice delivers a speech at an Alzheimer's conference about her experience with the disease, using a highlighter to remind herself which parts of the speech she has already spoken, and receives a standing ovation. | Alice begins to have difficulty answering her phone questions. She loses the phone, causing her anxiety; John finds it a month later in the freezer, but Alice thinks it was only missing for a day. She visits Anna in the hospital to meet her newborn twin grandchildren, but does not recognize her daughter. | After a video call with Lydia, Alice inadvertently opens the video with the suicide instructions. With some difficulty, she finds the pills and is about to swallow them, but when she is interrupted by the arrival of her caregiver she drops the pills on the floor, quickly forgetting her suicide plan. | John resolves to move to Minnesota and Lydia moves back from California to care for Alice. Lydia reads her a section of the play Angels in America and asks her what she thinks it is about. Alice, now barely able to speak, responds with a single word: love.","m_cast":"Julianne Moore as Alice Daly-Howland[6] | Alec Baldwin as John Howland | Kristen Stewart as Lydia Howland | Kate Bosworth as Anna Howland-Jones | Hunter Parrish as Tom Howland | Shane McRae as Charlie Jones | Stephen Kunken as Dr. Benjamin | Victoria Cartagena as Professor Hooper | Seth Gilliam as Frederic Johnson | Daniel Gerroll as Eric Wellman | Erin Darke as Jenny | Kristin Macomber as Anne | Caridad Montanez as Elena","m_reception":"As of 2016, Still Alice has a domestic gross of $18.7 million and internationally $25 million.[2] | Still Alice premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews, with emphasis on Julianne Moore's performance. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 88% based on 169 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Elevated by a gripping performance from Julianne Moore, Still Alice is a heartfelt drama that honors its delicate themes with bravery and sensitivity.\"[16] On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a score of 72 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[17] The National Board of Review Awards named Still Alice as one of the top ten independent films of 2014.[18] | Peter Debruge of Variety wrote in a positive review that the film had been shot \"in such a way that activity is constantly spilling beyond the edges of the frame, giving the impression that characters’ lives continue when they’re not on camera, even as Alice’s seems to be closing in around her. Just as her kids look for ever-fainter signs of their mother behind those eyes, we lean in to watch Moore the actress turn invisible within her own skin.\"[19] | Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \"warm, compassionate, but bitingly honest\" and asserted that Moore had a \"career-high performance.\" Young also praised the direction of the film, noting that \"the directors tackle a subject where a restrained, understated approach is the best insurance against sloppy sentimentality. It pays off handsomely in the film’s closing moments, a poignant, poetic confrontation between the generations that draws the best from Moore and reveals unexpected depth in Stewart.\"[20] | Gregory Ellwood of Hitfix praised Moore: \"In each scene she peels a little bit more of Alice away as the emotional pain of the disease takes its toll...\" Ellwood also praised the direction, stating, \"The duo behind the critically acclaimed Quinceañera let the film's narrative unspool in as restrained a manner as possible. There are no unbelievable hysterics. There are no self-aware screaming matches.\"[21] | Tim Grierson of Screen International praised the understated direction and Moore's performance, as well as Baldwin, Stewart, and Bosworth's supporting work: \"Baldwin is particularly good as an ambitious medical researcher who is losing not just his wife but also a woman who was as driven as he was.\" Grierson added, \"With nuance, Bosworth and Stewart both play women who seem to have been profoundly shaped by their impressive mother, and we feel the characters’ confusion at having her influence suddenly ripped away from them (Stewart especially shines, initially playing a prototypical starving-artist type who surprises her family by her response to Alice’s diagnosis).\"[22]","m_production":"The film was produced by Lex Lutzus and James Brown of Lutzus/Brown along with Pamela Koffler of Killer Films and Marie Savare.
