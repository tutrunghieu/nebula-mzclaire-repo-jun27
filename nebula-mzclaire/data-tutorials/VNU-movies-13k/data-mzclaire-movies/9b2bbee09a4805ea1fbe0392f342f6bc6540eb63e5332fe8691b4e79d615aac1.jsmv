Listed as No. 5 and No. 6 respectively. Roger Ebert commented, \"The official East Coast line on John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday was that it is civilized. That judgment was enlisted to carry the critical defense of the movie; and, indeed, how can the decent critic be against a civilized movie about civilized people? My notion, all the same, is that Sunday Bloody Sunday is about people who suffer from psychic amputation, not civility, and that this film is not an affirmation but a tragedy...I think 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a masterpiece, but I don't think it's about what everybody else seems to think it's about. This is not a movie about the loss of love, but about its absence.\"","m_production":"Alan Bates was the original choice made by John Schlesinger for the role of Daniel Hirsh, the gay doctor. However he was held up filming The Go-Between (1970) and was replaced first by Ian Bannen, who dropped out after two weeks' filming, and later by Peter Finch. However, the role of Daniel was written as that of a much younger man. | Several actresses (including Dame Edith Evans and Thora Hird) politely refused the part of Glenda Jackson's mother, Mrs. Greville, because they thought the project was too risqué. Peggy Ashcroft accepted after the director explained to her the elements of the story and she gladly signed on. | Ian Bannen was fired from the role of Daniel Hirsh shortly after filming began. Apparently, he was so nervous about what kissing another actor on screen might do to his career, he could not concentrate enough to even get going with the part. He later said that losing the role set back his career, and regretted it till his death. | Actor Daniel Day-Lewis made his film debut at the age of 14 in this film as a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as \"heaven\", for getting paid £2 to vandalize expensive cars parked outside his local church.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Schlesinger","m_produced_by":"Joseph Janni Edward Joseph","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Murray Head Glenda Jackson Peter Finch Peggy Ashcroft","m_music_by":"Ron Geesin","m_cinematography":"Billy Williams","m_edited_by":"Richard Marden","m_production_company":"Vectia","m_distributed_by":"United Artists","m_release_dates":"1 July 1971 (1971-07-01) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | Sunday Bloody Sunday is a 1971 British drama film written by Penelope Gilliatt, directed by John Schlesinger and starring Murray Head, Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch. It tells the story of a free-spirited young bisexual artist (played by Head) and his simultaneous relationships with a female recruitment consultant (Jackson) and a male Jewish doctor (Finch). | The film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality. In this sense, Sunday Bloody Sunday was a considerable departure from Schlesinger's previous film Midnight Cowboy, which had portrayed its gay characters as alienated and self-loathing, as well as other gay-themed films of the era, including Boys in the Band, and Some of My Best Friends Are.... | The film was released before the 1972 shooting by the British Army of unarmed protesters in Derry, Northern Ireland, an event dubbed \"Bloody Sunday.\" |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Sunday Bloody Sunday at Rotten Tomatoes","m_external_link":"Sunday Bloody Sunday at the Internet Movie Database | Sunday Bloody Sunday at AllMovie | Sunday Bloody Sunday at Rotten Tomatoes","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Sundaybloodysunday.jpg/220px-Sundaybloodysunday.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Penelope Gilliatt"}
