Film director Michael Tully argued that the timing of the film's release during the U.S. invasion of Iraq makes the film's depiction of young American hedonism \"one of the more unintentionally brilliant statements of hypocrisy of the decade\" and the film itself \"a disturbingly relevant historical document\".[2] | The film was released to movie theaters only a month after filming was completed,[1] and was released on DVD and home video only a couple of months after that,[3] marking one of the fastest turnarounds ever from production to theatrical release to home video. The movie is also notable as one of the first American mainstream, major studio releases to show non-simulated intercourse between \"cast members,\" although nothing explicit is shown on screen. The DVD release contained additional footage, but the producers chose not to include any explicitly pornographic images. | The movie took in $3,825,000 domestically and $1,520,000 internationally, coming well short of its $7,500,000 production cost.[4] The initial DVD release that followed was, in turn, followed in 2005 by an extended edition DVD that included extra footage. | Some early media reports suggested that this film was a theatrical spin-off of The Real World reality series, also produced by Bunim-Murray Productions, but in fact there was no direct link between the two productions. | Most of the film's cast returned to general obscurity after the movie was released, with the exception of Laura Ramsey who launched an acting career. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b The Real Cancun Review - Read Variety's Analysis Of The Movie The Real Cancun | ^ Tully, Michael. \"Films of the decade: 'The Real Cancun'\".
