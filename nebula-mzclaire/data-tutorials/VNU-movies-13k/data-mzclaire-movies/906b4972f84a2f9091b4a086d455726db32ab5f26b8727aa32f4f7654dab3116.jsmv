{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Ben Quick is on trial, suspected of barn-burning, but when no solid evidence is found, the peace judge expels him from town. Ben then hitches a ride to Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, with two young women in a convertible, Clara Varner and her sister-in-law Eula (Lee Remick). Clara's father, Will Varner, is the domineering owner of most of the town. | Ben goes to the Varner plantation. Will is away, but Jody, Will's only son, agrees to let him become a sharecropper on a vacant farm. When Will returns from a stay in the hospital, he begins to see in Ben a younger version of himself and comes to admire his ruthlessness and ambition, qualities that Jody lacks. Will is also disappointed with the man that his 23-year-old daughter, Clara, has been seeing for five or six years: Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson), a genteel Southern \"blue blood\" and a mama's boy. Will therefore schemes to push his daughter and Ben together, to try to bring fresh, virile blood into the family. However, she is openly hostile to the crude, if magnetic, upstart. Will is determined to have his bloodline go on, so he offers Ben much wealth to marry Clara. Ben is interested, but eventually comes to see something more in Clara. Meanwhile, Minnie Littlejohn (Angela Lansbury), Will's long-time mistress, is dissatisfied with the arrangement and wants to marry him. Will, a widower, is strongly against the idea. | Jody becomes increasingly alarmed and frustrated when he sees his position in the family undermined by Ben. After Ben manages to sell some wild horses, Will offers him the position of clerk in the general store, alongside Jody. Later, Will invites him to live in the family mansion. | This is the final straw for Jody. When he finds Ben alone, he pulls a gun on him and threatens to kill him. Ben talks his way out by telling Jody about buried Civil War-era treasure he has supposedly found on a property that Will gave him, a down payment to seal their bargain over Clara. Ben and Jody head to the property, where they start digging. When the two men find a bag of coins, Jody is elated, thinking he might finally get free of his father's domination; he buys the land from Ben. Late that night, Will finds his son, still digging. After examining one of the coins, Will notices that it was minted in 1910. Jody is shattered. | Meanwhile, Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan his intentions, and does not like what she hears. The following day, a crushed and frustrated Jody finds his father alone in their barn. Jody bolts the entrance and sets the barn on fire, but he cannot go through with it and releases Will. The incident leads to a reconciliation between Jody and Will. Meanwhile, some of the men assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him. Clara persuades a defiant Ben to drive away in her car. Will later claims responsibility for accidentally starting the fire by dropping his cigar. | The smell of fire brings back bad memories for Ben, who confesses to Clara that his father was a real barn-burner. He tells her how, at the age of ten, he had to warn a farmer that his father was about to set another fire. Ben's father got away, but Ben never saw him again. Grateful that she saved his life, he tells her he is leaving town. However, Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him, so he stays. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so good, he may have to live forever.","m_cast":"Paul Newman as Ben Quick. Newman met director Martin Ritt as a student at the Actors Studio, where Ritt was a teacher-assistant for Elia Kazan.[3] Newman, who was under a contract with Warner Brothers, was loaned to 20th Century Fox for a fee of US$75,000. Meanwhile, his contract earned him US$17,500 for each ten-week shot.[4] He travelled to Clinton, Louisiana, before the start of filming to study the mannerisms, accent and speech of the Southern men in order to create a proper characterization.[5] | Orson Welles as Will Varner. The character was inspired by Big Daddy Pollitt from Tennessee Williams' play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[2] Welles' presence on the film was marked by multiple conflicts with director Martin Ritt. He agreed to take the role due to a tax debt of US$150,000; he stated years later, \"I hated making Long Hot Summer. I've seldom been as unhappy in a picture\".[6] | Director Martin Ritt met the three cast members listed below while they were students at the Actors Studio.[7][8] | Joanne Woodward as Clara Varner | Anthony Franciosa as Jody Varner | Lee Remick as Eula Varner. Remick later admitted that during the shooting she was intimidated by Orson Welles on the set because of his \"icon\" status.[9] | The supporting roles were played by: | Angela Lansbury as Minnie Littlejohn | Richard Anderson as Alan Stewart | Sarah Marshall as Agnes Stewart | Mabel Albertson as Elizabeth Stewart | J. Pat O'Malley as Ratliff | William \"Bill\" Walker as Lucius","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Producer Jerry Wald hired former co-worker and Warner Brothers director Martin Ritt to shoot the adaptation of two William Faulkner novels based on a recommendation by script writer Irving Ravetch.[10] Wald convinced the studio executives to pay US$50,000 for the rights for the novels The Sound and the Fury and The Hamlet. The first to be produced, The Hamlet, was renamed The Long Hot Summer to avoid confusion with William Shakespeare's play Hamlet.[11] Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. wrote the script, also adding fragments from Faulkner's short stories \"Barn Burning\" and \"Spotted Horses\".[12] In the new script, the book's main character, Flem Snopes, and the rest of the Snopes family were removed. The plot was recentered on a minor character, Ben Quick, and the reconciliation of the Varner family.[13][14] On their first important screenplay, Ravetch and Frank implemented their signature style, using the names of characters and a few details of the plot but significantly modifying the details of the story.[15] The final product was heavily influenced by Tennessee Williams' play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,[16] resulting in an \"erotically charged\" story.[17][18] | The film was shot in Clinton and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in CinemaScope color,[11] with a budget of US$1,645,000.[19] A Southern Gothic story,[18] Ritt decided to shoot it on location to capture the characteristics of the area, emphasizing the regional details.[12] Ritt met leading actor Paul Newman while teaching at the Actors Studio. The rest of the main cast also consisted of former Actors Studio alumni, including Joanne Woodward, Anthony Franciosa and Lee Remick.[11] | The film attracted attention for the appearance of Orson Welles as Will Varner, the patriarch of the family. 20th Century Fox wanted to avoid the casting of Welles due to his temperament, but the studio was persuaded by Ritt, who considered him the right actor for the role.[11][20] The director and the actor had several marked differences during the shooting of the movie, which included problems with the interpretation of the lines, costume design and the position of Welles while shooting the scenes.[21] At one point during the production, Welles informed Ritt that he did not want to memorize his lines, requesting instead that they be dubbed afterwards.[22] Part of the cast was intimidated by Welles' temperamental attitude.[23] | The conflicts between Welles and Ritt attracted media attention. Immediately after filming was completed, during an interview with Life, Welles explained that the cause of his behavior was that he did not know what kind of \"monkeyshines\" his co-stars would be or the \"caprices\" they would receive from him. He also stated that they overcame the differences and completed the film.[24] Welles later wrote a letter to Ritt praising his work and apologizing for his interference during the making of the movie. Ritt replied, expounding his admiration for Welles.[25] Despite the mutual apologies, during an interview in 1965, Ritt recalled an incident on the set. While the film was being shot, it was often stopped by bad weather. During a day suitable for shooting, he found Welles not ready for the scene, instead reading a newspaper in Spanish. Ritt decided to skip Welles' scene and shoot the next one. He attributed Welles' later cooperation to the incident, which Welles had found humiliating. Ritt thus earned the nickname \"the Orson Tamer\" throughout the Hollywood community.[23]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Martin Ritt","m_produced_by":"Jerry Wald","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Paul Newman Joanne Woodward Anthony Franciosa Orson Welles","m_music_by":"Alex North","m_cinematography":"Joseph LaShelle","m_edited_by":"Louis R.

The screenplay was written by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr., based in part on three works by William Faulkner: the 1931 novella \"Spotted Horses\", the 1939 short story \"Barn Burning\", and the 1940 novel The Hamlet. The title is taken from The Hamlet, as Book Three is called \"The Long Summer\". Some characters, as well as tone, were inspired by Tennessee Williams' 1955 play, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,[2] a film adaptation of which - also starring Paul Newman - was released five months after the release of The Long, Hot Summer. | The plot follows the conflicts of the Varner family after ambitious drifter Ben Quick (Newman) arrives in their small Mississippi town. Will Varner (Orson Welles), the family's patriarch and the owner of most of the town, has doubts about the abilities of his only son, Jody (Anthony Franciosa), and sees Ben as a better choice to inherit his position. Will therefore tries to push Ben and his daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) into marriage. Clara is initially reluctant to court Ben, and Jody senses that Ben threatens his position. | Filmed in Clinton, Louisiana, the film's cast was composed mostly of former Actors Studio students, whom Ritt met while he was an assistant teacher to Elia Kazan.

The music score was composed by Alex North, and the title song, \"The Long Hot Summer\", was performed by Jimmie Rodgers. | The film was well received by critics but did not score significant results at the box office. Its critical success revitalized the career of Martin Ritt, who had been blacklisted during most of the 1950s, and also earned national fame for Paul Newman, who won the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Long, Hot Summer at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/The_Long%2C_Hot_Summer.jpg/220px-The_Long%2C_Hot_Summer.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"William Faulkner Irving Ravetch Harriet Frank, Jr."}
