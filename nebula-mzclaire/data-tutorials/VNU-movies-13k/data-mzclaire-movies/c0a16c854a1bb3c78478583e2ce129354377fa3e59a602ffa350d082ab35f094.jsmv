{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In a fictionalized version of Tinseltown itself, Nick Chapman is an up-and-coming film director hot off the winning of a student award for his short film. The award captures the attention of movie executive Allen Habel (J. T. Walsh), who offers Nick a deal to make his dream picture: a character-driven, black-and-white drama taking place in a cabin during the winter. | Nick's also got a good girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) by his side and a best friend (Michael McKean) who is a struggling cinematographer. But when Nick experiences seduction to the Hollywood lifestyle, he changes on his friends and family. It doesn't help that he's got a smarmy agent (Martin Short), a starlet (Teri Hatcher) playing with his mind and the grim reminder that his less-talented and more self-satisfied classmates are working successfully in Hollywood. | After betraying his friend and girlfriend and compromising his principles, Nick ends up abandoned and desperate after Habel is replaced in a studio upheaval. A struggling Nick endeavors to restore the relationships in his life, and a kooky but loyal friend (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a classmate of Nick's, ultimately proves to be a savior to his career.","m_cast":"Kevin Bacon as Nick Chapman | Emily Longstreth as Susan Rawlings | J.
