{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Three young women meet when they embark on their careers. Neely O'Hara (Duke) is a plucky kid with undeniable talent who sings in a Broadway show—the legendary actress Helen Lawson (Hayward) is the arrogant star of the play—while Jennifer North (Tate), a beautiful blonde with limited talent, is in the chorus. Anne Welles (Parkins) is a New England ingenue who recently arrived in New York City and works as a secretary for a theatrical agency that represents Lawson. Neely, Jennifer, and Anne become fast friends, sharing the bonds of ambition and the tendency to fall in love with the wrong men. | Neely is fired from the show because Lawson considers her a threat to her top billing in the play. Assisted by Lyon Burke, an attorney from Anne's theatrical agency, Neely makes an appearance on a telethon and is given a nightclub act. She becomes an overnight success and moves to Hollywood to pursue a lucrative film career. Once she's a star, however, Neely not only duplicates the egotistical behavior of Lawson, she also falls victim to the eponymous \"dolls\" (prescription drugs, particularly the barbiturates Seconal and Nembutal and various stimulants). She betrays her husband, Mel Anderson (Milner); her career is shattered by her erratic behavior triggered by her drug abuse, and she is committed to a sanitarium for rehabilitation. | Jennifer followed Neely's path to Hollywood, where she marries nightclub singer Tony Polar (Tony Scotti) and becomes pregnant. When she learns that he has the hereditary condition Huntington's chorea - a fact his domineering half-sister and manager Miriam (Lee Grant) had been concealing - Jennifer has an abortion. As Tony's mental and physical health declines, Jennifer and Miriam check him into the same sanitarium along with Neely. Faced with Tony's mounting medical expenses, Jennifer finds herself working in French \"art films\" (soft-core pornography) to pay the bills. | Anne's natural beauty lands her a lucrative job promoting a line of cosmetics in TV commercials and print ads. She also falls under the allure of drugs to escape her doomed relationship with cad Lyon (Burke), who has an affair with her erstwhile friend, Neely. | Neely, committed to the same institution as Tony to recover from her addictions, meets him there and they sing a duet at one of the sanitarium's weekly parties. Neely is released and given a chance to rebuild her career, but the lure of drugs and alcohol proves too strong and she spirals into a hellish decline. | Meanwhile, Jennifer is diagnosed with breast cancer and needs a mastectomy. She phones her mother, seeking moral support; but her mother is only concerned with the reaction from her friends at Jennifer's \"art films\". Jennifer then succumbs to depression and commits suicide by drug overdose. | Anne abandons drugs and her unfaithful lover and returns to New England. Lyon ends his affair with Neely and travels to New England to ask Anne to marry him. She decides to move on with her life and declines his offer.","m_cast":"Barbara Parkins as Anne Welles | Patty Duke as Neely O'Hara | Sharon Tate as Jennifer North | Paul Burke as Lyon Burke | Tony Scotti as Tony Polar | Susan Hayward as Helen Lawson | Martin Milner as Mel Anderson | Charles Drake as Kevin Gillmore | Alexander Davion as Ted Casablanca | Richard Angarola as Claude Chardot | Lee Grant as Miriam Polar | Naomi Stevens as Miss Steinberg | Robert H.

In the film, Anne and Lyon never marry and do not have a child together. Rather, she leaves Lyon and returns to Lawrenceville, which is described as the one place she found real happiness. Lyon later visits her to propose but she refuses. These last-minute changes in the script, so out of keeping with Anne's established character (well known to millions of readers), prompted original screenwriter Harlan Ellison, who wanted to keep the original downbeat ending, to remove his name and credit from the film. | Another important difference is that the film is clearly set in the mid-to-late 1960s, whereas in the book the story started in 1945 and developed throughout two decades, much unlike in the film, where the events unfolded over the course of a few years. | Judy Garland was originally cast as Helen Lawson, but was fired when she (reputedly) came to work drunk;[7] Susan Hayward replaced her in the role after production had already begun. On July 20, 2009, Patty Duke appeared at the Castro Theater in San Francisco with a benefit screening of the film, and said that director Mark Robson made Garland wait from 8am to 4pm before filming her scenes for the day, knowing that Garland would be upset and drunk by that time. Hayward reportedly had a difficult relationship with the cast and crew, and her clashes with Duke becoming part of the dramatic tension between their characters. | 20th Century Fox wanted contract star Raquel Welch to play Jennifer but she refused, not wanting to play a \"sexpot\" role. She asked to play Neely but the studio refused.[8] | Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, a 1970 satirical pastiche, was filmed by Twentieth Century-Fox while the studio was being sued by Jacqueline Susann, according to Irving Mansfield's book Jackie and Me. Susann created the title for a Jean Holloway-scripted sequel that was rejected by the studio, which allowed Russ Meyer to film a radically different movie with the same title. The suit went to court after Susann's death in 1974; the estate won damages of $2 million against Fox. | Richard Dreyfuss appears briefly as a stagehand.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Valley of the Dolls  by Jacqueline Susann","m_directed_by":"Mark Robson","m_produced_by":"David Weisbart","m_screenplay_by":"Helen Deutsch Dorothy Kingsley Harlan Ellison (uncredited)","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Barbara Parkins Patty Duke Sharon Tate Susan Hayward Lee Grant","m_music_by":"André Previn & Dory Previn (songs) John Williams","m_cinematography":"William H.
