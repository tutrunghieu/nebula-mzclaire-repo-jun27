The film is based on the 1947 novel The Purple Plain by H. E. Bates,[2] one of three novels he wrote after his travels to Burma and India in 1945, on military assignment to write short pieces portraying the Burmese war for American readers. The novel was first serialised in the Saturday Evening Post in September and October 1947.[3] The film script was written by novelist Eric Ambler in consultation with Bates. | The film was produced with a relatively modest budget by Two Cities Films and was directed by the American director Robert Parrish with colour photography by Geoffrey Unsworth. The film was shot in Sigiriya, in what was then Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and utilised several locations later used in Bridge on the River Kwai. The aircraft in the film were repainted in accurate camouflage and markings, and were provided through the co-operation of the Royal Air Force, which also provided several staff on-site during the filming. Some of these are credited as extras. | Anna is played by Win Min Than who was born Helga Johnston,[4] the wife of Burmese politician and businessman Bo Setkya (1916–1969; aka Thakin Aung Than, Bo Set Kya or Set-kya), in her only film role.[5][6] Her father was Australian and her mother Burmese. In 1964 she shaved her head and became a Buddhist nun in Rangoon, adopting the name Daw Wanthalamar. Her husband had fled the country, went underground, and had not been heard of since General Ne Win had taken over the country in March 1962.[7][8] She left the convent a year later and went into business selling gourds.[4] Both Bo Set Kya and Ne Win were members of the Thirty Comrades.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Purple Plain  by H.
