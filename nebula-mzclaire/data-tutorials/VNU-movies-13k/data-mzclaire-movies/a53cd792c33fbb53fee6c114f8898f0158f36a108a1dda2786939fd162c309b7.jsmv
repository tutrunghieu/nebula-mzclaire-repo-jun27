{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the early 1950s, world-renowned film maker John Wilson (Eastwood), travels to Africa for his next film bringing with him a young writer chum named Pete Verrill (Jeff Fahey). While there, he becomes obsessed with hunting elephants while neglecting the preparations for the film. This leads to a conflict between the men on several levels, most notably over the idea of killing for sport such a grand animal. Even Wilson concedes that it is so wrong that it is not just a crime against nature, but a \"sin.\" Yet he cannot overcome his desire to bring down a giant bull, a \"tusker\" with massive ivory tusks. Wilson's final realization that his is a petty, ignoble pursuit comes at a late point and with a tragic price, as the local expert guide Kivu (Boy Mathias Chuma) is killed protecting him from an elephant Wilson decides not to shoot.","m_cast":"Clint Eastwood as John Wilson | Jeff Fahey as Pete Verrill | Alun Armstrong as Ralph Lockhart | George Dzundza as Paul Landers | Charlotte Cornwell as Miss Wilding, Wilson's Secretary | Norman Lumsden as Butler George | Marisa Berenson as Kay Gibson | Richard Vanstone as Phil Duncan | Edward Tudor-Pole as Reissar, British Partner | Roddy Maude-Roxby as Thompson, British Partner | Richard Warwick as Basil Fields, British Partner | Boy Mathias Chuma as Kivu | Timothy Spall as Hodkins, Bush Pilot","m_reception":null,"m_production":"At times, Eastwood, as the John Huston-like character of John Wilson, can be heard drawing out his vowels, speaking in Huston's distinctive style. | The film was shot on location in Kariba, Zimbabwe and surrounds including at Lake Kariba, Victoria Falls and Hwange,[2] over two months in the summer of 1989.[3] Some interiors were shot in and around Pinewood Studios in England. The boat used in the film was constructed in England of glass fibre and shipped to Africa for filming.[2] It was electrically powered, but was fitted with motors and engines by special effects expert John Evans to make the boat appear to be steam-powered.[2] The elephant gun used in the film was a £65,000 double barrelled elephant magnum made by Holland & Holland, the gunmakers who had made the gun used by Huston when he was in Africa for The African Queen in 1951. The White Hunter Black Heart filmmakers took great care with the gun and sold it back to Holland & Holland after filming \"unharmed, unscratched, unused.\"[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Novel: Peter Viertel","m_directed_by":"Clint Eastwood","m_produced_by":"Clint Eastwood","m_screenplay_by":"Peter Viertel James Bridges Burt Kennedy","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Clint Eastwood | Jeff Fahey | George Dzundza | Alun Armstrong | Marisa Berenson","m_music_by":"Lennie Niehaus","m_cinematography":"Jack N.
