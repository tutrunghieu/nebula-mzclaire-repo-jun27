{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During the early 1970s, FBI agent Ray Levoi is assigned to aid in the investigation of a political murder, that of tribal council member Leo Fast Elk (Allan R.J. Joseph), on a Native American reservation in South Dakota. Agent William Dawes, Ray's superior, has chosen him for the task due to his mixed Sioux heritage, which might assist in the inquiry as they interview local townspeople. Ray is partnered with agent Frank \"Cooch\" Coutelle, who has diligently worked on the probe looking to apprehend a prime suspect: Aboriginal Rights Movement radical Jimmy Looks Twice. While helping Cooch track down the suspect, Ray gradually becomes sensitized to Indian issues, partially from his attraction to Maggie Eagle Bear, a political Native American activist and schoolteacher.[3] | Mocked and ridiculed by the locals (being called a \"Washington Redskin\"), including tribal police officer Walter Crow Horse, Ray finds that he has an unaccountable standing with some of the tribal elders such as Grandpa Sam Reaches. The natives recognize Ray as \"Thunderheart\", a Native American hero slain at the Wounded Knee Massacre in the past, and now reincarnated to deliver them from their current troubles.[3] | Much to Cooch's anger, Ray comes to suspect there is a conspiracy and cover-up involving the small town. He and Crow Horse later discover that a local government-sponsored plan to strip mine uranium on the reservation is at the root of the killings. The mining is polluting the water supply and fueling a bloody conflict between the reservation's anti-government ruling council and the pro-government natives who, led by tribal council president Jack Milton, are not above using violence to further their aims. Milton does not own the land where the mining occurs, but gets kickbacks from the leases. Cooch is later revealed to be part of the scandal to silence the opposition and help broker the land deal. Soon after finding Maggie Eagle Bear and former convict Richard Yellow Hawk murdered, a showdown ensues between Cooch and pro-government collaborators against Ray, Crow Horse and the anti-government activists. Cooch becomes outnumbered by the armed resistance and is later investigated on charges of corruption.[3]","m_cast":"Val Kilmer as Ray Levoi | Sam Shepard as Frank \"Cooch\" Coutelle | Graham Greene as Walter Crow Horse | Fred Ward as Jack Milton | Fred Thompson as William Dawes | Sheila Tousey as Maggie Eagle Bear | Ted Thin Elk as Grandpa Sam Reaches | John Trudell as Jimmy Looks Twice | Julius Drum as Richard Yellow Hawk | Sarah Brave as Maisy Blue Legs (Grandma) | Allan R.J.

Apted makes documentaries as well as fiction films, and in such features as Coal Miner's Daughter and Gorillas in the Mist and such documentaries as 35 Up he pays great attention to the people themselves - not just what they do, and how that pushes things along.\"[12] | Janet Maslin of The New York Times said the film had \"the shape of a thriller\" and a \"documentary's attentiveness to detail.\" She also said that the \"film's outstanding performance comes from Graham Greene, an Oscar nominee for Dances With Wolves, a film that looks like an utter confection beside this plainer, harder-hitting drama.... Mr. Greene proves himself a naturally magnetic actor who deserves to be seen in other, more varied roles.\"[2] Critic Kathleen Maher for The Austin Chronicle viewed Thunderheart as an \"element of misty romanticism about Native Americans that Apted just doesn't manage to pull off. His yarn, however, is a good one even if it could be told a little better.\" However, she added that \"Apted manages to say a lot by cutting between the squalor of life on the reservation to the magnificence of the land around it. Unfortunately, when the characters speak for themselves, they are often forced to deliver lines that are unspeakable.\"[13] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C rating calling it \"hokey\" and \"laborious\". He viewed the film as a \"leftover 1970s conspiracy thriller were it not for the novelty of its setting: a modern Indian reservaton — which, as the movie reveals, is by now a fancy word for slum.\" He did however compliment actor Greene, calling his performance — the film's \"one redeeming feature\".[14] Author C.M. of Time Out said that \"Apted and cinematographer Roger Deakins focus unblinkingly on the poverty endemic to the reservation. This directness, however, contrasts with an over-complicated script by John Fusco.\" But he acknowledged that \"the story boasts integrity and serves as a forceful indictment of on-going injustice.\"[15] | Sean Axmaker of Turner Classic Movies boasted on the film's merits by declaring, \"Thunderheart dispenses with clichés of Indian culture while respectfully showing the traditions kept alive on the reservation and exposing conditions on the reservation, all within the conventions of an entertaining and involving Hollywood murder mystery with a message.\"[5] Rating 3 Stars, Leonard Maltin wrote that the film was an \"engrossing thriller\" that is \"notable for its keen attention to detail regarding Sioux customs and spirituality, and its enlightened point of view.\"[16] | The film premiered in cinemas on April 3, 1992 in wide release throughout the U.S..
