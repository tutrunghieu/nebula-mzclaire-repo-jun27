{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Mitchell Vineyard, in the rolling hills of Northern California, is the very blood of Clovis Mitchell (James Stewart), a spare and dignified grandfather and guardian to Kelly (Stephanie Zimbalist) and her brother Chris (Michael Sharrett). But the heart of the household is Lassie, a handsome young collie, affectionate, obedient, sensitive and very wise. There's a threat in the air one night when Jamison (Pernell Roberts) and his associate Finch (Robert Lussier) appear at the winery and offer to buy the land from Clovis. They get a flat refusal from the old man while Lassie growls in the background. Jamison promises to return, and does, to claim Lassie, one of a litter he says escaped during a fire. She has a tattoo mark in her right ear to prove it. Clovis has no alternative but to give up the dog, and tells his heart-broken grand-children. But Lassie has an alternative: taken by private plane to Jamison's home in Colorado Springs, fitted with a handsome green collar with gold studs, Lassie makes her escape. Chased by helicopter and kennel men through the rocks and hills of Colorado, Lassie manages to elude them and out stare a cougar before she joins up with new friends – Gus (Mickey Rooney), a down-at-heel wrestling manager and Apollo (Mike Mazurki), a kindly mountain of a man and Gus's so-called star. | About the time they are binding up Lassie's sores, giving her food and water, and moving along in their van, young Chris bolts on his first day of the school term and sets off alone in search of Lassie. With his distraught grandfather setting out to find the boy, and Kelly and her sweetheart, attorney Allan Fogerty (Lane Davies), checking the police, Chris takes a car conveyer in the direction of Colorado Springs. Soon after the truck takes off, a hungry and frightened Chris leaves the vehicle, buys food in a restaurant from a sympathetic waitress (Alice Faye), then goes out to look for another truck and finally dives into the back of a cattle truck. It's the restaurant waitress, hearing reports of Chris's disappearance, who calls his home and tells his sister where the boy has been. But Chris is on the move again, and so is Lassie: he in an empty cattle truck, she in the doorway of a freight car. Lassie leaps from the freight car and continues her journey. Clovis and the police officer who is aiding in the search for Chris, hear his cries as he is about to be crushed by a herd of longhorn being loaded into his hiding place. Everybody is home – everybody but Lassie, whose ownership by Clovis has been clarified by Allan, the young attorney, who is about to join the family as an in-law. | Lassie continues her long, painful journey. Wet, sore-footed and limping, she stumbles upon the Mike Curb Congregation who are rehearsing. The group takes Lassie along to their engagement where a flare is knocked over, causing a fire. There is panic. Lassie is trying to save the life of a kitten from a burning dressing room and is presumed dead. But she isn't, and the next day – Thanksgiving – Lassie, tired and filthy, comes wagging over the hill to Chris, Clover, Kelly and home.","m_cast":"James Stewart as Clovis Mitchell | Stephanie Zimbalist as Kelly Mitchell | Pernell Roberts as Jamison | Michael Sharrett as Chris Mitchell | Mickey Rooney as Gus | Alice Faye as The Waitress (Alice) | Gene Evans as Sheriff Andrews | Mike Mazurki as Apollo | Robert Lussier as Finch | Lane Davies as Allan Fogerty | James V.

James Stewart is featured in one of only three musical film roles that he played: the first was Born to Dance (1936) in which he introduced the Cole Porter standard Easy To Love and the second was Pot O' Gold (1941). This was also his final onscreen appearance in a live-action film. The screenplay and song score are supplied by the prolific Sherman Brothers of Mary Poppins fame. Their song \"When You're Loved\" was nominated for an Academy Award for \"Best Original Song\" and was sung by Debby Boone. It is also the only musical film featuring Lassie. | Released in the wake of Star Wars, the film was panned as old-fashioned and flopped at the box office. Critics expressed dismay at Stewart singing unmemorable songs as the grandfather. Following the film's failure he semi-retired from acting. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ The Magic of Lassie: American Film Institute (AFI), retrieved April 19, 2016.","m_external_link":"The Magic of Lassie at the Internet Movie Database | The Magic of Lassie at the TCM Movie Database | The Magic of Lassie at AllMovie","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Moflassie.jpg/220px-Moflassie.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Jean Holloway Robert B.
