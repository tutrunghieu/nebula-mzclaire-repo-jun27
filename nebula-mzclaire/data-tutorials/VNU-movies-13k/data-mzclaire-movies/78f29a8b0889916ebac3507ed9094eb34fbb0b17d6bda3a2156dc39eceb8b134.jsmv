{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. | Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. | As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. | On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IR£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic lights on red on the Naas Dual Carriageway when a motorcycle with two men on it pulls up beside her. The driver breaks the window of her car and then shoots her six times. The two flee and dispose of the bike and the gun in a nearby canal. | Guerin is mourned by her family, friends, associates and the country at large. Her violent death results in the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and Gilligan together with several of his henchmen are tried and sentenced to lengthy gaol terms. In an epilogue, we learn that \"Veronica Guerin's writing turned the tide in the drug war. Her murder galvanised Ireland into action. Thousands of people took to the streets in weekly anti-drug marches, which drove the dealers out of Dublin and forced the drug barons underground. Within a week of her death, in an emergency session of the Parliament, the Government altered the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland to allow the High Court to freeze the assets of suspected drug barons.\"","m_cast":"Cate Blanchett as Veronica Guerin | Gerard McSorley as John Gilligan | Ciarán Hinds as John Traynor | Brenda Fricker as Bernie Guerin | Barry Barnes as Graham Turley | Simon O'Driscoll as Cathal Turley | Don Wycherley as Chris Mulligan | Alan Devine as Gerry Hutch | Paul Ronan as Jimmy Guerin | Danielle Fox Clarke as the Girl Junkie | Stephen O'Doherty as Young Junkie | Laurence Kinlan as Young Timmy (junky)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was shot on location in Dublin and in Naas in County Kildare, with some scenes also being shot near Newtownmountkennedy in County Wicklow. | Colin Farrell makes a cameo appearance as a heavily tattooed young man Guerin briefly engages in conversation about a soccer match.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Joel Schumacher","m_produced_by":"Jerry Bruckheimer","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Cate Blanchett Gerard McSorley Ciarán Hinds Brenda Fricker Amy Shiels","m_music_by":"Harry Gregson-Williams","m_cinematography":"Brendan Galvin","m_edited_by":"David Gamble","m_production_company":"Touchstone Pictures Jerry Bruckheimer Films","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"8 July 2003 (2003-07-08) (Ireland; limited) | 11 July 2003 (2003-07-11) (Ireland; wide) | 1 August 2003 (2003-08-01) (United Kingdom) | 8 October 2003 (2003-10-08) (United States; limited) | 17 October 2003 (2003-10-17) (United States; wide)","m_running_time":"98 minutes","m_country":"United States Ireland United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$17 million[1]","m_box_office":"$9.4 million[1] | Veronica Guerin is a 2003 Irish biographical crime film directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Cate Blanchett in the title role.
