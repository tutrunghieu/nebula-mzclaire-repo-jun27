{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1964, in Erie, Pennsylvania, aspiring jazz drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) is asked by Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) and Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn) to sit in with their band at an annual talent show, after their regular drummer breaks his arm. The band, which also includes a bass player (Ethan Embry), adopts the name \"The Oneders\" (pronounced \"wonders\", but often mispronounced \"oh-NEE-ders\"). At the talent show, Guy launches into a faster tempo than intended for Jimmy's ballad, \"That Thing You Do\", and the band wins the competition. The Oneders' performance at the talent show earns them a paying gig at a local restaurant, where they begin to sell recordings of \"That Thing You Do\" and are noticed by talent promoter Phil Horace (Chris Ellis), whom they hire as their manager. | Horace achieves radio airplay for the song and books the band at a rock & roll showcase concert in Pittsburgh, after which they are offered a contract by Play-Tone Records A&R representative Mr. White (Hanks). White changes the band's name to \"The Wonders\" as they join a Midwestern Play-Tone tour, taking along Jimmy's girlfriend, Faye (Liv Tyler) as their official \"costume mistress\". During the tour, \"That Thing You Do\" garners national radio airplay and becomes a bona-fide hit. As the band's popularity soars, Jimmy grows frustrated that the group is not focused on creating more music, while the remainder of the band enjoys their time in the spotlight. All the while, Guy and Faye grow closer as friends. When the song enters the top ten on the Billboard charts, the band is taken off the tour and sent to Los Angeles. | Faye falls ill on the trip and is nursed by Guy. Jimmy is seemingly disinterested in her well-being, being preoccupied with trying to convince White to let the band record more of his original songs. After a publicity tour, the band is set to appear on The Hollywood Television Showcase, a nationally-televised live variety show. They begin to show signs of discord. Jimmy continues to vent frustration at White over the band's direction. The bass player (who was leaving to join the United States Marine Corps in a few weeks) goes to Disneyland with a group of Marines and never returns; he is replaced in the broadcast by a session bassist. During the performance, as the band is being visually introduced to the viewing audience, the caption \"Careful girls, he's engaged!\" appears under Jimmy's name. Jimmy becomes upset with Faye in the dressing room afterward, and says that he has no intention of marrying her. Heartbroken and weary with his arrogant personality and lack of devotion, Faye terminates their relationship. | The next day at a scheduled recording session, Lenny is missing, and Jimmy's grievances with White reach a boiling point and he quits the band. Guy is sorry to see the end of the band. White confronts him, and declares the band a one-hit wonder. After an impromptu jam session with his idol, jazz pianist Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), Guy returns to the band's hotel, where he meets Faye and shares a long kiss with her. In an epilogue, it is revealed that Jimmy forms another band (The Heardsmen) and has a successful career as an artist and producer, Lenny becomes a casino manager, and the bass player earns a Purple Heart for injuries suffered at Khe Sanh. Guy and Faye start a family in Washington, where Guy teaches jazz composition at a music conservatory.","m_cast":"Tom Everett Scott as Guy Patterson | Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy Mattingly | Tom Hanks as Mr. White | Steve Zahn as Lenny Haise | Ethan Embry as T.

The movie debuted at No. 3.[10] It was moderately successful at the box office, grossing $25,857,416 domestically and $8,728,000 abroad for a worldwide gross of $34,585,416.[1]","m_production":"The movie features original music by Tom Hanks, Adam Schlesinger, Rick Elias, Scott Rogness, Mike Piccirillo, Gary Goetzman and Howard Shore. In the movie, The Wonders rise to brief stardom on the strength of \"That Thing You Do\", a song written as a wistful ballad but which becomes an uptempo rocker during the band's first performance at a talent show. Written and composed for the film by Adam Schlesinger, bassist for Fountains of Wayne and Ivy and released on the film's soundtrack, the song became a genuine hit for The Wonders in 1996 (the song peaked at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100, #22 on the Adult Contemporary charts, #18 on the Adult Top 40, and #24 on the Top 40 Mainstream charts). The track was nominated for a 1996 Golden Globe Award as well as a 1996 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Mike Viola of The Candy Butchers provided the lead vocals for the Wonders. | In the film, the title song is referenced with \"All My Only Dreams\" as the B-side. The actual 45 RPM single, released to record stores in North America, features \"Dance With Me Tonight\" as its B-side. The song has since been recorded by The Knack and Bubblegum Lemonade. The Wonders are also seen playing the song, \"Little Wild One.\" This was written by the band Gigolo Aunts as a \"faux-Beatles\"-style tune at the request of their record label to be submitted for consideration for inclusion in the film.[2] | The song that plays during the film's opening credits, \"Lovin' You Lots and Lots,\" is credited to the fictitious Norm Wooster Singers and was actually written by Hanks. This song is a parody of Ray Conniff, Mitch Miller, and other practitioners of the \"beautiful music\" or proto-Muzak formats that were a staple of adult radio during the early '60s such as on KPOL (AM)1540 in Los Angeles.[3][4] Hanks also composed Guy's jazzy signature drum solo, \"I Am Spartacus.\" | The ballad \"My World Is Over\" by Diane Dane seems inspired by the compositions of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and the vocal performance is strongly reminiscent of Jackie DeShannon. | The tour and TV appearance are done in the authentic style of rock bands of the mid-1960s, including Go-Go girls, elaborate sharing of microphones, and formal clothing in various matching colors. | The character of fictional Pittsburgh disc jockey \"Boss Vic Koss\" whose actual last name was \"Kosslovich\" may be inspired by real-life Pittsburgh radio personality \"Mad Mike Metro,\" who worked at WZUM in the 60s. His actual last name was \"Metrovich.\" | The song \"Voyage Around the Moon\" by the fictional band Saturn 5 closely resembles \"Pipeline\" by The Chantays. The scene where The Wonders are miming the instrumental tune \"Shrimp Shack\" during the filming of a beach party film titled Weekend at Party Pier is an overt reference to the scene in Pajama Party wherein The Nooney Rickett 4 play the instrumental song Beach Ball.[5] | There were at least two real bands named the Wonders who made the record charts at various radio stations in the early 60s. One had a ballad titled \"With These Hands\" (b/w \"Please Don't Cry\"; Bamboo 523) that was played by KCRG in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the fall of 1962.[6] | The other Wonders had a regional hit record called \"Say There\" (b/w \"Marilyn\"; Colpix 699), released by Colpix Records in August 1963.[7] Little is known about these Wonders, except that they were probably from Ohio or Pennsylvania; \"Say There\" hit the Top 20 at WCOL in Columbus, Ohio, and made the Top 30 at KQV in Pittsburgh.[8] (There is a scene in the film in which a disc jockey at WCOL is seen playing \"That Thing You Do!\")[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tom Hanks","m_produced_by":"Jonathan Demme Gary Goetzman Edward Saxon","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tom Everett Scott Liv Tyler Johnathon Schaech Steve Zahn Ethan Embry Tom Hanks","m_music_by":"Howard Shore","m_cinematography":"Tak Fujimoto","m_edited_by":"Richard Chew","m_production_company":"Clavius Base","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"October 4, 1996 (1996-10-04) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"108 minutes 149 minutes (Extended cut)","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$26 million","m_box_office":"$34,585,416[1] | That Thing You Do! is a 1996 American musical comedy drama film written by, directed by, and co-starring Tom Hanks.
