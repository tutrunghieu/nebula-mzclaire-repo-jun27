{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is told through the naive eyes of a diplomat's young son, Philippe, who idolizes his father's butler, Baines. Baines has invented a heroic persona to keep the boy entertained, and often tells him stories of his exotic and daring adventures in Africa and elsewhere, stories such as putting down a native uprising single-handed, killing a man in self-defense, shooting lions and so on. | In reality, the butler has never been to Africa and is stuck in a loveless marriage, while dreaming of happiness with a younger woman (who he tells Philippe is his niece after the boy finds them together). After Baines has an argument with his betrayed wife, she accidentally falls from a landing to her death. However, Philippe believes that he has seen Baines murder her. The boy desperately and clumsily attempts to protect his hero when the police investigate, but his efforts only lead Baines deeper into trouble.","m_cast":"Ralph Richardson as Baines | Michèle Morgan as Julie | Sonia Dresdel as Mrs. Baines | Bobby Henrey as Philippe | Denis O'Dea as Chief Inspector Crowe | Jack Hawkins as Detective Ames | Walter Fitzgerald as Dr. Fenton | Dandy Nichols as Mrs. Patterson | Joan Young as Mrs. Barrow | Karel Stepanek as First Secretary | Gerard Heinz as Ambassador | Torin Thatcher as Police Constable | James Hayter as Perry | Geoffrey Keen as Detective Davis | Bernard Lee as Inspector Hart, Special Branch | John Ruddock as Dr. Wilson | Hay Petrie as Clock Winder | Dora Bryan as Rose | George Woodbridge as Sergeant, Chelsea Police Station","m_reception":"The film was one of the most popular movies at the British box office in 1948.[2] | The Fallen Idol was included at number 48 on Time Out magazine's list of the \"100 best British films\", which polled critics and members of the film industry.
