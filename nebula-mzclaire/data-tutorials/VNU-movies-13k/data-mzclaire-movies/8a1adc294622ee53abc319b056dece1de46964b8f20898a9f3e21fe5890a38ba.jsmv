{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Lady in the Van tells the true story of Alan Bennett's strained friendship with Miss Mary Shepherd, an eccentric homeless woman whom Bennett befriended in the 1970s before allowing her temporarily to park her Bedford van in the driveway of his Camden home. She stayed there for 15 years. As the story develops Bennett learns that Miss Shepherd is really Margaret Fairchild, a former gifted pupil of the pianist Alfred Cortot. She had played Chopin in a promenade concert, tried to become a nun, was committed to an institution by her brother, escaped, had an accident when her van was hit by a motorcyclist for which she believed herself to blame, and thereafter lived in fear of arrest.","m_cast":"Maggie Smith as Miss Mary Shepherd / Margaret Fairchild | Alex Jennings as Alan Bennett | Roger Allam as Rufus | Deborah Findlay as Pauline | Jim Broadbent as Underwood | Cecilia Noble as Miss Briscoe | Gwen Taylor as Mam | Frances de la Tour as Ursula Vaughan Williams | Nicholas Burns as Giles Perry | Pandora Colin as Mrs Perry | The principal cast of the film of Bennett's The History Boys, appear in cameo roles, with the exception of de la Tour, who has a more prominent role in this film; and Richard Griffiths, who died in 2013. This includes: Samuel Barnett (as Donald),[9] Samuel Anderson (as a Jehovah's Witness),[6] Stephen Campbell Moore (as a doctor),[10] Dominic Cooper (as a theatre actor),[6] James Corden (as a street trader),[11] Sacha Dhawan (as Doctor Malik),[12] Andrew Knott (as an ambulance driver),[13] Clive Merrison (as a man attending confession),[10] Jamie Parker (as an estate agent),[11] and Russell Tovey (as a man with an earring).[6]","m_reception":"As of 20 March 2016[update], The Lady in the Van has grossed $35.8 million worldwide; $8.8 million in North America and $18.9 million in the United Kingdom.[4] | The Lady in the Van received positive reviews, with particular praise being aimed at Smith's acting. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 92%, based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's consensus states, \"Led by a marvelous performance from Maggie Smith, Lady in the Van wrings poignant, often hilarious insight from its fact-based source material.\"[35] On Metacritic the film holds a score of 70 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[36] | \"Maggie Smith delivers a compelling performance in The Lady in the Van, as Alan Bennett’s play comes to the big screen 15 years after it premiered at the National Theatre.\" | Guy Lodge, of Variety magazine, attended the worldwide premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. After the screening, he described Smith's portrayal of Mary Shepherd as \"one of the most tailor-made leading roles of her late career\". Even though, he says, the film is \"low on narrative drive\" and \"marred by a misjudged final act\", \"Hytner's amiable [love] fest\" is \"enlivened by Smith’s signature irascibility; silver-dollar auds should turn up, if not in droves, at least in healthy vanloads.\".[9] Frank Scheck, of The Hollywood Reporter, also attended the premiere, and like Lodge, he felt Smith's character was the \"driving force\" behind the film. Not to his surprise, Smith \"fully exploits the humor in her character's bizarreness\". For example, when her character \"receives guidance from the Virgin Mary; her utter obliviousness to her lack of personal hygiene; her hatred of music that sends her fleeing whenever she hears a note; and her ragtag wardrobe that's been assembled from various dumpsters\". In spite of the humour, Scheck praised Smith for \"subtly convey[ing] the emotional pain and desperation of [an] addled old woman, especially in the scenes [where she is] taken away by social services and gently treated to a thorough washing, feeding and medical examination\".[38] | \"She brilliantly re-creates her stage role [from] Alan Bennett’s autobiographical play about Miss Shepherd.\" | Ian Nathan, of Empire magazine, awarded the film four out of five stars. Like many, he applauded Smith's \"liberating\" role, describing her as \"shrill and hilarious, but not a joke\". He also commended the directing, saying: \"Unshowy to a fault, Hytner delivers a fine, moving comedy of English manners between a writer and his eccentric tenant, which slowly deepens into an exploration of human bonds\".[39] In a similar fashion, Peter Bradshaw, of The Guardian, awarded four out of five stars and called it an \"enjoyable film from Nicholas Hytner\". While he felt Smith’s performance - \"honed from previous stage and radio\" adaptations - was \"terrifically good\", he praised Jennings for giving a \"sharp and sympathetic performance as Bennett\".[40] | \"It’s all good fun, it’s just a shame about the attempts to impose drama on what is essentially a comic character study.\" | Donald Clarke, of The Irish Times, awarded the film three out of five stars. He said Smith's role is \"indecently appropriate\", while de la Tour's is \"fabulous\", and Allam's is \"equally as good\" as the latter. The \"problem\" with the film is \"that, like Miss Shepherd’s van, the story rarely\" moves on. It remains \"gracelessly the same throughout\", with \"narrative details\" being \"plucked like unattached footnotes\". When the characters do \"open up\", during a \"bafflingly appalling final scene\", you \"rather wish the doors had remained shut\".[42] Also awarding three out of five stars, Stella Papamichael, of the Radio Times, had similar feelings. She said: Smith and Jennings' characters \"veer close to a moment of pathos towards the end [of the film], but [it's not] too profound. The social awkwardness [leaves] a more lingering impression\" on the audience.[43] | Jess Hassenger, of AV Club, gave a \"rotten\" review, stating that \"by design\", The Lady in the Van is \"flawed\" because the film is \"supposed to be revealing Bennett, not Shepherd\"; a fact that many \"will be reminded of before the film’s end\". Smith's character is very \"commanding\" on screen, while Jennings \"honorably tend[s] to his character’s quiet, semi-closeted homosexuality\". No \"matter how many meaningful considerations of mortality\" are thrown his way; through the screenplay, Jennings \"doesn't have a chance\" against Smith.[44] On the contrary, Slant Magazine's Elise Nakhnikian said the film is all about the \"fastidious, somewhat timid, and reclusive playwright Alan Bennett\", and stated the film's \"annoying glibness is neatly summarized\" by the line: \"In life, going downhill is an uphill job\".[45]","m_production":"The Lady in the Van was greenlit on 3 June 2014, TriStar Productions and BBC Films working together to make the film adaptation of Alan Bennett's West End hit. TriStar won the film rights to handle worldwide distribution, while the BBC will be the first to show the film on television in the UK. The involvement of Maggie Smith and Nicholas Hytner was announced simultaneously with the film,[14] but they were attached to the project as early as 9 May (coincidentally Bennett's 80th birthday).[15][16] Both of them had collaborated with Bennett in the past; Hytner on The Madness of King George in 1994, and the film adaptation of The History Boys (in 2006), while Smith had portrayed Miss Shepherd in the original theatre production in 1999,[17] and again in a 2009 radio adaptation by BBC Radio 4.[7] | Principal photography began at 23 Gloucester Crescent (51.538681, -0.145635)[18][19] in North London in October 2014.[20] The film was shot in and around Bennett's old house in Camden Town, where the real Miss Shepherd spent 15 years on his driveway. According to Hytner, they \"never considered [filming] anywhere else\", and it was \"entertaining to see the look on all the residents’ faces\"; many of whom \"were there when the van drove down the crescent\". Filming was a difficult experience for Smith because she spent \"most of her time confined to one van or another\". The van \"wasn't the most comfortable\" of places, and the film was \"much more concentrated\" than the play; the stage version \"was more physically demanding\", but Smith admitted it was a \"long time ago\" and she \"could handle it\" back then. She joked that \"not a lot of method [acting] was required when you were dressed as [she] was, and in a van\".[21] | The production crew filmed for two days in November 2014 in Broadstairs in Thanet, Kent, notably Viking Bay, featuring Morelli's Gelato and the Palace Cinema. Producer Kevin Loader described Viking Bay as \"the perfect location\" and said the area had benefited by £40,000, as the 50-strong crew stayed locally and took advantage of the various restaurants and bars.[22] Buckmaster House in Broadstairs, the only filming location outside London, was featured as Bennett's mother's nursing home in Weston-super-Mare.[23]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Lady in the Van  by Alan Bennett","m_directed_by":"Nicholas Hytner","m_produced_by":"Nicholas Hytner | Damian Jones | Kevin Loader","m_screenplay_by":"Alan Bennett","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Maggie Smith | Alex Jennings | Jim Broadbent | Frances de la Tour | Roger Allam","m_music_by":"George Fenton","m_cinematography":"Andrew Dunn","m_edited_by":"Tariq Anwar","m_production_company":"BBC Films","m_distributed_by":"TriStar Pictures","m_release_dates":"12 September 2015 (2015-09-12) (Toronto International Film Festival) | 13 November 2015 (2015-11-13) (United Kingdom) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom United States [2]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$6 million[3]","m_box_office":"$41.4 million[4] | The Lady in the Van is a 2015 American-British [5] comedy-drama film directed by Nicholas Hytner, written by Alan Bennett, and starring Maggie Smith and Alex Jennings. It tells the true story of Mary Shepherd, an elderly woman who lived in a dilapidated van on Bennett's driveway in London for 15 years.[6] Smith previously portrayed Shepherd twice: in the original 1999 theatrical production, which earned her a Best Actress nomination at the 2000 Olivier Awards;[7] and in the 2009 BBC Radio 4 adaptation. | Hytner directed the original stage production at the Queen's Theatre in London, while Bennett adapted the screenplay from his 1999 West End play of the same name, which was nominated at the 2000 Olivier Awards for Play of the Year. The film was shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival[8] and received largely positive reviews from critics. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE LADY IN THE VAN (12A)\".
