Both government and Communist agents immediately develop an interest in the amulet's possible military use. (This is a metaphor for the age of nuclear weapons, as the novel was written two years after atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). | In the meantime, Jones and rival professor Kellgore are both in line for a promotion to take over from retiring Dean Updike as head of this California university's language department. A new colleague and possible romantic interest, Professor Fenster, is startled by Jones' behavior, particularly at a party thrown by Updike's wife that turns into chaos.","m_cast":"Tom Poston as Professor Jonathan Jones | Julia Meade as Professor Virginia Fenster | Jim Backus as Professor Kellgore | Cecil Kellaway as Dean Updike | Margaret Dumont as Persephone Updike | Fred Clark as General Bullivar","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"William Castle","m_produced_by":"William Castle","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tom Poston Julia Meade Jim Backus Fred Clark Cecil Kellaway","m_music_by":"Bernard Green","m_cinematography":"Gordon Avil","m_edited_by":"Edwin H.
