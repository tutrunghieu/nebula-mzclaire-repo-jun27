{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":"Uncredited roles |  | Cast notes: | In his role as adviser to the film, George M. Cohan, who admired Fred Astaire's work, let it be known that he preferred Astaire, who also bore a passing resemblance to him, to star in his life story. Warners first offered him the role but Astaire turned it down because Cohan's eccentric, stiff-legged dancing was far removed from Astaire's own, more fluid, style.[6] | James Cagney reprised the role of George M. Cohan in the movie The Seven Little Foys (1955), but agreed only on the condition that he receive no money – he did the film as a tribute to Eddie Foy. In Yankee Doodle Dandy, Eddie Foy, Jr. played the role of his own father. In The Seven Little Foys, Bob Hope portrayed Foy; Charley Foy (son of Eddie Foy, Jr.) served as a narrator. | Actress Jeanne Cagney, who played the part of Cohan's sister, was James Cagney's real-life sister.[7] Cagney's brother, William Cagney, was the Associate Producer of the film.[8] | Rosemary DeCamp, who played the mother of George M. Cohan, was, in fact, 11 years younger than Cagney.[9] | President Franklin D. Roosevelt was played by Captain Jack Young, a lookalike who is seen only from the back. An impressionist, Art Gilmore, provided the voice of Roosevelt, uncredited.[10] Gilmore would narrate the Joe McDoakes film shorts produced by Warners, and became a well-known announcer on television through the 1970s. | Uncredited cast members include Eddie Acuff, Murray Alper, Ward Bond, Walter Brooke, Georgia Carroll, Glen Cavender, Spencer Charters, Wallis Clark, William B.

The star earned his contractual $150,000 salary and nearly half a million dollars in profit sharing.[15] According to Variety magazine, the film earned $4.8 million in theatrical rentals through its North American release.[16] | Contemporary reviews were highly positive. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said that film patrons would do well to see it, for \"you will find as warm and delightful a musical picture as has hit the screen in years, a corking good entertainment and as affectionate, if not as accurate, a film biography as has ever—yes, ever—been made ... there is so much in this picture and so many persons that deserve their meed of praise that every one connected with it can stick a feather in his hat and take our word—it's dandy!\"[17] Variety called the film \"as entertaining as any top filmusical ever made ... James Cagney does a Cohan of which the original George M. might well be proud.\"[18] Harrison's Reports wrote: \"Excellent! Audiences should find this musical comedy, which is based on the life of George M. Cohan, one of the most sparkling and delightful musical pictures that have ever been brought to the screen. Much of its entertainment value is due to the exceptionally fine performance of James Cagney, whose impersonation of Mr. Cohan is uncanny—his gestures, his talk, and his dancing, are done to perfection.\"[19] John Mosher of The New Yorker called the film \"a complete delight, an extravaganza of tunes the country has liked for decades,\" although he considered it \"dubious\" as a biography of Cohan.[20] | The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (James Cagney), Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound, Recording (Nathan Levinson). It was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Walter Huston), Best Director, Best Film Editing for George Amy, Best Picture and Best Writing, Original Story.[21] In 1993, Yankee Doodle Dandy was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". | American Film Institute recognition | 1998: AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies - #100 | 2004: AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs - #71 The Yankee Doodle Boy | 2005: AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes: \"My mother thanks you.

Cohan’s life, having disliked Cohan since the Actors’ Equity Strike in 1919, in which he sided with the producers. In 1940, Cagney was named, along with 15 other Hollywood figures, in the grand jury testimony of John R. Leech, the self-described ‘chief functionary’ of the Los Angeles Communist Party who had been subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). The New York Times printed the allegation that Cagney was a communist on its front page. Cagney refuted the accusation and Martin Dies, Jr. made a statement to the press clearing Cagney. William Cagney, one of the film's producers, is reported to have said to his brother that \"we’re going to have to make the goddamndest patriotic picture that’s ever been made. I think it’s the Cohan story\".[13]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Curtiz","m_produced_by":"Hal B. Wallis Jack L.
