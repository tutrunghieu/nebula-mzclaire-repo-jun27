{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is divided into three parts. The first two, 1987 and 1988, each depict a day in the family's life, showing their daily activities in detail. It conveys their discomfort with the sterile routines of modern society. Toward the beginning of each part, there is a voice over of the wife reading a letter to the husband's parents informing them of his success at work. Many of the same activities are shown in both parts. | The third part, 1989, begins with the family departing from the grandparents' home after a visit. The husband then narrates a letter, written the next day, informing them he and his wife have quit their jobs and decided \"to leave\". It plays over clips of them quitting, closing their bank account, telling the clerk they are emigrating to Australia, selling their car, and buying a large variety of cutting tools. He then says it was a very hard decision whether or not to take Eva with them, but they decided to do so after she said she was not afraid of death. | The family then eats a luxurious meal, and goes about systematically destroying every possession in the house, but in an automatic and lifeless manner, with barely any speaking (as are almost all of their actions in the movie). They rip up all of their money and flush it down the toilet. The only emotion shown is when Georg shatters their large fish tank, and his daughter screams and cries hysterically. Finally, they commit suicide, first Eva, then Anna, and finally Georg. Just before he dies, Georg is shown methodically writing the names, date, and time of death of all three family members on the wall. There is an envelope addressed to Georg's parents taped to the door. | At the end of the film, there is text saying that, despite the suicide note, Georg's parents thought it may have been a homicide and a police investigation was conducted. No evidence of murder was found.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film was awarded Bronze Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival and the prize for Best Application of Music and Sound in Film at the Ghent International Film Festival.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Haneke","m_produced_by":"Veit Heiduschka","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dieter Berner Birgit Doll Leni Tanzer","m_music_by":"Alban Berg","m_cinematography":"Anton Peschke","m_edited_by":"Marie Homolkova","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"1989 (1989) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes","m_country":"Austria","m_language":"German | The Seventh Continent (German: Der siebente Kontinent) is a 1989 Austrian drama film directed by Michael Haneke.

They lead routine urban middle-class lives, with hopes of escaping to Australia to start a new life, but suddenly decide to destroy themselves without any apparent reason.
