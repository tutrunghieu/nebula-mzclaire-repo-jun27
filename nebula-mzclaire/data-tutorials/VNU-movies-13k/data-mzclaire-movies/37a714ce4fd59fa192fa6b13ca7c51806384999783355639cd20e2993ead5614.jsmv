In the meantime, Kevin debates the issue of violent crime in the U.S. with his teachers and others during the day. As Kevin and his gang head toward a final, bloody confrontation with the low-lifes who murdered his sister, other scenes show the difference between his character, now violent, and the people he is supposedly protecting.","m_cast":"Ernest Borgnine - Lieutenant Bob Carrigan | Richard Roundtree - Sergeant John Austin | Lynda Day George - Beverly Carrigan | James Van Patten - Kevin Carrigan | Anne Lockhart - Lucy | Tom Reilly - Scott | Ed De Stefane - Stan | Dick Shawn - Professor Hoover | Mike Norris - Fred | Linnea Quigley - Ginger","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lawrence D.
