Nils Beyer at Morgon-tidningen compared it to Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath. While finding Dreyer's films to be superior, he still noted that \"it isn't just any director that you feel like comparing to the old Danish master.\" He also praised the usage of the cast, in particular Max von Sydow whose character he described as \"a pale, serious Don Quixote character with a face as if sculpted in wood\", and \"Bibi Andersson, who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth.\" Hanserik Hjertén for Arbetaren started his review by praising the cinematography, but soon went on to describe the film as \"a horror film for children\" and that beyond the superficial, it reminds a lot of Bergman's \"sophomoric films from the 40s.\"[13] | Bosley Crowther had only positive things to say in his 1958 review for The New York Times, and praised how the themes were elevated by the cinematography and acting: \"the profundities of the ideas are lightened and made flexible by glowing pictorial presentation of action that is interesting and strong. Mr. Bergman uses his camera and actors for sharp, realistic effects.\"[40] | The film has been regarded since its release as a masterpiece of cinema.[41] Empire magazine ranked it the eighth-greatest film of world cinema in 2010.[42] In a poll held by the same magazine, it was voted 335th 'Greatest Movie of All Time' from a list of 500.[43] In addition, on the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995, the Vatican included The Seventh Seal in its list of its 45 \"great films\" for its thematic values.[44] | The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 30th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[45]","m_production":"Bergman originally wrote the play Trämålning (Wood Painting) in 1953/1954 for the acting students of Malmö City Theatre. The first time it was performed in public was in radio in 1954, directed by Bergman. He also directed it on stage in Malmö the next spring, and in the autumn it was staged in Stockholm, directed by Bengt Ekerot who would later play the character Death in the film version.[13] | In his autobiography, The Magic Lantern, Bergman wrote that \"Wood Painting gradually became The Seventh Seal, an uneven film which lies close to my heart, because it was made under difficult circumstances in a surge of vitality and delight.\"[14] The script for the Seventh Seal was commenced while Bergman was in the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm recovering from a stomach complaint.[15] It was at first rejected[who?] and Bergman was given the go-ahead for the project from Carl-Anders Dymling at Svensk Filmindustri only after the success at Cannes of Smiles of a Summer Night[16] Bergman rewrote the script five times and was given a schedule of only thirty-five days and a budget of $150,000.[17] It was to be the seventeenth film he had directed.[18] | All scenes except two were shot in or around the Filmstaden studios in Solna. The exceptions were the famous opening scene with Death and the Knight playing chess by the sea and the ending with the dance of death, which were both shot at Hovs Hallar, a rocky, precipitous beach area in north-western Scania.[19] | In the Magic Lantern autobiography Bergman writes of the film's iconic penultimate shot: \"The image of the Dance of Death beneath the dark cloud was achieved at hectic speed because most of the actors had finished for the day. Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who never knew what it was all about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death. A camera with no sound was set up and the picture shot before the cloud dissolved.\"[20]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Trämålning  by Ingmar Bergman","m_directed_by":"Ingmar Bergman","m_produced_by":"Allan Ekelund","m_screenplay_by":"Ingmar Bergman","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Gunnar Björnstrand | Bengt Ekerot | Nils Poppe | Max von Sydow | Bibi Andersson | Inga Landgré | Åke Fridell","m_music_by":"Erik Nordgren","m_cinematography":"Gunnar Fischer","m_edited_by":"Lennart Wallén","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"AB Svensk Filmindustri","m_release_dates":"16 February 1957 (1957-02-16) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 minutes[1]","m_country":"Sweden","m_language":"Swedish | Latin","m_budget":"$150,000[2] | The Seventh Seal (Swedish: Det sjunde inseglet) is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden[3][4] during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play Wood Painting. The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\".[Rev. 8:1] Here the motif of silence refers to the \"silence of God,\" which is a major theme of the film.[5][6] | The Seventh Seal is considered a classic of world cinema. It established Bergman as a world-renowned director, containing scenes which have become iconic through homages, critical analysis, and parodies. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE SEVENTH SEAL\".
