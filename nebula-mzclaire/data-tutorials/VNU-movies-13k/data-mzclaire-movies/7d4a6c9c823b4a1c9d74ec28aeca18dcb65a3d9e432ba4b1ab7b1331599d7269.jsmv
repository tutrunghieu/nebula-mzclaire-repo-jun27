The group is split up when Sylvia announces that she is marrying an Briton and that they intend to move back to United Kingdom after the wedding, taking Mary with them. | Peter and Michael (joined later by Jack) travel to the UK, where Peter realizes that Sylvia's fiancé, Edward, intends to pack Mary off to a boarding school (Pileforth Academy) as he has no real interest in her. He denies everything and Sylvia refuses to believe Peter, knowing he has disliked Edward from the beginning. | An attraction between Peter and Sylvia is nevertheless growing, something he refuses to acknowledge. He breaks into Pileforth in an attempt to get proof of Edward's scheme to send Mary there. He is discovered by the headmistress, Miss Elspeth Lomax, who says she has been told by Edward that Peter is in love with her. She begins to take her clothes off and tries to have sex with him, but he manages to get away and later explains to her that Edward made up the fact that he had feelings for her, but apologizes for the misunderstanding. | Peter, with help from Miss Lomax, heads off to stop the wedding. To cause a delay, Michael has kidnapped the vicar and Jack disguises himself as an elderly replacement one. | Peter and Miss Lomax arrive at the church after numerous delays. He confronts Sylvia with the truth, Miss Lomax herself confirming that Edward has been lying. Sylvia confronts him and he admits the truth but it is too late--they are already married. Or so it would seems...until Jack reveals himself to everyone. Not only has he finally proved his acting skills, but the marriage is null and void. Edward is finally revealed to be the jerk he really is when he calls Mary a \"little shit\" to her face and Peter in turn punches him for insulting her. | Sylvia declares her intention to go home, but Peter stops her and declares his love.

However, Howe also criticized it, claiming Ted Danson and Steve Guttenburg were overshadowed for the remainder of the film.[3][4] | NeedACoffee.com has criticized the DVD for not having any special features or so much as a trailer.[5] Although Emile Ardolino's death in 1993 prevented him from providing any form of director's commentary, with no commentary provided by the actors or the crew, the site stated that overall, purchasing the DVD if one already owned a VHS copy of the movie was unnecessary. | The film currently holds a rating of 29% based on 14 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.com,[1] and holds a rating of 5.1 stars out of ten on IMDB.com based on 13 critic reviews.[6]","m_production":"Filmed on location in New York and the United Kingdom, the scenes in the latter location were primarily shot in Banbury in north Oxfordshire.
