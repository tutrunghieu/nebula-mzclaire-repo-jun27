When Jimmy utters \"Where am I?\", the magic jar pops open, and a strange little man pops out. He introduces himself as Abu the Genie, and states that he has granted Jimmy his fondest wish: to be on a real pirate ship. Jimmy scoffs at the notion, but Abu insists that they are at that very moment passengers on Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the notorious Blackbeard.","m_cast":"Charles Herbert as Jimmy Warren | Susan Gordon as Katrina Van Keif / Kathy | Murvyn Vye as Blackbeard | Paul Guilfoyle as Snipe | Joe Turkel (as Joseph) as Abu the Genie | Archie Duncan as Scoggins | Than Wyenn as Hunter | Albert Cavens as Dutch Captain | Mickey Finn as Peake | Morgan Jones as Mr. Warren | Timothy Carey as Pirate Morgan","m_reception":null,"m_production":"\"Timothy Carey on this movie, probably scared me more than The Colossus of New York!\", says Charles Herbert. \"But he was a nice man, and he always tried to make you feel, 'I’m not really crazy,' and you would say, 'Okay.'

Gordon (\"Mr. B.I.G.\"), the master of giant monster films. It stars a very popular child star of the day in 12-year-old Charles Herbert and Gordon's own daughter, Susan. The story line, that of a little boy and girl trapped on the pirate ship of Blackbeard, ranges from comical at times to downright gruesome. There is a good deal of killing during the course of the film. The cook forces Jimmy at one point to take a fish and \"gut and clean it, and save his entrails\". There is another moment when Morgan the pirate tries to get Jimmy to reveal his coveted information by threatening to scald his mouth with a red-hot poker. | Nonetheless, it has been described as \"an engaging and innovative fantasy so perfect in its service to and embellishment of genre formula, it comes across as both completely familiar, yet breathtakingly original.\"[1] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"kiddiematinee.com / The Boy and the Pirates | Classic Images / Charles Herbert Interview","m_external_link":"The Boy and the Pirates at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/BoyPirates.jpg/220px-BoyPirates.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Bert I.
