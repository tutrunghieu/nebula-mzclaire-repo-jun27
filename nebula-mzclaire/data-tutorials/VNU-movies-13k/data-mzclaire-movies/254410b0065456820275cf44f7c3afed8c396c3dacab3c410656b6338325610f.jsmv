{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with a pre-credit sequence in which a group of unnamed terrorists have parked a vehicle containing a guided missile pointed straight at the Palace of Westminster whilst politicians are heard on the film's soundtrack. They are thwarted by a group of older women in a tour group who turn out to be cross-dressing commandos who eliminate the terrorists with sub-machine guns and grenades. They are led by Agent Charles Vine with his second-in-command being Lt. Guy Fawkes who has saved the Parliament of England. | The film proper begins with the Royal Air Force testing a secret light-weight metal called \"Spurium\" [2] that enables nuclear aircraft to fly. An unnamed sinister organisation led by a man named Angel hijacks the DC-3 aircraft by hypnotising the RAF Regiment guards and flying the plane to another location but they are shot down by the RAF. | Afraid the incident may happen again, Vine is assigned as security to the project. However Angel's organisation kidnap Vine and replace him with one of their own men named Seraph. Obtaining information before he escapes allows Seraph to steal a sample of Spurium to be sold to the Soviet Union; however the Russians believe he is double-crossing them and kills him. | Vine escapes and reports to the RAF airbase, where he meets his RAF counterpart, Flight Lieutenant Felicity \"Fiz\" Moonlight. Angel's men try an all-out assault on the airfield to capture the next nuclear aircraft set to fly. Vine and Angel end up in the nuclear aircraft that takes flight but Vine is rescued by F/L Moonlight.","m_cast":"Tom Adams - Charles Vine | Dawn Addams - Flt Lt Felicity 'Fiz' Moonlight | Michael Ripper - Angel | Tim Barrett - Seraph | Sid James - Mortuary Attendant | Wilfrid Brambell - Train Guard | Joe Baker - Minister | John Arnatt - Rockwell | Ronald Leigh-Hunt - Thursby | Marcus Hammond - O'Neil | Tony Arpino - Butler | Michael Balfour - Band Leader | Tom Bowman - Russian Colonel | Maurice Browning - Cherub | Michael James Cox - Lt.
