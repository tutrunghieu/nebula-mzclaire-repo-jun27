{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Upon its release on December 26, 1973, the film received mixed reviews from critics, “ranging from ‘classic’ to ‘claptrap'.\"[11] Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, wrote, “This is the most scary film I’ve seen in years — the only scary film I’ve seen in years…If you want to be shaken — and I found out, while the picture was going, that that’s what I wanted — then The Exorcist will scare the hell out of you.”[12] Variety noted that it was “an expert telling of a supernatural horror story…The climactic sequences assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror.”[13] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante opined, “[A]n amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director William Friedkin’s film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see…Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before.”[14] | However, Vincent Canby, writing in the New York Times, dismissed The Exorcist as “a chunk of elegant occultist claptrap…[A] practically impossible film to sit through…it establishes a new low for grotesque special effects...”[15] Andrew Sarris complained that “Friedkin’s biggest weakness is his inability to provide enough visual information about his characters…whole passages of the movie’s exposition were one long buzz of small talk and name droppings…The Exorcist succeeds on one level as an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film.”[16] Writing in Rolling Stone, Jon Landau felt the film was, “[N]othing more than a religious porn film, the gaudiest piece of shlock this side of Cecil B. DeMille (minus that gentleman’s wit and ability to tell a story) …”[17] | Over the years, The Exorcist’s critical reputation has grown considerably. The film currently has an 85% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 40 reviews the website collected.[18] Some critics regard it as being one of the best and most effective horror films; admirers say the film balances a stellar script, gruesome effects, and outstanding performances. However, the movie has its detractors as well, including Kim Newman who has criticized it for messy plot construction, conventionality and overblown pretentiousness, among other perceived defects. Writer James Baldwin provides an extended negative critique in his book length essay The Devil Finds Work. | II: Stephen H. Scheuer wrote that Exorcist II “may just well be the worst sequel in the history of films – a stupefying, boring, vapid and non-scary follow-up to the box-office champ of 1973...Exorcist II is a disaster on every level – a sophomoric script, terrible editing, worst direction by John Boorman, inevitably coupled with silly acting. In one scene that typifies this lamentable sci-fi horror pic, [Richard] Burton and [James Earl] Jones, two splendid actors, are spouting inane dialogue while Jones is outfitted like a witch doctor.”[19] Leslie Halliwell described the film as a “highly unsatisfactory psychic melodrama which...falls flat on its face along some wayward path of metaphysical and religious fancy. It was released in two versions and is unintelligible in either.”[20] Leonard Maltin described the film as a “preposterous sequel...Special effects are the only virtue in this turkey.”[21] Danny Peary dismissed Exorcist II as “absurd.”[22] | While most reviewers responded negatively to the film, Pauline Kael greatly preferred Boorman's sequel to the original, writing in her review in The New Yorker that Exorcist II \"had more visual magic than a dozen movies.\" Since Exorcist II's initial release, some notable critics and directors have praised the film. Kim Newman wrote in Nightmare Movies (1988) that \"it doesn't work in all sorts of ways... However, like Ennio Morricone's mix of tribal and liturgical music, it does manage to be very interesting.\" Director Martin Scorsese asserted, \"The picture asks: Does great goodness bring upon itself great evil? This goes back to the Book of Job; it's God testing the good. In this sense, Regan (Linda Blair) is a modern-day saint — like Ingrid Bergman in Europa '51, and in a way, like Charlie in Mean Streets. I like the first Exorcist, because of the Catholic guilt I have, and because it scared the hell out of me; but The Heretic surpasses it. Maybe Boorman failed to execute the material, but the movie still deserved better than it got.\"[23] | Author Bob McCabe's book The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows contains a chapter on the film in which Linda Blair said the movie \"was one of the big disappointments of my career,\"[24] and John Boorman confessed that “The sin I committed was not giving the audience what it wanted in terms of horror...There’s this wild beast out there which is the audience. I created this arena and I just didn’t throw enough Christians into it. People think of cutting and re-cutting as defeat, but it isn’t. As Irving Thalberg said: ‘Films aren’t made, they’re remade.’”[25] McCabe himself offered no one answer as to why Exorcist II failed: \"Who knows where the blame ultimately lies. Boorman's illness and constant revising of the script can't have helped, but these events alone are not enough to explain the film's almighty failure. Boorman has certainly gone on to produce some fine work subsequently...When a list was compiled to find the fifty worst films of all time, Exorcist II: The Heretic came in at number two. It was beaten only by Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space, a film that generally receives a warmer response from its audience than this terribly misjudged sequel.\"[26] | III:The film met with mixed reviews. New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby said \"The Exorcist III is a better and funnier (intentionally) movie than either of its predecessors\" [27] and British film critic Mark Kermode called it \"a restrained, haunting chiller which stimulates the adrenalin and intellect alike.\" [28] However Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review, stating \"If Part II sequels are generally disappointing, Part IIIs are often much, much worse. It can seem as if nothing is going on in them except dim murmurings about the original movie — murmurings that mostly remind you of what isn't being delivered.\" Gleiberman called The Exorcist III \"an ash-gray disaster\" and that it \"has the feel of a nightmare catechism lesson, or a horror movie made by a depressed monk.\"[29] Kim Newman claimed that \"The major fault in Exorcist III is the house-of-cards plot that is constantly collapsing.\"[30] Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times gave a mixed review, saying Exorcist III \"doesn't completely work but offers much more than countless, less ambitious films.\"[31]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"William Friedkin (The Exorcist) John Boorman (Exorcist II: The Heretic) William Peter Blatty (The Exorcist III) Renny Harlin (Exorcist: The Beginning) Paul Schrader (Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist)","m_produced_by":"Carter DeHaven John Boorman William Peter Blatty Noel Marshall","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"see individual articles","m_music_by":"Barry Devorzon Ennio Morricone Jack Nitzsche Mike Oldfield","m_cinematography":"Gerry Fisher William A.

In 2004, a prequel (Exorcist: The Beginning) was released. This was the second version of the prequel film made at that time as the first version (directed by Paul Schrader) was deemed unsatisfactory by the studio upon completion, and the entire project was refilmed by director Renny Harlin. However, Schrader's version received a limited release in 2005, after Harlin's, and was titled Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Fangoria #94 (July 1990) | ^ Fangoria #122 (May 1993) | ^ a b http://www.theninthconfiguration.com/ | ^ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6n0pgaYJVg Archived November 6, 2015, at the Wayback Machine. | ^ http://captainhowdy.com/?page_id=38&xdforum_action=viewthread&xf_id=1&xt_id=888&pstart=0 | ^ http://pages.zoom.co.uk/the.exorcist/Html/friedkin_faqs.htm | ^ Collectors' Tribute to the Film that Frightened the World!!!
