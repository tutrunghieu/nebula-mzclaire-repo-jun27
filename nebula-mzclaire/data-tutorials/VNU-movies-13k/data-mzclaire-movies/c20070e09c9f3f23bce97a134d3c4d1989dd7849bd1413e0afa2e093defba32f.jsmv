Shortly afterward, Byrne invited Henley and Tobolowsky over to his house and showed them a collection of hundreds of drawings he had made and put up on his wall. He explained they were based on clippings he had scrapbooked from tabloids as the band had been on tour. He had been intrigued by the idea of making a movie based on the premise, \"What if all these stories were true?\" and wanted Henley and Tobolowsky to write the script based on those drawings.[2] | Tobolowsky was aware that Texas was coming up on its sesquicentennial celebration, and thought that would provide a good framework for the characters Byrne had invented. He and Henley wrote a draft and provided it to Byrne, then did not hear back from him for about a year. It later turned out that Byrne had rewritten their script almost entirely, keeping only a few lines and the sesquicentennial framework from the first draft. However, he asked Tobolowsky and Henley for permission to list their names ahead of his as scriptwriters so the movie would seem less like a \"vanity project.\"[2] | During Tobolowsky's early talks with Byrne, he related to Byrne the story of a series of psychic experiences he had during college, in which he had been able to hear \"tones\" that told him things about other people. Byrne incorporated this story into his rewrite, using it as the basis for Ramon's psychic powers and the song \"Radio Head.\"[2] | An early working title for the project (endorsed by bassist Tina Weymouth) was Wild Infancy.[3] Locations for the filming took place in Dallas and its suburbs Allen, McKinney, Mesquite, and Red Oak.[4] The interior mall and fashion show scene was filmed in NorthPark Center in North Dallas,[citation needed] while the exterior mall was filmed at the now demolished Big Town Mall in Mesquite.[citation needed] The parade scene at the end of the film includes various local groups including the Tejas Low Riders Club, and the Sunset High School Marching Band.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Byrne","m_produced_by":"Gary Kurfirst","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Goodman Annie McEnroe Swoosie Kurtz Spalding Gray Pop Staples Tito Larriva David Byrne","m_music_by":"Talking Heads","m_cinematography":"Ed Lachman","m_edited_by":"Caroline Biggerstaff","m_production_company":"True Stories Venture Warner Bros.","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"October 10, 1986 (US)","m_running_time":"90 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$2,545,142 | True Stories is a 1986 American film that spans the genres of musical, art, and comedy, directed by and starring David Byrne of the band Talking Heads. It co-stars John Goodman, Swoosie Kurtz, and Spalding Gray. Byrne has described the film as, \"A project with songs based on true stories from tabloid newspapers. It's like 60 Minutes on acid.\"[1] | True Stories was released by Warner Bros. in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Sweden in 1986, with limited release elsewhere the following year. Byrne was given much creative control over the motion picture's direction, largely due to the mainstream success of Talking Heads' 1984 concert film, Stop Making Sense. | The majority of the film's music is supplied by Talking Heads. A soundtrack album, titled Sounds From True Stories, featured songs by Byrne, Talking Heads, and Terry Allen & The Panhandle Mystery Band, among others. Around the same time, Talking Heads released an album, titled True Stories, which included the band's versions of songs featured in the film. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"David Byrne Interview\".
