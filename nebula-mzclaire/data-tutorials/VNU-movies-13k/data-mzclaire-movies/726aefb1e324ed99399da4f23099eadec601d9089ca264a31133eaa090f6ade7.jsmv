Add to this conflict in styles the film's confused intentions -- black comedy, the horrific realities of reform schools, a sentimental belief that understanding will overcome - and you have a mess.\"[5]","m_production":"Although the film was shot in Britain it was financed in the United States.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Silvio Narizzano","m_produced_by":"Judd Bernard","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Glenda Jackson | Oliver Reed | Michael Murphy","m_music_by":"Stanley Myers","m_cinematography":"Alex Thomson","m_edited_by":"Max Benedict","m_production_company":"Kettledrum Films","m_distributed_by":"Gala Film Distributors","m_release_dates":"27 January 1979 (1979-01-27) (USA) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Class of Miss MacMichael is a 1978 British comedy drama film directed by Silvio Narizzano and starring Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed and Michael Murphy.[1] It was based on a novel by Sandy Hutson.
