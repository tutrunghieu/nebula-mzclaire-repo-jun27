{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Kadam family ran a restaurant in Mumbai. The second-oldest son, Hassan (Manish Dayal), was being groomed to replace his mother (Juhi Chawla) as the restaurant's main cook. However, a mob attacks and firebombs the restaurant over an election dispute. Papa Kadam (Om Puri) and his family evacuate the guests, but Mama is killed. Seeking asylum in Europe, the family first settles in London, where their residence proves ill-suited for a restaurant. They depart for mainland Europe. | Shortly after entering France, the brakes on Papa's van fail near Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in the Midi-Pyrénées. Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), a sous chef at an upscale French restaurant named \"Le Saule Pleureur\" (\"The Weeping Willow\"), passes by and offers to help the Kadams find an auto repair shop and a guest house. She brings the Kadams to her apartment and treats them to cold food. Papa is amazed at the quality of the food in the village and its availability and discovers that Marguerite made the food herself. | Papa learns of an abandoned restaurant building available for purchase. It's located directly across the street—only 100 feet—from Le Saule Pleureur. Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren), Le Saule Pleureur's owner, asks the Kadams to leave because it is \"private property\". Papa buys the property, even though the rest of his family is against it, and names the restaurant \"Maison Mumbai\". | Mallory comes over to Maison Mumbai to ask for a menu and then buys all the locally available ingredients needed to cook their dishes on opening night. A cold war erupts between Papa and Mallory. The war peaks on Bastille Day when one of Mallory's chefs, Jean-Pierre, and two others vandalize the Kadams' restaurant by spray-painting words which translate to \"France for the French\" on the outer wall and firebombing the interior. Hassan catches the arsonists in the act and scares them off, but his hands and legs are burned. The following morning Mallory, who knew nothing of the arson and vandalism, dismisses Jean-Pierre and personally cleans the graffiti from Maison Mumbai. | Hassan, having heard from Marguerite that Mallory hires potential chefs by taste-testing an omelette and deciding whether the person is indeed a great chef, asks if he may cook an omelette for her to his recipe. Due to his injured hands, Mallory helps under Hassan's supervision. After tasting the omelette, Mallory recognizes Hassan's potential and invites him to work for her. Papa is initially against the move, but ultimately strikes a deal with her as to Hassan's pay. | Hassan's cooking results in Mallory's restaurant receiving its second Michelin star. The award draws national attention to Hassan's cooking, and he is offered and accepts a job in Paris. Papa and Mallory make amends and begin seeing each other. | Hassan's cooking in Paris quickly receives critical acclaim, fueling speculation of a third Michelin Star for the Paris restaurant, but his work is increasingly bogged down by thoughts of his family and Marguerite (with whom he had an ongoing romance). Hassan returns home and reunites with Marguerite. He invites Marguerite to join him in a business venture—buying a stake in Mallory's restaurant, along with operational control. Hassan believes this will help the restaurant earn its third star. That evening, Hassan and Marguerite prepare dinner at Mallory's restaurant and bring the dishes across the road to the courtyard of Maison Mumbai for all to enjoy.","m_cast":"Helen Mirren as Madame Mallory | Om Puri as Papa | Manish Dayal as Hassan Rohan Chand as young Hassan | Charlotte Le Bon as Marguerite | Amit Shah as Mansur | Farzana Dua Elahe as Mahira | Dillon Mitra as Mukthar | Aria Pandya as Aisha | Michel Blanc as Mayor | Shuna Lemoine as Mayor's wife | Clément Sibony as Jean-Pierre | Juhi Chawla as Mama | Vincent Elbaz as Paul, Manager of the Parisian molecular cuisine restaurant","m_reception":"The film grossed $10,979,290 in its opening weekend in the USA, finishing in 4th.

Morais' novel The Hundred-Foot Journey about two rival restaurants in France.[5] Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Juliet Blake produced the film adaptation scripted by Steven Knight.[6] In an interview, Winfrey was quoted, \"Food blends cultures and allows us to have just a little peek into someone else's life... It is about a hundred foot divide between cultures.\"[7] Winfrey chose the book on which the film is based as a \"favorite summer read\" in 2010. She said, \"It’s about human beings coming to understand other human beings and more importantly, after you get to experience or step into somebody else’s shoes or see them for a real human being, how you understand that you’re really more alike than you are different\"[4] Mr. Sanjeev Lamba the CEO of Reliance Big Entertainment stated that the film was a much celebrated release and is a close partnership with DreamWorks, reflecting a cross country association.[8] | On June 3, 2013, Helen Mirren was in negotiations to join the cast.[6] On July 1, DreamWorks confirmed the casting of Mirren and Manish Dayal.[9] | Principal photography began on September 23, 2013, in southern France,[10] in Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val,[11][12] lasted for nine weeks and proceeded in The Netherlands [13] and in the Cité du Cinéma studio complex, located in Saint-Denis, north of Paris.[14]The Hundred Foot Journey was extensively shot at scenic locales of Midi-Pyrénées.[8] Prior to actual filming, actors Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon spent a considerable amount of time going to restaurants and observing and learning in kitchens.[15] To sign off on the food featured in the film, producer Juliet Blake consulted Indian-born chef Floyd Cardoz who understands “fusing together two cultures through cooking.”[15] Indian actress Juhi Chawla plays Om Puri's character's wife in the film. The makers felt the need for her to look 15 years older than her present age.
