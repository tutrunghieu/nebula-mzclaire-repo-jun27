I wanted to hide it, like the old filmmakers in the studio system did. Hide it behind a genre.

That's not what it was about, that was just the disguise I hung my hat on.\"[3] | \"Audrey Hepburn’s story in the movie is Audrey Hepburn’s story in life,\" said the director. \"She was living with a man, her second husband, he was cheating on her, and she basically stayed with him because of the child.\"[2] | The movie was shot on location in New York. Bogdanovich would often write scenes and give them to the actors just before they were shot, to give the movie a feeling of freshness.[3] | Country music is prominently featured. According to Bogdanovich, in the first version of the script, the character of Christy was going to be a jazz singer, singing jazz standards, but then: | There was a short, very short, very brief, vogue of country music in New York. About 30 seconds. And so I changed it. I like country music. I fell in love with it on Last Picture Show. In fact, I wrote a couple of country songs. The phrase “One Day Since Yesterday” was something Dorothy said to me in a card. I liked the phrase.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Peter Bogdanovich","m_produced_by":"George Morfogen Blain Novak","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Audrey Hepburn Ben Gazzara John Ritter Colleen Camp Patti Hansen Dorothy Stratten Blaine Novak","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Robby Müller","m_edited_by":"William C.
