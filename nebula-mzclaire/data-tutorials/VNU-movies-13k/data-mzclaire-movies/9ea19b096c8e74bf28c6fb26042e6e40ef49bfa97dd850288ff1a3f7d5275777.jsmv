{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the 1880s, an English couple and their infant son escape a burning ship, ending up on land near uncharted rainforests off the coast of Africa. The couple craft themselves a treehouse from their ship's wreckage, but are subsequently killed by Sabor, a rogue leopardess. Kala, a female mountain gorilla who recently lost her own child to Sabor, hears the cries of the orphaned human infant and finds him in the ruined treehouse. Though she is attacked by Sabor, Kala and the baby manage to escape. Kala takes the baby back to the gorilla troop to raise as her own, an act of which her mate, Kerchak, disapproves. Kala raises the human child, naming him Tarzan. Though he befriends other gorillas in the troop and other animals, including the young female gorilla named Terk and the paranoid male elephant called Tantor, Tarzan finds himself unable to keep up with them, so he takes great efforts to improve himself. As a young man, Tarzan is able to kill Sabor with his crude spear and protect the troop, gaining Kerchak's reluctant respect. | The gorilla troop's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Porter, his daughter Jane, and their hunter-guide Clayton. Jane is accidentally separated from the group and chased by a pack of baboons, and Tarzan saves her. He recognizes that she is the same as he is: a human. Jane leads Tarzan back to the explorers' camp, where both Porter and Clayton take great interest in him — the former in terms of scientific progress while the latter hoping to have Tarzan lead him to the gorillas so that he can capture them and return with them to England. Despite Kerchak's warnings to be wary of the humans, Tarzan continues to return to the camp and be taught by Porter, Clayton, and Jane to speak English and learn of the human world, and he and Jane begin to fall in love. However, they are having a hard time convincing Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas, due to Tarzan's fear for their safety from the threat of Kerchak. | The explorers' ship returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan in turn asks Jane to stay with him when Jane explains the unlikelihood of ever returning to Tarzan's home. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him forever if he reveals the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the party to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to avoid having him attack the humans. Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns and threatens to kill them. Tarzan is forced to hold Kerchak at bay while the humans escape, and decides to leave the troop himself, now humiliated by his actions. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse she found him in, shows him his true past, and tells him that she wants him to be happy whatever he decided. Tarzan puts on a suit that belonged to his Father, signifying his decision to go to England. When Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter the next day, they are ambushed by Clayton and his band of stowaway thugs and detained in the brig. Tarzan flees with the help of his friends, and he races back to the gorillas' home ground. Clayton mortally wounds Kerchak and then engages Tarzan in a fierce battle across the vine-covered trees. Although Tarzan spares his life, Clayton inadvertently lynches himself when he falls with a vine tangled around his neck. Kerchak, in his dying breath, finally accepts Tarzan as his own and names him as leader of the gorilla troop. The rest of the gorillas are freed after scaring away the rest of Clayton's men. | The next day, as Porter and Jane prepare to leave on the ship, Tarzan reveals that he now plans to stay with the gorilla troop. As the ship leaves shore, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with the man she loves, and Jane jumps overboard to return to shore; Porter shortly follows her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and his family and embark on their new life together.","m_cast":"Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan, a man raised by gorillas who finds out he is truly a human.

During the weekend of June 18–21, Tarzan grossed $34.1 million ranking first on its opening weekend notably grossing higher than Mulan and A Bug's Life in their respective box office weekends,[39] and ranked second in Disney animated box office openings behind The Lion King, which earned $40.9 million.[40] By August 1999, the domestic gross was projected to approach $170 million,[41] whereas in the following month, Disney executives expected the film to gross between $450 million to $500 million worldwide.[42] Ultimately, the film closed its box office run with $448,191,819 worldwide.[2] | Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 104 reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10. The critical consensus reads that \"Disney's Tarzan takes the well-known story to a new level with spirited animation, a brisk pace, and some thrilling action set-pieces.\"[43] Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 79 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[44] | Entertainment Weekly compared the film's advancement in visual effects to that of The Matrix, stating that it had \"the neatest computer-generated background work since Keanu Reeves did the backstroke in slow motion.\" They elaborate by describing how the characters moved seamlessly through the backgrounds themselves, giving the film a unique three-dimensional feel that far surpassed the quality of previous live-action attempts.[45] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars, and he had similar comments about the film, describing it as representing \"another attempt by Disney to push the envelope of animation\", with scenes that \"move through space with a freedom undreamed of in older animated films, and unattainable by any live-action process.\"[46] Awarding the film three stars, James Berardinelli wrote: \"From a purely visual standpoint, this may be the most impressive of all of Disney's traditionally animated features. The backdrops are lush, the characters are well realized, and the action sequences are dizzying, with frequent changes of perspectives and camera angles. No conventional animated film has been this ambitious before.\"[47] Desson Howe, writing for The Washington Post, claimed the film \"isn't up there with Aladdin, The Lion King and The Little Mermaid, but it's easily above the riffraff ranks of Hercules and Pocahontas.\"[48] Todd McCarthy of Variety proved to be less amused by the animation, claiming it was \"richly detailed and colorfully conceived, but the computer animation and graphics are often intermingled and combined in ways that are more distracting in their differences than helpful in their vividness.\"[49] | Lisa Schwarzbaum, who graded the film an A-, applauded the film as \"a thrilling saga about a natural man, untainted by the complications of 'civilized' life, who can anticipate changes in the air by sniffing the wind — swings because the Disney team, having sniffed the wind, went out on a limb and kept things simple.\"[50] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle admired the film for tackling \"meanings of family relationships and ideas about society, guardianship and compassion\" and \"cunning and greed and the ultimate evil\", as well as remaining faithful to Burroughs's original novel.[51] Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times wrote that the \"story unfolds with dangers as well as warm humor; a jungle jam session called 'Trashin' the Camp' is especially hard to resist. We may have seen it all before, but when it's done up like this, experiencing it all over again is a pleasure.\"[52] In similarity, Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, opined that \"Tarzan initially looks and sounds like more of the same, to the point where Phil Collins is singing the words 'trust your heart' by the third line of his opening song. But it proves to be one of the more exotic blooms in the Disney hothouse, what with voluptuous flora, hordes of fauna, charming characters and excitingly kinetic animation that gracefully incorporates computer-generated motion.\"[53] | The Radio Times review was not positive, stating the film \"falls way short of Disney's best output\" and featured \"weak comic relief\". The review concluded: \"Lacking the epic sweep of Mulan or The Lion King, and laced with feeble background songs from Phil Collins (inexplicably awarded an Oscar), this King of the Swingers may be merchandise-friendly, but it's no jungle VIP.\"[54] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune, while giving the film three stars, wrote that Tarzan \"lacks that special pizazz that the string of Disney cartoon features from The Little Mermaid through The Lion King all had\". He found faults in the film's politically correct storyline, lack of romantic tension between Tarzan and Jane, and the songs by Phil Collins, comparing them unfavorably with Elton John's \"showstoppers\" for The Lion King. He wrote \"depriving the characters of big numbers weakens the movie\".[55] | Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave the soundtrack a B-, stating that it was awkwardly split between Collins's songs and the traditional score, was burdened by too many alternate versions of the tracks, and in some instances bore similarities to The Lion King and Star Wars.[56] | Tarzan was also nominated for 11 Annie Awards, winning one in the category for Technical Achievement in the Field of Animation. The award was given to Eric Daniels, who developed the Deep Canvas animation process for the film.[60] Phil Collins was nominated for a Kids Choice Award for his song \"Two Worlds\", but lost to Will Smith's song \"Wild Wild West.\" Rosie O'Donnell, the host of the 2000 Kids Choice Awards, was nominated for her voicework as Tarzan's best friend, Terk. She won the award for Favorite Voice From an Animated Movie, beating out both Tim Allen and Tom Hanks, the voices of Buzz Lightyear and Woody from Toy Story 2.[61] | American Film Institute Recognitions: | AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs: You'll Be in My Heart—Nominated[62] | AFI's 10 Top 10—Nominated Animated Film[63]","m_production":"Disney's Tarzan was the first Tarzan film to be animated.[5] Thomas Schumacher, the President of Feature Animation, expressed surprise that there weren't any previous attempts to animate a Tarzan film, saying \"Here is a book that cries out to be animated. Yet we're the first filmmakers to have ever taken Tarzan from page to screen and presented the character as Burroughs intended.\"[4] He noted that in animated form, Tarzan is able to connect to the animals on a deeper level than he can in live action versions.[4] | Following work on A Goofy Movie in late 1994, Kevin Lima was approached to direct Tarzan by studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg who desired to have the film animated at a Canadian-based satellite television animation studio, in which Lima was reluctant to do because of the animation complexities being done by inexperienced animators. Following Katzenberg's resignation from the Walt Disney Company, Lima was again contacted about the project by Michael Eisner, who decided to have the film produced through the Feature Animation division by which Lima signed on.[6] Following this, Lima decided to read Tarzan of the Apes where he began to visualize the theme of two hands being held up against each other.[7] That image became an important symbol of the relationships between characters in the film, and a metaphor of Tarzan's search for identity. \"I was looking for something that would underscore Tarzan's sense of being alike, yet different from his ape family,\" Lima said, \"The image of touching hands was first conceived as an idea for how Tarzan realizes he and Jane are physically the same.\"[4] Following his two-month study of the book, Lima approached his friend, Chris Buck, who had just wrapped up work as a supervising animator on Pocahontas, to ask if he would be interested in serving as co-director. Buck was initially skeptical, but accepted after hearing Lima's ideas for the film.[8] By April 1995, the Los Angeles Times reported that the film was in its preliminary stages with Lima and Buck directing after Disney had obtained the story rights from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs.[9] | Tab Murphy, who had just finished work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame, was attracted to the theme of man-versus-nature in Tarzan, and began developing a treatment in January 1995. For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.[4] In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe.[7] | In January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo Bob Tzudiker and Noni White were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.[7] Comedy writer Dave Reynolds was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.[10] \"I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up,\" Reynolds said, \"A year and a half later, I finished. Either they liked my work, or I was very bad at time management.\"[4] One challenge the writers faced was how Tarzan should learn about his past. \"When Kala takes Tarzan back to the tree house, she is essentially telling him that he was adopted,\" Bonnie Arnold, the producer for Tarzan, said, \"This is necessitated by him encountering humans and recognizing he is one of them.\"[4] As a way to explore the feelings in that scene, Arnold brought in adoptive parents to talk with the story team.[4] Another issue was the inherent and overt racism in the original Edgar Rice Rurrough's Tarzan. The writers consciously chose to not include any African characters in order to avoid this topic. | Brendan Fraser auditioned twice for the title character before portraying the lead role in George of the Jungle.[11] Tony Goldwyn auditioned for the title role as well, and according to co-director Kevin Lima, Goldwyn landed it because of \"the animal sense\" in his readings, along with some \"killer baboon imitations.\"[12] For the signature Tarzan yell, Lima and Buck desired the traditional yell, although Goldwyn faced difficulties with providing the yell stating \"It's really hard to do, physically.\" Co-star Brian Blessed ultimately provided the yell.[13] Terk was originally written as a male gorilla, but following Rosie O'Donnell's audition, Terk was re-characterized as a female.[14] | The animators were split into two teams, one in Paris and one in Burbank. The 6000 mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. Glen Keane was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.[4] Meanwhile, two hundred animators at the Feature Animation Florida satellite studio provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.[15] | Keane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor on anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.[4] | To prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.[4] In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.[16] | To create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, Tarzan's production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as Deep Canvas (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).[17] This technique allows artists to produce CGI background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director Daniel St. Pierre.[17] (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)[17] For this advancement, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded the creators of Deep Canvas a Technical Achievement Award in 2003. After Tarzan, Deep Canvas was used for a number of sequences in Atlantis: The Lost Empire, particularly large panoramic shots of the island and several action sequences. Expanded to support moving objects as part of the background, Deep Canvas was used to create about 75 percent of the environments in Disney's next major animated action film, Treasure Planet.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Tarzan of the Apes  by Edgar Rice Burroughs","m_directed_by":"Kevin Lima | Chris Buck","m_produced_by":"Bonnie Arnold","m_screenplay_by":"Tab Murphy | Bob Tzudiker | Noni White","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tony Goldwyn | Minnie Driver | Glenn Close | Alex D.

The 37th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, it is based on the story Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and is the first animated major motion picture version of the Tarzan story. Directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima with a screenplay by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, and Noni White, Tarzan features the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, and Rosie O'Donnell with Brian Blessed, Lance Henriksen, Wayne Knight, and Nigel Hawthorne. | Pre-production of Tarzan began in 1995 with Kevin Lima selected as director,[3] being later joined by animator Chris Buck the same year. Following a first draft by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, Noni White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to re-construct the third act and add additional humor to the screenplay. English musician Phil Collins was recruited to compose and record songs which were integrated with a score by Mark Mancina. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to Uganda and Kenya to study the gorillas. Animation for the film was done in California, Orlando, Florida, and Paris with Deep Canvas, the pioneering computer animation software system, predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds. | Tarzan was released to a positive reaction from critics who praised the film's animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until Disney's Treasure Planet (2002) which cost $140 million), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, second-highest animation release of 1999 behind Toy Story 2 (1999), and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since Pocahontas (1995). The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation, a television series The Legend of Tarzan, and two direct-to-video follow-ups—the sequel Tarzan & Jane (2002) and the midquel Tarzan II: The Legend Begins (2005). |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Tarzan\".
