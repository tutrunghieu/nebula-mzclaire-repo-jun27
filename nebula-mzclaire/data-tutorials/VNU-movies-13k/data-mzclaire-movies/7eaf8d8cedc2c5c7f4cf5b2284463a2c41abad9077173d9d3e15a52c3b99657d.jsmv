{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"At an American college, a group of students play a game with suction cup dart toy guns similar to The 10th Victim where a pair of students are assigned to \"kill\" the other one first by shooting him with a dart. One student, Loren Gersh (Bruce Abbott) lives purely to play the game with his expertise in \"killing\" all of his opponents and not being \"killed\" himself making him a renowned master. | When one of his cringing victims accidentally drops his dart gun, it goes off and hits Gersh, \"killing\" him. Faced with the embarrassment of losing his reputation by a geek getting lucky, Gersh really kills his opponent, setting him on the goal to use actual weapons and real killing from then on. His opponents in the game are unaware of Gersh's new rules. | Gersh slowly transforms from an average student to a James Bond-type killer.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"One of Gersh's planned victims is Susan Swayze, played by Linda Hamilton.
