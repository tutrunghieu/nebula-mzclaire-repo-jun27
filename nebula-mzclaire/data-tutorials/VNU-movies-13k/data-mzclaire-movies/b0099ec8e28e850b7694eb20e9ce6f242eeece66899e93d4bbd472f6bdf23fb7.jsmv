{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attempts to assassinate the President of the United States but fails and escapes. Meanwhile, Wolverine returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, while fellow X-Men Storm and Jean Grey find Nightcrawler with the help of the mutant-tracking machine Cerebro. | Xavier and Cyclops visit Magneto in his plastic prison cell, inquiring about the assassination attempt, and Xavier discovers that covert government operative, William Stryker, has been extracting information about Cerebro from a brainwashed Magneto using an injectable drug. Stryker and his assistant Yuriko Oyama capture Cyclops and Xavier and raid Xavier's school. Wolverine kills many of Stryker's men, while Colossus, Rogue, Iceman, Pyro, and most of the students escape through hidden tunnels. Wolverine confronts Stryker, who fails to shed light on Wolverine's past. Iceman helps Wolverine escape, but Stryker's soldiers succeed in sedating six students and breaking into Cerebro. | Impersonating Senator Robert Kelly and Yuriko, the shape-shifting Mystique gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape, and also learns of plans of another Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in Boston. Responding to a 9-1-1 call from Bobby's brother Ronny, the police arrive just as the group is leaving. Pyro uses his fire-projection power to fend off the police. | The X-Jet arrives to pick them up, and is targeted by two Air Force F-16 fighter jets. They are hit by a missile, but Magneto saves their jet from crashing. Magneto informs them that Stryker orchestrated the attack on the president to provide rationale to raid Xavier's school in order to steal Cerebro's parts, and plans to connect Xavier to another Cerebro rebuilt at a secret base. The X-Men decide to team up with Magneto and Mystique to stop Stryker. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is inside the dam at Alkali Lake. | Through his son, Jason, Stryker gains control over Xavier, who is brainwashed to use the second Cerebro to find and kill all mutants. Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base by impersonating Wolverine, and Storm and Nightcrawler search for the students. Jean, Magneto, and Mystique are attacked by a brainwashed Cyclops while trying to rescue Xavier, and cause damage to the generators that keep the dam from collapsing in the process. The force of Jean's telekinetic blast clashing with Cyclops' optic blast awakens him from his brainwashing, but cracks the dam. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting room, where he recovers some of his memory. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, and finds Stryker on a landing pad, where Stryker bargains for his life by offering to reveal Wolverine's past. Wolverine refuses, and binds Stryker in chains. | Storm and Nightcrawler find the students, while Magneto and Mystique kill the rest of Stryker's men. Magneto stops Jason and Xavier from using Cerebro to kill mutants. Disguised as Stryker, Mystique uses Jason to convince Xavier to kill all humans instead; she and Magneto, along with new initiate Pyro, use Stryker's helicopter to escape Alkali Lake, after chaining Stryker to concrete rubble. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control. | The X-Men flee the base as water engulfs it, and discover that Magneto, Mystique, and Pyro have escaped on the helicopter. Iceman and Rogue arrive with the X-Jet and get everyone on board. The dam bursts, flooding the landscape and killing Stryker. A malfunction aboard the X-Jet prevents it from taking off; Jean sacrifices herself and uses a telekinetic wall to shield them from the flood. She activates the X-Jet's primary engines and drops the torrent of water down on herself, which presumably kills her. | The X-Men give the President Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Wolverine tells Cyclops that Jean chose Cyclops over him. As the film ends, Xavier states he believes everything will be alright, while a Phoenix-like shape forms beneath Alkali Lake.","m_cast":"Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier / Professor X | Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine | Ian McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto | Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe / Storm | Famke Janssen as Jean Grey | James Marsden as Scott Summers / Cyclops | Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Raven Darkhölme / Mystique | Brian Cox as Col.

Also in the final scene with Xavier, a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket, as well as a blond haired boy dressed in blue, played by Layke Anderson. These were later confirmed to be Danielle Moonstar and Douglas Ramsey / Cypher.[13] Daniel Cudmore appeared as Piotr \"Peter\" Rasputin / Colossus, introduced in this film as a young mutant with the ability to turn his body into organic steel, and possesses superhuman strength while in that form. Cudmore was set to use a Russian accent, but Singer dropped the idea of accents despite characters of different nationalities.[14] | Jubilee, Psylocke and Multiple Man were to have cameos in the scene where Stryker and his troops storm the X-Mansion. Beast, Gambit and Marrow were to have appearances during a sequence with Cerebro. Gambit's cameo was actually shot, but the footage was not used in the final cut. Beast's scene was to show him in his human form as Dr. Hank McCoy, while his skin morphed into blue fur, and Marrow was to be seen lying on a ground in New York City.[13] Hank McCoy appears on a television during the scene where Mystique drugs Magneto's prison guard. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, the film's writers, cameo in scenes of Wolverine's Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons.[15] Bryan Singer, the film's director, cameos as a security guard in a scene where Professor X and Cyclops go to see Magneto. Shaquille O'Neal wanted a role in the film but was ignored by the filmmakers.[16] | One scene depicts Mystique going through files on Stryker's computer. Singer purposely included various names of characters and hints of storylines from X-Men lore on several computer screens. Singer \"[found] great difficulty in adapting all this stuff into a two and a half hour long movie.\"[7]","m_reception":"X2 opened in North America on May 2, 2003, accumulating $85,558,731 on its opening weekend in 3,749 theaters. The film grossed $214,949,694 in North America, earning $192,761,855 worldwide, for a total of $407,711,549. X2 was a financial success as it recouped its production budget three times.[2] X2 debuted simultaneously in 93 countries, the largest North American and international opening ever at the time.[39] In addition, the film is the sixth highest grossing film based on a Marvel Comic book,[40] and was the sixth highest-grossing film of 2003,[41] also earning $107 million in its first five days of DVD release.[30] | The first cut of X2 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, due to violent shots with Wolverine when Stryker's army storms the X-Mansion. A few seconds were cut to secure a PG-13 rating.[42] | X2 had a video game tie-in, X2: Wolverine's Revenge, which is unrelated to the events of the film, although Patrick Stewart voiced Professor X and Hugh Jackman appears as Wolverine on the cover.[43] The game received mixed reviews.[44][45] X-Men: The Official Game bridges the storyline between X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand. Specifically, it explains Nightcrawler's absence from The Last Stand.[46] Chris Claremont wrote a novelization of the film, which left out its secretive cliffhanger.[47] | The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of critics viewed the film favorably, based on 222 reviews. The sites consensus states: \"Tightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, X2: X-Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor – and a benchmark for comic sequels in general.\"[48] Metacritic calculated an average score of 68/100 from 37 reviews.[49] | Roger Ebert was impressed by how Singer was able to handle so many characters in one film, but felt \"the storyline did not live up to its potential\". In addition, Ebert wrote that the film's closing was perfect for a future installment, giving X2 three out of four stars.[50] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than its predecessor. Turan observed that the film carried emotional themes that are present in the world today and commented that \"the acting was better than usual [for a superhero film]\".[51] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance, concluding \"X2 is a summer firecracker. It's also a tribute to outcasts, teens, gays, minorities, even Dixie Chicks.\"[52] Empire called X2 the best comic book movie of all time in 2006,[53] while Wizard named the film's ending as the 22nd greatest cliffhanger of all time.[54] In May 2007, Rotten Tomatoes listed X2 as the fifth greatest comic book film of all time.[55] | The film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. In addition, Bryan Singer (Direction), Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty (Writing), and John Ottman (Music) all received nominations. It also received nominations for its costumes, makeup, special effects and DVD release, amounting to a total of eight nominations.[56] The Political Film Society honored X2 in the categories of Human Rights and Peace,[57] while the film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form).[58] | Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle was critical of the storyline, special effects and action scenes.[59] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal specifically referred to the film as \"fast-paced, slow-witted\".[60] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote \"Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest\".[61] Richard Corliss of Time argued that Singer depended too much on seriousness and that he did not have enough sensibilities to communicate to an audience.[62]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"After the success of the second film in the franchise, a sequel titled, X-Men: The Last Stand was released in 2006 albeit not directed by Singer.","m_based_on":"X-Men  by Jack Kirby Stan Lee","m_directed_by":"Bryan Singer","m_produced_by":"Lauren Shuler Donner | Ralph Winter","m_screenplay_by":"Michael Dougherty | Dan Harris | David Hayter","m_story_by":"David Hayter | Bryan Singer | Zak Penn","m_starring":"Patrick Stewart | Hugh Jackman | Ian McKellen | Halle Berry | Famke Janssen | James Marsden | Rebecca Romijn-Stamos | Brian Cox | Alan Cumming | Bruce Davison | Anna Paquin","m_music_by":"John Ottman","m_cinematography":"Newton Thomas Sigel","m_edited_by":"Elliot Graham | John Ottman","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"April 24, 2003 (2003-04-24) (London premiere) | May 2, 2003 (2003-05-02) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"133 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$110 million[2]","m_box_office":"$407.7 million[2] | X2 (sometimes promoted as X2: X-Men United,[2][3] or internationally as X-Men 2[4][5]) is a 2003 American superhero film, based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the sequel to 2000's X-Men and the second installment in the X-Men film series. The film was directed by Bryan Singer, written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris, and David Hayter, and features an ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, and Anna Paquin. The plot, inspired by the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, pits the X-Men and their enemies, the Brotherhood, against the genocidal Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox). He leads an assault on Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer Cerebro, in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them. | Development began shortly after X-Men (2000). David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of Beast, Angel, and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines Weapon X and God Loves, Man Kills. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November. Most of the filming took place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film. | X2 was released in the United States on May 2, 2003. It received positive reviews from critics, who mostly praised the storyline and acting of the film. The film received eight nominations at the Saturn Awards and grossed approximately $407 million worldwide. It is the fifth highest-grossing film in the series. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"X2 (12A)\". British Board of Film Classification. April 16, 2003.
