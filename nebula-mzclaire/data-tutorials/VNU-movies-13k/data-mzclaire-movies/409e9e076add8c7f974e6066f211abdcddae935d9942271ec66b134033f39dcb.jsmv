Though given acceptable reviews by most critics, the film was not as successful as Walt Disney had hoped it would be. This may have been due to the anticlimactic ending, where the Union spies are captured, jailed, and attempt to escape. According to a review by the New York Times, \"The excitement is over when they abandon the trains.\"[5] Moreover, some felt the film to be rather depressing or downbeat since the main characters are unsuccessful in their mission and some, including the lead character, wind up being executed.[6]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Francis D.

The film stars Fess Parker as James J. Andrews, the leader of a group of Union soldiers from various Ohio regiments who volunteered to go behind Confederate lines in civilian clothes, steal a Confederate train north of Atlanta, and drive it back to Union lines in Tennessee, tearing up railroad tracks and destroying bridges and telegraph lines along the way. | Written and produced by Lawrence Edward Watkin and directed by Francis D. Lyon, the 85-minute full-color film also features Jeffrey Hunter, John Lupton, Kenneth Tobey, Don Megowan, and Slim Pickens. Paul J. Smith composed the score. Filmed in Georgia and North Carolina, along the now abandoned Tallulah Falls Railway, it was released in U.S. theaters by Buena Vista Distribution Company on June 8, 1956, and capitalized on Parker's growing fame as an actor from his portrayal of Davy Crockett. The film reteamed him with Jeff York (Mike Fink). | Buster Keaton's 1926 feature film The General was based upon the same Civil War incident, though Keaton only loosely based his film on actual events, and made it a comedy, not a drama. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ 'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1956', Variety Weekly, January 2, 1957 | ^ a b Railroad Movies on DVD | ^ Steamlocomotive.com - B&O Railroad Museum | ^ Steamlocomotive.com - Operational 4-4-0s in the United States | ^ New York Times - Screen: Saga of Rails; 'The Great Locomotive Chase' at Mayfair | ^ Bogle, James G & Cohen, Stan.
