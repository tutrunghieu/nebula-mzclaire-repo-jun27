{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"As the film opens, Julie Kohler (Jeanne Moreau) tries to throw herself out of an upstairs window, but is stopped by her mother (Luce Fabiole). Julie is dressed in black and is obviously grief-stricken. In the next scene, she is more composed, telling her mother she is going on a long trip, and counting out five piles of money. She gets onto a train, but right afterwards steps down on the opposite side, hidden from onlookers. | The next time Julie is seen, her hair is different, she is wearing white, and looking for a man called Bliss (Claude Rich). He is a ladies' man who is having a party on the eve of his wedding. When Julie arrives, aloof but attractive, he cannot resist approaching her. When they are alone on the balcony of Bliss's high-rise apartment, she tells him her name and pushes him off the balcony. | Her next victim is Coral (Michel Bouquet), a lonely bachelor. She lures him to a concert and they agree to meet the following night. Before their rendezvous, Julie buys a bottle of arak and injects a syringe of poison into it. When she meets Coral at his apartment, she serves him the drink. When he collapses in agony, she reveals her identity to him. He begs for his life, explaining that it was all an accident. In a flashback, there is a wedding procession on the steps of a church; a single shot rings out and the groom falls to the ground. Julie is the widowed bride. | The next man is Morane (Michel Lonsdale) a would-be politician. She follows his wife and young son home, befriends the boy, and gets the wife to leave by sending a fake telegram that the wife's mother is ill. Julie poses as the boy's teacher Miss Becker, and offers to cook dinner for Morane and his son. Afterwards she plays hide-and-seek with the boy, hiding in an enclosed small closet underneath the stairs, before putting the boy to bed. As she is leaving the house, she pretends that she has lost her ring. Morane helps her search, crawling into the closet where she had hidden earlier. She slams the door and locks him inside. Julie reveals her true identity, and he pleads for his life, saying what happened was an accident. | Another flashback reveals that Julie's husband was killed by a rifle shot fired by Delvaux (Daniel Boulanger), member of an informal hunting club that also included Bliss, Coral, Morane and Fergus. The five men were carelessly horsing around with a loaded rifle in an upper room across the street from the church. After the incident, they went their separate ways, intending never to reveal their involvement in the groom's death. Remorseless, Julie uses duct tape to seal the door of Morane's closet, and he suffocates to death. | Julie waits in Delvaux's junkyard, planning to kill him with a handgun, but he is arrested by the police. Julie moves on to find the fifth member of the hunting group: Fergus (Charles Denner), an artist. Julie models for him as the huntress Diana, eventually shooting him in the back with an arrow. She cuts her face out of his painting to remove the only evidence of her presence. When she discovers that Fergus had painted a mural on his wall depicting her reclining in the nude, she gets some paint to cover the mural's face, but changes her mind and leaves. | Julie attends Fergus' funeral and allows herself to be arrested. She admits that she murdered the four men, but refuses to reveal her motives. | Inside a prison, a meal cart is making its rounds. Julie is a prisoner in the women's wing, and Delvaux is on the men's side. When Julie works in the kitchen, she hides a knife. When the cart makes its rounds with Julie as one of the attendants, it turns a corner out of our sight. After a brief pause, a man's scream is heard.","m_cast":"[3] | Jeanne Moreau as Julie Kohler | Michel Bouquet as Coral | Jean-Claude Brialy as Corey | Charles Denner as Fergus | Claude Rich as Bliss | Michel Lonsdale as Rene Morane | Daniel Boulanger as Delvaux | Serge Rousseau as David | Alexandra Stewart as Mlle Becker | Christophe Bruno as Cookie Morane | Jacques Robiolles as Charlie | Sylvine Delannoy as Mme Morane | Luce Fabiole as Julie's mother | Van Doude as Inspector Fabri | Maurice Garrel as the Plaintiff | Dominique Robier as Sabine","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"La Mariée Était en Noir by William Irish","m_directed_by":"François Truffaut","m_produced_by":"Marcel Berbert Oscar Lewenstein","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jeanne Moreau Michel Bouquet Jean-Claude Brialy Claude Rich Charles Denner Michael Lonsdale Serge Rousseau","m_music_by":"Bernard Herrmann Antonio Vivaldi","m_cinematography":"Raoul Coutard","m_edited_by":"Claudine Bouché","m_production_company":"Les Films du Carrosse Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica","m_distributed_by":"United Artists","m_release_dates":"17 April 1968 (1968-04-17) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"107 minutes","m_country":"France","m_language":"French","m_budget":"$747.000[1]","m_box_office":"$9.6 million[2] | The Bride Wore Black (French: La Mariée était en noir) is a 1968 French film directed by François Truffaut and based on the novel of the same name by William Irish, a pseudonym for Cornell Woolrich.
