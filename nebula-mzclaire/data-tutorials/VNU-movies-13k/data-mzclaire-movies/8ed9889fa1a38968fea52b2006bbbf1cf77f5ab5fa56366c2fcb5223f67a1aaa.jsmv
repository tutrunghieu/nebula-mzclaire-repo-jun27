The film was directed by Stephen Low and narrated by Leonard Nimoy. The film mostly focuses on footage taken at the wreck of the RMS Titanic, also featuring footage of the expedition crew searching the wreck[1] as well as interviews with Titanic survivors Frank John William Goldsmith and Eva Hart.[2] Using Eva and the crew members, Low conveys the voice of the documentary by showing the Titanic's wreckage as a graveyard which is to be respected and treaded with caution and care. It was the second feature length IMAX film released, following Stones at the Max in 1991.[1] An edited 40 minute version of the film was also later released for IMAX theatres in 1995;[3] this version was narrated by Cedric Smith.[4] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e f g Ebert, Roger (14 April 1995). \"Titanica\".
