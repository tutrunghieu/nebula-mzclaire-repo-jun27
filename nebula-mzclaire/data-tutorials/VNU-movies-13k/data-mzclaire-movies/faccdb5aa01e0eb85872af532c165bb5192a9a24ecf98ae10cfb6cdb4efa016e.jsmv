{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) believes that her son, Sam (Christopher Kovaleski), died fourteen months ago in a plane crash, but her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards) tells her that she's delusional and that they have never had a son, and Eliot (Jessica Hecht) doesn't appear to believe in Sam's existence despite her closeness to him. Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise) tells her that Sam was merely a figment of her imagination and is just imagining a life that might have been. He recommends that she be sent to a hospital, but she runs away and meets with a man named Ash (Dominic West) who she thinks is the father of a girl named Lauren (Kathryn Faughnan) who was friends with her son and died in the same crash. At first he dismisses her, claiming he never had a daughter, and calls the police. After she is taken into custody, however, he remembers his daughter and rescues Telly. Together they escape and go into hiding, pursued by National Security agents. | Telly and Ash capture an agent (Lee Tergesen), whom they threaten. The agent reluctantly reveals that he and other agents are merely helping ″them″ and that they do so to protect humankind. Without warning, the roof of the house blows off and the agent, along with the roof, is sucked into the sky—presumably taken by ″them″—and Telly and Ash flee. Eventually, Telly visits Dr. Munce again and he reveals that the disappearances are the work of ″them,″ and that the government monitors their trials, all too aware that they have no power to stop ″them″ from doing whatever they want. | Munce takes Telly to an airport and the dilapidated hangar of Quest Airlines, where he introduces her to an agent of ″them″ (Linus Roache). He tells the agent that it's over and to stop the experiment, because it will only cause more harm. But, the agent replies that it's not over. He reveals to Telly that she has been a part of an experiment to test whether the bonds between mother and child can be diminished. In her case, her memories could not be fully erased. Telly refuses to deny her son's existence. The agent mentions that if he fails to erase her memory then he will look like a failure. The agent then subdues her and convinces her to think of the first memory she had of Sam. Telly thinks of the day he was born in the hospital, which allows the agent to successfully erase Sam's memory from existence. As the agent is walking away, thinking he's succeeded, Telly's motherly bond kicks in deeper, to before Sam was born, when she was pregnant, triggering her memory that she indeed had life in her at one time. All of her memories of Sam return. Before the agent can comprehend what's happening, part of the hangar roof is suddenly blown off, and he's yanked into the sky himself, supposedly for his failure to erase her memory. This ends the experiment. | Telly finds herself living a normal life, although she remembers everything that has happened. She reunites with Sam at a park. Also at the park is Ash, watching over his daughter. Like Sam, he has no memory of what has happened. Telly reintroduces herself, and the two sit and watch the kids play in the playground. | When the film was aired on basic cable the accident was changed, with all mentions of \"plane\" and \"airport\" dubbed to \"bus\" and \"terminal\".[3]","m_cast":"Julianne Moore as Telly Paretta | Dominic West as Ash Correll | Christopher Kovaleski as Sam Paretta Matthew Pleszewicz as Young Sam | Jessica Hecht as Eliot | Gary Sinise as Dr. Jack Munce | Alfre Woodard as Det.
