{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Brendan Byers III (Jerry Lewis) is a rich playboy who enlists to fight in the war against the Axis powers, but is classified 4-F. He really wants to fight, so he enlists other 4-Fs and some loyal volunteers from his own service staff and forms his own army. He finances their training and equipment. Once completed, they travel to the front in Italy, with Byers impersonating a Nazi general named Eric Kesselring. [2] | The plan is to pull back the German lines, since the front has remained static for too long, enabling the Allies to push forward again. The mission does not go smoothly and they must overcome several obstacles, including the fiery wife of the local mayor who is the real Kesselring's lover, and the real Kesselring's involvement in an assassination attempt on Hitler. Afterwards, they face their next mission: infiltrating the Imperial Japanese command to influence the outcome of the Battle of Kwajalein.","m_cast":"Jerry Lewis as Brendan Byers | Jan Murray as Sid | Steve Franken as Bland | Kaye Ballard as Senora Messina | Paul Winchell as Schroeder | Kathleen Freeman as Byers' Mother | Harold J.
