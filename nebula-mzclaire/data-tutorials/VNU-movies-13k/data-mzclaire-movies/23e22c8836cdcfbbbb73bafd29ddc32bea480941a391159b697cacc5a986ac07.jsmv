It was directed by Jack Clayton (his final theatrical film) and produced by Richard Johnson and Peter Nelson, with George Harrison and Denis O'Brien as executive producers. The music score was by Georges Delerue and the cinematography by Peter Hannan. | The screenplay was by Peter Nelson from the novel Judith Hearne by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore. The story presents \"a character study film about a woman's rage against the Church for her wasted life\".[1] Moore wrote the novel after leaving Ireland, in part because of the religious conflict there, and was living in Canada. The book was published in 1955 and was optioned for the stage and screen almost immediately. John Huston optioned it for a film with Katharine Hepburn. Director Irvin Kershner planned on casting Deborah Kerr. Eventually, Jack Clayton, a Catholic himself, was chosen to direct. | The cast also features Wendy Hiller, Marie Kean, Ian McNeice, Alan Devlin, Prunella Scales, Sheila Reid, and Aidan Gillen in his first film appearance. The novel is set in Belfast, but filming took place in Dublin. | BBC Radio 4 produced a radio drama adaptation directed by Michael Quinn in 1995. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Pauline Kael, Hooked p.410 - 411 | ^ Maslin, Janet (23 December 1987). \"Film: 'Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne'\".
