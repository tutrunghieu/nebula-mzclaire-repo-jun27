{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Young Bart Collins (Tommy Rettig) lives with his widowed mother Heloise (Mary Healy). The bane of Bart's existence are the hated piano lessons he endures under the tutelage of the autocratic Dr. Terwilliker (Hans Conried). Bart feels that his mother has fallen under Terwilliker's influence, and gripes to plumber August Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes), without result. While hammering at his lessons, Bart dozes off and enters a musical dream, much as did Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz. | In the dream, Bart is trapped at the surreal Terwilliker Institute, where the piano teacher is a madman dictator who has imprisoned non-piano-playing musicians. He built a piano so large that it requires Bart and 499 other boys (hence, 5,000 fingers) to play it. Bart's mother has become Terwilliker's hypnotized assistant and bride-to-be, and Bart must dodge the Institute's guards as he scrambles to save his mother and himself. He tries to recruit Mr. Zabladowski, who was hired to install the Institute's lavatories ahead of a vital inspection, but only after skepticism and foot-dragging is the plumber convinced to help. The two construct a noise-sucking contraption which ruins the mega-piano's opening concert. The enslaved boys run riot, and the \"atomic\" noise-sucker explodes in spectacular fashion, bringing Bart out from his dream. | The movie ends on a hopeful note for Bart, when Mr. Zabladowski notices Heloise, and offers to drive her to town in his jeep. Bart escapes from the piano, and runs off to play.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"At the Hollywood premiere, patrons walked out after 15 minutes, and box-office receipts were disappointing. At the time it was released, the film received negative reviews from critics. [5] Bosley Crowther called the film \"strange and confused\" and said:[6] | This is one of the most underrated movies of all time and I wish from the very depths of my heart for it to be re-made for modern audiences. \"Dress me Dress me\" remains one of the most poignant songs to ever grace American musical theatre and it is a damn shame that this glorious piece of work was not afforded the respect and admiration it so fiercelydeserves . | Geisel regarded the film as a \"debaculous fiasco\" and omitted mention of it in his official biography.[7] The film may have fared better over the years; it currently has a 79% positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. | In 2002, Peter Bradshaw said the film \"has charm, a riotous imagination, and some very weird dream-like sets by production designer Rudolph Sternad and art director Cary Odell\"; it's \"surreal, disturbing, strong meat for young stomachs.\"[8] In 2005, the Baltimore City Paper called the film \"refreshingly tart and defiant for a children's film, its space-age-by-way-of-Caligari world parks right on the delicious side of creepy. Bring the kids, especially the smart ones.\"[9]","m_production":"In the wake of the success of Gerald McBoing-Boing, Geisel submitted a live-action storyline for The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T in 1951.[1] Geisel followed it up with a 1200-page script, with \"themes of world dominance and oppression coming out of World War II.\"[1] Geisel relocated from La Jolla, California, to Los Angeles during filming to \"enable him to be more involved in the production.\"[1] His influence on set design and choreography is also evident in the film. | Hans Conried was enthusiastic about the role, saying in retrospect, \"I had never had any such part before, never have since and probably never will again. We rehearsed for eight weeks before I was engaged to shoot for eight weeks, an extravagance that I as a bit player had never known ... If it had been a success, with my prominent part in the title role, it would have changed my life.\"[1] | Prior to release, a \"preview version\" was received poorly by a test audience. This prompted heavy cuts from the studio and a week of reshoots included a new opening scene. Of the original 24 musical numbers filmed in their entirety, 11 were removed. The removed songs still survive with the complete musical soundtrack.[2] The \"preview version\" featuring the removed footage is considered lost.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Roy Rowland","m_produced_by":"Stanley Kramer","m_screenplay_by":"Dr. Seuss Allan Scott","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tommy Rettig Mary Healy Hans Conried Peter Lind Hayes","m_music_by":"Frederick Hollander Heinz Roemheld Hans J.
