O. Scott called the film \"A gaudy guilty pleasure that is also a piece of trenchant social criticism\", and said, \"the movie starts out in the mode of reality television, resembling the pilot for a new “Real Housewives” franchise or a reboot of “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.” Before long, though, it takes on the coloration of a Theodore Dreiser novel — not quite an American tragedy but a sprawling, richly detailed study of ambition, desire and the wild swings of fortune that are included in the price of the capitalist ticket.\"[3] | The Economist called it \"an uncomfortably intimate glimpse of a couple’s struggle with a harsh new reality,\" concluding that \"the film’s great achievement is that it invites both compassion and Schadenfreude. What could have been merely a silly send-up manages to be a meditation on marriage and a metaphor for the fragility of fortunes, big and small.\"[4] | Allmovie.com gave the film four stars out of five.[5]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lauren Greenfield","m_produced_by":"Lauren Greenfield Danielle Renfrew Behrens","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jackie Siegel David A.
