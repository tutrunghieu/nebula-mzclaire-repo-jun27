{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins in an unnamed war-torn eastern European city in the 18th century (dubbed \"The Age of Reason\" in an opening caption), where, amid explosions and gunfire from a large Turkish army outside the city gates, a fanciful touring stage production of Baron Munchausen's life and adventures is taking place. Backstage, city official \"The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson\" reinforces the city's commitment to reason (here meaning uniformity) by ordering the execution of a soldier (Sting in a cameo) who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers. | Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the \"real\" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht. | When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe's contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway. | The balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, who has grown younger, finds his old associate Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon (Robin Williams), a giant with separate minds in his head and body, who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon. The death of the King's body, and a bungled escape from the Moon brings the trio back to (and beneath) the Earth, where the Roman God Vulcan hosts his guests with courtesy and Albrecht is found. The Baron and Vulcan's wife, the Goddess Venus (Uma Thurman), attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in the air, but this cuts short the hospitality and Vulcan expels the foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas. | Swallowed by an enormous sea creature from the play earlier, the travellers locate Gustavus, Adolphus, and the Baron's trusty horse Bucephalus. The Baron (who again appears elderly after being \"expelled from a state of bliss\") struggles with the conflicting goals of heroism and a peaceful death, encountering the Angel of Death for the third time. Finally they escape by blowing \"a modicum of snuff\" out into the sea creature's cavernous interior, causing it to sneeze the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole. The Baron, young once again, sails to where the Turkish army is located but the Baron's associates are too elderly and tired to fight the Turk as in the old days. | The Baron lectures them firmly but to no avail, and he storms off intending to surrender to the Turk and to Jackson. His cohorts rally to save the Baron, and through a series of fantastic acts they rout the Turkish army and liberate the city. During the city's celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson and the Angel of Death appears a final time to take the Baron's life. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the Baron is telling to the same theater-goers who were attending the theater in the beginning of the film. The Baron calls the foregoing \"only one of the many occasions on which I met my death\" and closes his tale by saying \"everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after.\" | An ambiguous finale reveals that the city has indeed been saved, even though the events of the battle apparently occurred in a story rather than the film's reality. The Baron rides off on Bucephalus. As the Baron and Bucephalus are bathed in the light of the sun parting the clouds, they apparently disappear, and the credits roll over a triumphant blast of music.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Tall tales based loosely on the German adventurer Hieronymus Karl Friedrich Freiherr von Münchhausen, or Baron Munchausen, were compiled by Rudolf Erich Raspe and published for English readers in 1785 as The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen (or Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels). The tales were further embellished and translated back to German by Gottfried August Bürger in 1786. These tales were frequently extended and translated throughout the 19th century, further fictionalized in the 1901 American novel Mr. Munchausen. | The stories were adapted into various films including Baron Munchausen's Dream (1911, Georges Méliès), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1943, Josef von Báky with script by Erich Kästner), The Fabulous Baron Munchausen (1961, Karel Zeman), and The Very Same Munchhausen (1979) directed by Mark Zakharov, who depicted Munchausen as a tragic character, struggling against the conformity and hypocrisy of the world around him. | The film was over budget; what was originally $23.5 million,[5] grew to a reported $46.63 million.[2] Gilliam, acknowledging he had gone over budget, said its final costs had been nowhere near $40 million.[6] | In The Madness and Misadventures of Munchausen (included on the bonus DVD of the 20th Anniversary Edition of Munchausen), producer Thomas Schühly said that as part of a deal with 20th Century Fox before it ended up with Columbia, a budget plan had been set up for $35 million, \"and it's strange, the [film's] final cost was 35 [million]. [...] We always had a budget of 34 or 35 million, the problem was when I started to discuss it with Columbia, Columbia would not go beyond 25. [...] Everybody knew from the very beginning that this cutting out was just a fake. [...] The problem was that David Puttnam got fired, and all these deals were oral deals. [...] Columbia's new CEO, Dawn Steel, said 'Whatever David Puttnam [has] said before doesn't interest me'\". | Regarding the new regime's apparent animosity towards all of Puttnam's projects and Munchausen, Gilliam added in the same documentary, \"I was trying very hard to convince Dawn Steel that this was not a David Puttnam movie, it was a Terry Gilliam movie.\" Similarly Kent Houston, head of Peerless Camera doing the film's special effects said in Madness and Misadventures that they were promised a bonus if they would finish the effects in time, but when they approached the person again when they were done, he was met with the reply, \"I'm not gonna pay you, because I don't want to seem to be doing anything that could benefit Terry Gilliam.\" | Munchausen is the third entry in Gilliam's \"Trilogy of Imagination\", preceded by Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985).[7] All are about the \"craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible.\"[8] All three films focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination: Time Bandits, through the eyes of a child, Brazil, through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and Munchausen, through the eyes of an elderly man.[8] | When the production finally came to a successful closure, several of the actors commented on the rushed tightness of the whole project. Said Eric Idle, \"Up until Munchausen, I'd always been very smart about Terry Gilliam films. You don't ever be in them. Go and see them by all means - but to be in them, fucking madness!!!\"[9] | Sarah Polley, who was nine years old at the time of filming, described it as a traumatic experience. \"[I]t definitely left me with a few scars ... It was just so dangerous. There were so many explosions going off so close to me, which is traumatic for a kid whether it's dangerous or not. Being in freezing cold water for long periods of time and working endless hours. It was physically grueling and unsafe.\"[10] | Production designer Ferretti afterwards compared Gilliam to his former director, saying, \"Terry is very similar to Fellini in spirit. Fellini is a wilder liar, but that's the only difference! Terry isn't a director so much as a film author. He is open to every single idea and opportunity to make the end result work. Often the best ideas have come out of something not working properly and coming up with a new concept as a result. He is very elastic and that's one quality in a director that I admire the most.\"[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Terry Gilliam","m_produced_by":"Thomas Schühly Ray Cooper Jake Eberts David Tomblin Stratton Leopold","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Neville | Eric Idle | Sarah Polley | Oliver Reed | Uma Thurman | Jonathan Pryce","m_music_by":"Michael Kamen","m_cinematography":"Giuseppe Rotunno","m_edited_by":"Peter Hollywood","m_production_company":"Allied Filmmakers","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"8 December 1988 (1988-12-08) (West Germany) | 10 March 1989 (1989-03-10) (United States) | 17 March 1989 (1989-03-17) (United Kingdom) |  | ","m_running_time":"126 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$46.63 million[2]","m_box_office":"$8 million US[2] | The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a 1988 British adventure fantasy comedy film co-written and directed by Terry Gilliam, starring John Neville, Sarah Polley, Eric Idle, Jonathan Pryce, Oliver Reed, and Uma Thurman. | Based on the tall tales about the 18th-century German nobleman Baron Munchausen and his wartime exploits against the Ottoman Empire, the film received positive reviews from critics, but was a box office bomb. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (PG)\".
