Meanwhile, Roger barters with wealthy and aging business magnate Matt Ord (Robert Middleton) for a plane in exchange for a few hours with his wife. Tragedy ensues when Jiggs' anger about his employer's refusal to face family responsibilities causes him to make a rash and fatal decision. He manages to start Shumann's aircraft, with some difficulty, but the plane crashes and Shumann is killed. After rejecting and then reconciling with Devlin, LaVerne returns to Iowa with son Jack.","m_cast":"Rock Hudson as Burke Devlin | Robert Stack as Roger Shumann | Dorothy Malone as LaVerne Shumann | Jack Carson as Jiggs | Robert Middleton as Matt Ord | Alan Reed as Colonel T.J.
