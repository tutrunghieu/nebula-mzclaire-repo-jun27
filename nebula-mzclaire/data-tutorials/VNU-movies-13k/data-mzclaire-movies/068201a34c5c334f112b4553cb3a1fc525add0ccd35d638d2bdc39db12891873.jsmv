In the 1970s, after the great success of her film, Cabaret, in which she won the Oscar for Best Actress, Minnelli starred in three films - Lucky Lady, A Matter of Time, and New York, New York, all of which failed at the box office. In 1981, she co-starred with Dudley Moore in the hit comedy film Arthur. After that, in 1988, she teamed with Burt Reynolds in the film Rent-a-Cop and again with Moore in the comedy Arthur 2: On the Rocks. Both films were financial flops. There was great anticipation that Stepping Out would re-establish Minnelli's film career. Originally Stepping Out was to be released in the spring of 1991 to coincide with Minnelli's New York concert stage show Live from Radio City Music Hall, but because of a corporate restructuring at Paramount Studios, the film's opening was delayed until October 4, 1991 when it was released only in a very limited format. Despite decent reviews and quite a bit of publicity (Minnelli and the cast of Stepping Out - with the exception of Ellen Greene and Julie Walters - even appeared on the nationally syndicated television talk program The Sally Jessy Raphael Show on the day of the premiere to promote the film), it only grossed $246,000 total in the United States and within a short while, went straight to video.[4] | Variety, in its 1991 review described the film thusly: \"It's Liza-as-you-love-her in Stepping Out, a modest heartwarmer about a bunch of suburban left-feeters getting it together for a charity dance spot. Fragile ensemble item often creaks under the Minnelli glitz, but results are likeable enough.\" Roger Ebert gave the film a moderate review stating \"The [stage play] contained more dancing and was generally more engaging, maybe simply because it was on the stage. As a song-and-dance picture, it talks too much. As a drama, it's superficial and locked into a formula.\"[5]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lewis Gilbert","m_produced_by":"John Dark Lewis Gilbert","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Liza Minnelli | Shelley Winters | Bill Irwin | Ellen Greene | Julie Walters | Robyn Stevan | Jane Krakowski | Sheila McCarthy | Andrea Martin | Carol Woods","m_music_by":"Peter Matz","m_cinematography":"Alan Hume","m_edited_by":"Humphrey Dixon","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 11, 1991 (1991-10-11) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"106 min.","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$246,000[1] | Stepping Out is a 1991 American musical comedy film directed by Lewis Gilbert, written by Richard Harris, based on a play also written by Harris, and starring Liza Minnelli.[2] | Most of the actors are Broadway-level actors and performers, several of whom have won Tony Awards, specifically Minnelli, Krakowski, Martin, Irwin and Greene (nominee).
