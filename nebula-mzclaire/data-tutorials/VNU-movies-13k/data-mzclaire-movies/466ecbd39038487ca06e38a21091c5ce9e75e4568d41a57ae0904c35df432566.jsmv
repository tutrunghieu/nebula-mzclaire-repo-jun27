{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Two hitmen, Max and Al (William Conrad and Charles McGraw), come to a small town to kill Ole \"the Swede\" Andreson[5] (Burt Lancaster). The Swede's coworker at a gas station warns him but, strangely, he makes no attempt to flee, and they kill him in his hotel room. | Life insurance investigator Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) is assigned to find and pay the beneficiary of his policy. Tracking down and interviewing the dead man's friends and associates, Reardon doggedly pieces together his story. Police Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene), a close, longtime friend of the Swede, is particularly helpful. | Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the Swede was a professional boxer whose career was cut short by an injury to his right hand. Rejecting Lubinsky's suggestion to join the police force, the Swede gets mixed up with a bad crowd, including \"Big Jim\" Colfax (Albert Dekker). He drops his girlfriend Lily (Virginia Christine) for the more glamorous Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner). When Lubinsky catches Kitty wearing stolen jewelry, the Swede \"confesses\" to the crime and serves three years in prison. | When the Swede gets out, he, \"Dum Dum\" Clarke (Jack Lambert), and \"Blinky\" Franklin (Jeff Corey) are recruited for a payroll robbery masterminded by Big Jim. Complicating matters is the fact that Kitty is now Big Jim's girl. The robbery nets the gang $250,000. When their rendezvous place burns down, all of the gang members but the Swede are notified of where to meet. Kitty then informs him that he is being double-crossed. The Swede takes all of the money at gunpoint and flees. Kitty meets him later in Atlantic City, then disappears with the money. | Back in the present, Reardon watches the boarding house where Ole lived. Sure enough, Dum Dum shows up, searching for a clue as to the whereabouts of the loot. Reardon gets some information from the robber, but Dum Dum gets away before the police can arrest him. | When Reardon gets confirmation of one particular detail, he is certain he knows what happened. He goes to see Big Jim, now a very successful building contractor. Reardon lies, telling Big Jim that he has enough evidence to convict Kitty. He suggests that Kitty contact him. She agrees to meet him, and they go to a nightclub at her suggestion. However, after she goes to the ladies' room, Max and Al show up and try to kill Reardon. Fortunately, he and Lubinsky are ready for them, and the two hitmen are slain instead. | Reardon and Lubinsky head to Big Jim's mansion, but are too late to stop Dum Dum and Big Jim from killing each other. Reardon explains that when he discovered that the fire that destroyed the rendezvous point had been set hours after Kitty was sent to notify everyone of the new meeting place, he realized that Kitty and Big Jim, her husband, had been setting up the Swede. Dum Dum finally figured out the truth as well. When Lubinsky asks the dying Big Jim why he had the Swede killed, Big Jim tells him he could not take the chance that another member of the gang might find the Swede, as he had. Kitty begs her husband to exonerate her in a deathbed confession, but he dies first.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"When the film was first released, Bosley Crowther gave it a positive review and lauded the acting. He wrote, \"With Robert Siodmak's restrained direction, a new actor, Burt Lancaster, gives a lanky and wistful imitation of a nice guy who's wooed to his ruin. And Ava Gardner is sultry and sardonic as the lady who crosses him up. Edmond O'Brien plays the shrewd investigator in the usual cool and clipped detective style, Sam Levene is very good as a policeman and Albert Dekker makes a thoroughly nasty thug. ... The tempo is slow and metronomic, which makes for less excitement than suspense.\"[10] | In a review of the DVD release, Scott Tobias, while critical of the screenplay, described the drama's noir style, writing, \"Lifted note-for-note from the Hemingway story, the classic opening scene of Siodmak's film sings with the high tension, sharp dialogue, and grim humor that's conspicuously absent from the rest of Anthony Veiller's mediocre screenplay. ... A lean block of muscles and little else, Burt Lancaster stars as the hapless victim, an ex-boxer who was unwittingly roped into the criminal underworld and the even more dangerous gaze of Ava Gardner, a memorably sultry and duplicitous femme fatale. ... [Siodmak] sustains a fatalistic tone with the atmospheric touches that define noir, favoring stark lighting effects that throw his post-war world into shadow.\"[11] | The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100 percent of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 29 reviews.[12] | Wins | Edgar Award: Edgar; from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture, Anthony Veiller (writer), Mark Hellinger (producer), and Robert Siodmak (director); 1947. | Nominations—1947 Academy Awards | Best Director: Robert Siodmak. | Best Film Editing: Arthur Hilton. | Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture: Miklós Rózsa. | Best Adapted Screenplay: Anthony Veiller. | American Film Institute Lists | AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills - Nominated[13] | AFI's 10 Top 10 - Nominated[14]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"\"The Killers\" 1927 short story in Scribners Magazine  by Ernest Hemingway","m_directed_by":"Robert Siodmak","m_produced_by":"Mark Hellinger","m_screenplay_by":"Richard Brooks Anthony Veiller John Huston","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Burt Lancaster Ava Gardner Edmond O'Brien Sam Levene","m_music_by":"Miklós Rózsa","m_cinematography":"Woody Bredell","m_edited_by":"Arthur Hilton","m_production_company":"Mark Hellinger Productions","m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"August 30, 1946 (1946-08-30) (United States) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"103 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$2.5 million (US rentals)[1] | The Killers is a 1946 American film noir directed by Robert Siodmak and based in part on the short story of the same name by Ernest Hemingway.[2] | It stars Burt Lancaster in his film debut, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien, and Sam Levene.[3] The film also features William Conrad in his first credited role, as one of the titular killers.[4] An uncredited John Huston and Richard Brooks co-wrote the screenplay, which was credited to Anthony Veiller. | In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"60 Top Grossers of 1946\", Variety 8 January 1947 p8 | ^ \"The 100 Best Film Noirs of All Time\".
