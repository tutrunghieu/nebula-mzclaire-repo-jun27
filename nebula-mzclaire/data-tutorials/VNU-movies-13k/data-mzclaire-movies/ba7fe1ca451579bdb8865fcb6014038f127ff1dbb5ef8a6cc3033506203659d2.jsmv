{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Helen and Paul Curtis (Carroll Baker and David McCallum) and their daughters Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson) and Ellie (Kyle Richards), move into a manor. Mrs. Aylwood (Bette Davis), the owner of the residence, notices that Jan bears a striking resemblance to her daughter, Karen, who disappeared inside a chapel near the village 30 years previously. | Jan begins to see strange blue lights in the woods, triangles and glowing objects. Eventually, Ellie goes to buy a puppy she names \"Nerak\" (an anagram for Karen). After seeing the reflection of the name \"Nerak\" (Karen spelled backwards), Jan finds out about the mystery of Mrs. Aylwood's missing daughter. | Several strange occurrences appear, beginning with Mrs. Aylwood saving Jan from drowning after she falls into a pond looking at a blue circle, and ending with Jan finding a man named John, who explains that Karen did disappear but has not died. He tells her that in a seance-like ceremony, Karen disappeared after lightning struck the tower and a bell fell on top of her. They find out that the disappearance of Karen is linked to a solar eclipse. Jan figures out she needs to repeat the sequence through the strange possession of Ellie. | In the chapel, something possesses Ellie and explains the accidental switch that took place 30 years ago. Ellie explains that Karen was taken to another dimension, while an alien-like being, the Watcher, came to earth. The Watcher then appears independently as a pillar of light, fueled by the \"circle of friendship\". It engulfs Jan and lifts her into the air, but Jan's friend Mike Fleming (Benedict Taylor) intercedes and pulls her away before the Watcher disappears. At the same time, the eclipse ends and Karen, still the same age as when she disappeared, reappears – still blindfolded. She removes the blindfold as her mother enters the chapel.","m_cast":"Bette Davis as Mrs. Aylwood | Carroll Baker as Helen Curtis | David McCallum as Paul Curtis | Lynn-Holly Johnson as Jan Curtis | Kyle Richards as Ellie Curtis | Ian Bannen as John Keller | Richard Pasco as Tom Colley | Frances Cuka as Mary Fleming | Benedict Taylor as Mike Fleming | Eleanor Summerfield as Mrs. Thayer | Georgina Hale as Young Mrs. Aylwood | Katherine Levy as Karen Aylwood (Replaced by an uncredited actor in the 1981 version)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Watcher in the Woods is based on Florence Engel Randall's 1976 novel A Watcher in the Woods. Producer Tom Leetch pitched the project to Disney executive Ron Miller, stating that \"This could be our Exorcist.\"[1] Brian Clemens adapted the novel into a screenplay. However, Disney decided that Clemens' version was too dark and had Rosemary Anne Sisson revise it. This script was later revised again by Gerry Day in July 1979.[2] During filming, Ron Miller would often intervene to tone down intense scenes, leading to tension between himself and Leetch. Miller recruited John Hough to direct the film after seeing his previous movie, The Legend of Hell House with Roddy McDowall. | When the film was pulled from theatres, several new endings were penned by various writers at Disney to substitute for the original. In addition to the work of studio writers, a number of science fiction writers, including Robert Silverberg, Joe Haldeman, and the Niven/Pournelle team, all working separately, were brought in and paid for alternate endings, but apparently none of those were used. Harrison Ellenshaw, the visual effects designer, later stated that there were \"roughly 152\" possible endings.[3] Ellenshaw wrote the version of the ending that eventually accompanied the re-release of the film. | According to director John Hough during his audio commentary on the 2002 Anchor Bay DVD release, casting the role of the young Mrs. Aylwood was complicated, since the character is featured in two separate time periods; Bette Davis, who was already cast as Mrs. Aylwood, was considered for playing both the young and old versions of the character. | \"You couldn't play a scene with Bette Davis and not really think and not be on your toes, as you just wouldn't have any impact on the scene at all.\" | According to Hough, Davis \"desperately\" wanted to play both parts; so much so, that the production crew had make-up and hair specialists flown in from Los Angeles in order to work on Davis in preparation for screen tests; the goal was to reverse her age appearance by thirty years. After the screen tests were completed and viewed by the crew, Hough was concerned about Davis playing the younger character, and felt that the make-up and hair work had \"maybe knocked about twenty years off of her age, but not forty\";[4] Davis was 72 years old at the time. Upon viewing the tests, Hough cued for the crew to leave the screening room, and said, \"Bette, I don't think you've made it\". After taking one long drag from her cigarette, Davis replied: \"You're goddamn right\".[4] British actress Georgina Hale ended up taking the role of the younger Mrs. Aylwood; according to Hough, she took the part largely because of her admiration for Davis. | In casting the leading part of Jan, Diane Lane had been the initial choice;[5] however, due to complications, the part eventually went to Lynn-Holly Johnson, who had gained attention in the United States as a professional figure skater, as well as for her acting role as a blind ice skater in the 1978 film, Ice Castles, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. | Carroll Baker, who was living in London at the time, was asked to play the part for Hough (who had long admired her work). She accepted the role. Eleven-year-old Kyle Richards - who played Ellie, the youngest sister in the film - had previously worked with Hough on Escape to Witch Mountain in an uncredited role as a younger version of her sister, Kim Richards. | The film was shot primarily at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, and the surrounding areas. The house used in the film was on location; it has since been deconstructed and turned into apartments.[4] Hough used several locations that are also seen in Robert Wise's The Haunting, most notably the grand mansion in which John Keller's character lives; this was the same house used for filming The Haunting (Ettington Park, Warwickshire).","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"A Watcher in the Woods by Florence Engel Randall","m_directed_by":"John Hough","m_produced_by":"Ron Miller","m_screenplay_by":"Brian Clemens Harry Spalding Rosemary Anne Sisson","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Bette Davis Carroll Baker David McCallum Lynn-Holly Johnson Kyle Richards Ian Bannen Richard Pasco","m_music_by":"Stanley Myers","m_cinematography":"Alan Hume","m_edited_by":"Geoffrey Foot","m_production_company":"Walt Disney Productions","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Distribution","m_release_dates":"October 24, 1980 (1980-10-24) (U.S.) | October 7, 1981 (1981-10-07) (edited version) | April 7, 1982 (1982-04-07) (France) |  | ","m_running_time":"84 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$5 million | The Watcher in the Woods is a 1980 American horror film directed by John Hough, and starring Bette Davis, Carroll Baker, Lynn-Holly Johnson, Kyle Richards, and David McCallum.
