It was unfortunate. Jan Sharp, the producer of the film, had the tenacity to get the film made, but she and I had differences of opinion. She was very well informed on the book, and I'm sure her opinions were arguable, as I like to think mine were, but when you have a situation like that, I think the overall project can suffer. I think the film did suffer from that division.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Duigan","m_produced_by":"Jan Sharp","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Karina Lombard Nathaniel Parker Rachel Ward Michael York","m_music_by":"Stewart Copeland","m_cinematography":"Geoff Burton","m_edited_by":"Anne Goursaud Jimmy Sandoval","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"New Line Cinema","m_release_dates":"16 April 1993 (1993-04-16) (US)","m_running_time":"98 minutes","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$1,614,784[1] | Wide Sargasso Sea is a 1993 film adaptation of Jean Rhys's 1966 novel of the same name, directed by John Duigan. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=widesargassosea.htm | ^ Grimes, William (30 November 1992). \"Reviewing the NC-17 Film Rating: Clear Guide or an X by a New Name?\".
