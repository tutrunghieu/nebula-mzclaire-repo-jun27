{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with a quotation from the Book of Job: \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" | A mysterious, wavering light, resembling a flame, flickers in the darkness. Mrs. O'Brien recalls a lesson taught to her that people must choose to follow either the path of grace or the path of nature. In the 1960s or thereabouts, she receives a telegram informing her of the death of her son, R.L., aged nineteen. Mr. O'Brien is notified by telephone while at an airport. The family is thrown into turmoil. | In the present day, the O'Briens' eldest son, Jack, is adrift in his modern life as an architect. One day he apologizes to his father on the phone for something he said about R.L.'s death. In his office, Jack begins reflecting; shots of tall buildings under the sky, Jack wandering in the desert, trees that stretch from the ground up to the sun high in their leaves, and scenes from his 1950s childhood all link together and lead back to the flame are seen. | From the darkness the universe is born, the Milky Way and then the solar system form while voice-overs ask existential questions. On the newly formed Earth, volcanoes erupt and microbes begin to form and replicate. Sea life is born, then plants on land, then dinosaurs.[7] In a symbolic first act of compassion, a dinosaur chooses not to eat a weakened creature that is lying on the side of a river bed. An asteroid tumbles through space and strikes the Earth, causing the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. | In a sprawling suburban neighborhood in the American South live the O'Briens. The young couple is enthralled by their new baby Jack and, later, his two brothers. When Jack reaches adolescence, he is faced with the conflict of accepting the way of grace or nature, as embodied by each of his parents. Mrs. O'Brien is gentle, nurturing, and authoritative, presenting the world to her children as a place of wonder. Mr. O'Brien is strict and authoritarian, and easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. He laments his decision to work in a power plant instead of pursuing his passion for music. He tries to get ahead by filing patents for various inventions. | Jack's perceptions of the world begin to change after one of his boyhood companions drowns at the pool and another is burned in a house fire. He becomes angry at his father for his bullying behavior and begins to keep a running tally of Mr. O'Brien's various hypocrisies and misdeeds, lashing out at his mother for tolerating such abusive behavior. | One summer, Mr. O'Brien takes a long business trip. While he is away, the boys enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating to work in an inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him. | In the present, adult Jack leaves work. Riding the elevator up, he experiences a vision of following a young girl across rocky terrain. Jack tentatively walks through a wooden door frame erected on the rocks and sees a view of the far distant future in which the sun expands into a red giant, engulfing the earth and then shrinking into a feeble white dwarf. Someone says \"follow me\" in the darkness, which is ended by the lighting of two candles. After emerging from rustic doors, Jack follows the girl and then a young version of himself across surreal landscapes. On a sandbar, Jack sees images of death and the dead returning to life. He is reunited with his family and all the people who populate his memory. His father is happy to see him. He encounters his dead brother, whom he brings to his parents. The parents are then seen saying goodbye to the young brother as he steps out of a home into a vast expanse. Accompanied by a woman in white and a young woman, Mrs. O'Brien looks to the sky and whispers, \"I give him to you. I give you my son.\" | Jack's vision ends and he leaves the building smiling. | The mysterious wavering light continues to flicker in the darkness.","m_cast":"Brad Pitt as Mr. O'Brien | Sean Penn as Jack O'Brien Hunter McCracken as young Jack Finnegan Williams as (aged 5) Jack Michael Koeth as (aged 2) Jack | Jessica Chastain as Mrs. O'Brien | Laramie Eppler as R.L.

After being met with both boos[50] and applause[51] at its premiere at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, the film received mixed early reviews.[52][53] The film went on to be awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or. Two of the film's producers, Bill Pohlad and Sarah Green, accepted the prize on behalf of the reclusive Malick.[54] The Tree of Life is the first American film to win the Palme d'Or since Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004.[54] The head of the jury, Robert De Niro, said it was difficult to choose a winner, but The Tree of Life \"ultimately fit the bill\".[54] De Niro explained, \"It had the size, the importance, the intention, whatever you want to call it, that seemed to fit the prize.\"[54][55] | The film won the 2011 FIPRESCI (International Federation of Film Critics) Big Prize for the Best Film Of the Year. The award was presented on September 16, during the opening ceremony of the 59th San Sebastián International Film Festival.[56] Malick released a statement of thanks for the award.[57] On November 28, it was announced that the film had won the Gotham Award for Best Feature, shared with Beginners.[58] | The Tree of Life has since garnered critical acclaim and holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 255 reviews. The site's consensus is that \"Terrence Malick's singularly deliberate style may prove unrewarding for some, but for patient viewers, Tree of Life is an emotional as well as visual treat.\"[59] At Metacritic which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 85 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[60] | Roger Ebert gave the film four stars of four and wrote, \"The Tree of Life is a film of vast ambition and deep humility, attempting no less than to encompass all of existence and view it through the prism of a few infinitesimal lives. The only other film I've seen with this boldness of vision is Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and it lacked Malick's fierce evocation of human feeling. There were once several directors who yearned to make no less than a masterpiece, but now there are only a few. Malick has stayed true to that hope ever since his first feature in 1973.\"[61] The following year, Ebert ranked The Tree of Life one of the 10 greatest films ever made in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll.[62] | The New Yorker said a \"seraphic strain\" in Malick's work \"hits a solipsistic high\" in The Tree of Life. \"While the result will sound to some like a prayer, others may find it increasingly lonely and locked, and may themselves pray for Ben Hecht or Billy Wilder to rise from the dead and attack Malick’s script with a quiver of poisonous wisecracks,\" the magazine's reviewer said.[63] | Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gives it five stars and states it is an \"unashamedly epic reflection on love and loss\" and a \"mad and magnificent film.\"[64] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter states \"Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, including this one, could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place in the grand scheme of things that releases waves of insights amidst its narrative imprecisions.\"[65] Justin Chang of Variety states the film \"represents something extraordinary\" and \"is in many ways his simplest yet most challenging work, a transfixing odyssey through time and memory that melds a young boy's 1950s upbringing with a magisterial rumination on the Earth's origins.\"[66] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone states \"Shot with a poet's eye, Malick's film is a groundbreaker, a personal vision that dares to reach for the stars.\"[67] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film much praise and stated, \"The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming, but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality\". Total Film gave the film a five-star review (denoting 'outstanding'): \"The Tree of Life is beautiful. Ridiculously, rapturously beautiful. You could press 'pause' at any second and hang the frame on your wall.\"[68] Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011.[69] | Some religious reviewers welcomed the spiritual themes of the film.[70][71][72][73] For instance, Catholic author and now auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles Fr. Robert Barron, reviewing The Tree of Life for a Chicago Tribune blog, noted that \"in the play of good and evil, in the tension between nature and grace, God is up to something beautiful, though we are unable to grasp it totally...“Tree of Life” is communicating this same difficult but vital lesson.\"[74] Rabbi David Wolpe says \"that Terrence Malick's new film \"Tree of Life\" opens with a quotation from Job. That quotation holds the key to the film and in some sense, the key to our attitude toward life.\"[75] | On the other hand, Sukhdev Sandhu, chief film critic of The Daily Telegraph describes the movie as \"self-absorbed,\" and \"achingly slow, almost buckling under the weight of its swoony poetry.\"[76] Lee Marshall's review for Screen Daily followed a similar line, seeing the film as \"a cinematic credo about spiritual transcendence which, while often shot through with poetic yearning, preaches too directly to its audience.\"[77] Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline praised the technical aspects of the film, such as the \"gorgeous photography\", however states nonetheless it is \"a gargantuan work of pretension and cleverly concealed self-absorption.\"[78] Filmmaker David Lynch said that, while he liked Malick's previous works, The Tree of Life \"was not his cup of tea\".[79] | Sean Penn has said, \"The screenplay is the most magnificent one that I've ever read but I couldn't find that same emotion on screen. ... A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact.\"[80] He further clarified his reservations about the film by adding, \"But it's a film I recommend, as long as you go in without any preconceived ideas. It's up to each person to find their own personal, emotional or spiritual connection to it. Those that do generally emerge very moved.\"[81] | The film appeared on over 70 critics' year-end top ten lists, including 15 first-place rankings.[82] The Tree of Life was voted best film of 2011 in the annual Sight & Sound critic poll, earning one and a half times as many votes as runner up A Separation.[83] The film also topped the critics poll of best released film of 2011 by Film Comment,[84] and the indieWire annual critics survey for 2011,[85] as well as The Village Voice/LA Weekly Film Poll 2011.[86] | In 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by The Guardian.[87]","m_production":"Terrence Malick pitched the concept of The Tree of Life to River Road Entertainment head Bill Pohlad while the two were collaborating on an early version of Che. Pohlad recalls initially thinking the idea was \"crazy,\" but as the film concept evolved, he came to feel strongly about the idea;[8] he ended up financing the film.[9] Producer Grant Hill was also involved with the film at an early stage.[9] During a meeting on a different subject involving Malick, his producer Sarah Green, Brad Pitt, and Pitt's Plan B Entertainment production partner Dede Gardner, Malick brought up Tree of Life and the difficulties it was having getting made.[10] It was \"much later on\" that the decision was made for Pitt to be part of the cast.[10] | The Tree of Life was announced in late 2005, with Indian production company Percept Picture Company set to finance it and Donald Rosenfeld on board as executive producer. The film was set to be shot partially in India, with pre-production scheduled to begin in January 2006.[11] Colin Farrell and Mel Gibson were at one stage attached to the project. Heath Ledger was set to play the role of Mr. O'Brien, but dropped out (due to recurring sicknesses) a month before his death in early 2008.[12] | In an October 2008 interview Jack Fisk, a longtime Malick collaborator, suggested that the director was attempting something radical.[13] He also implied that details of the film were a close secret.[14] In March 2009, visual effects artist Mike Fink revealed to Empire magazine that he was working on scenes of prehistoric Earth for the film.[15] The similarity of the scenes Fink describes to descriptions of a hugely ambiguous project entitled Q that Malick worked on soon after Days of Heaven has led to speculation that The Tree of Life is a resurrection of that abandoned project.[16] | Principal photography began in Texas in 2008.[17] Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki returned to work with Malick after collaborating with him on The New World. Locations included Smithville, Houston, Matagorda,[18] Bastrop, Austin,[19] Dallas,[20] and Malick's hometown of Waco.[21] | The namesake of the film is a large live oak tree that was excavated from a property a few miles outside Smithville. The 65,000-pound tree and root ball were trucked into Smithville and replanted.[22][23][24] | After nearly thirty years away from Hollywood, famed special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull contributed to the visual effects work on The Tree of Life. Malick, a friend of Trumbull, approached him about the effects work and mentioned that he did not like the look of computer-generated imagery. Trumbull asked Malick, \"Why not do it the old way? The way we did it in 2001?\"[25] | Working with visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, Trumbull used a variety of materials for the creation of the universe sequence. \"We worked with chemicals, paint, fluorescent dyes, smoke, liquids, CO2, flares, spin dishes, fluid dynamics, lighting and high speed photography to see how effective they might be,\" said Trumbull. \"It was a free-wheeling opportunity to explore, something that I have found extraordinarily hard to get in the movie business. Terry didn't have any preconceived ideas of what something should look like. We did things like pour milk through a funnel into a narrow trough and shoot it with a high-speed camera and folded lens, lighting it carefully and using a frame rate that would give the right kind of flow characteristics to look cosmic, galactic, huge and epic.\"[26] The team also included Double Negative in London. Fluid-based effects were developed by Peter and Chris Parks, who had previously worked on similar effects for The Fountain.[27] | A column in The New Yorker noted that the film credited Thomas Wilfred’s lumia composition Opus 161, and that this was the source of the \"shifting flame of red-yellow light\" at the beginning and the end.[28]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Terrence Malick","m_produced_by":"Sarah Green | Bill Pohlad | Brad Pitt | Dede Gardner | Grant Hill","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Brad Pitt | Sean Penn | Jessica Chastain","m_music_by":"Alexandre Desplat","m_cinematography":"Emmanuel Lubezki","m_edited_by":"Hank Corwin | Jay Rabinowitz | Daniel Rezende | Billy Weber | Mark Yoshikawa","m_production_company":"River Road Entertainment Plan B Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","m_release_dates":"May 16, 2011 (2011-05-16) (Cannes) | May 27, 2011 (2011-05-27) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"139 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$32 million[2]","m_box_office":"$54.3 million[3] | The Tree of Life is a 2011 American drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick and starring Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, and Jessica Chastain. The film chronicles the origins and meaning of life by way of a middle-aged man's childhood memories of his family living in 1950s Texas, interspersed with imagery of the origins of the known universe and the inception of life on Earth. | After several years in development and missing 2009 and 2010 release dates, The Tree of Life premiered in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded the Palme d'Or. It ranked no. 1 on review aggregator Metacritic's \"Top Ten List of 2011\",[4] and in January 2012 was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography. | Although early reviews for The Tree of Life were somewhat polarized, many critics and scholars have since declared the film a masterpiece. In the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, 16 critics, including Roger Ebert, voted it one of the ten greatest films of all time; this placed it at #102 in the final list (making it the fourth film on the list which had been released since the year 2000, behind Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love, Edward Yang's Yi Yi, and David Lynch's Mulholland Drive). The film also received five votes in the directors' poll (placing it at #132),[5] and in 2015, the BBC listed it one of the 100 greatest American films ever made.[6] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE TREE OF LIFE (12)\".
