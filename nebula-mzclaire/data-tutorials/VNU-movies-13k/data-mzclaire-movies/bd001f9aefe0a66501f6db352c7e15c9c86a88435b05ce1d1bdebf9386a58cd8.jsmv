{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set mainly in 1913, the film is about Francis Ouimet, the first amateur to win a U.S. Open. Amateur golf in that era was then a sport only for the wealthy, and Ouimet came from an immigrant family that was part of the working class. Ouimet watches an exhibition by legendary British golf pro Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) as a 7-year-old boy, and becomes very interested in golf. He begins as a caddy at The Country Club, a posh enclave located across the street from his home in suburban Brookline, Massachusetts, while making friends with the other caddies. He works on his own golf game at every chance, and gradually accumulates his own set of clubs. Francis practices putting at night in his room. He wins the Massachusetts Schoolboy Championship. | One day, a Club member, Mr. Hastings, asks Ouimet to play with him over The Country Club course, where caddies have almost no access of their own, and he shoots a fine round of 81 despite a 9 on one hole. His talent, composure, and good manners earn admirers and interest. With the help of Mr. Hastings and the Club Caddiemaster, Francis gets a chance to play in an upcoming tournament, the U.S. Amateur, the local qualifying for which is to be held at the very same Country Club course. However, his father Arthur (Elias Koteas) tells his son to quit golf and get a \"real job\". Ouimet needs $50 for the entry fee, and so agrees to get a real job and never play golf again if he could not qualify; his father lends him the money. On the 18th, Francis faces a three-foot putt that would secure him a spot in the championship, but he looks over and his father is watching. Ouimet is distracted, misses and falls one stroke short of qualifying for the championship proper. | With much jeer from the rich folk, Ouimet, now 20, fulfills his promise to his dad and works at a sporting goods shop, while continuing to live at home. After some time with his golf forgotten, Ouimet is still at the bottom of the working class. But one day, the president of the United States Golf Association enters the store and personally invites him to play in the upcoming U.S. Open. After some maneuvering and consideration from his employer, Ouimet secures entry. His father informs Ouimet that he must find his own place to live after the tournament; Ouimet agrees. However, his mother has been supportive of his golf from the start. | Ouimet competes in the 1913 U.S. Open that takes place at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, the familiar course located across the street from his home. Against all odds, with ten-year-old Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter) playing hookey from school to caddy for him, he beats the British champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, then considered the world's best golfers, in an 18-hole playoff, following their three-way tie after the regulation 72 holes, and becomes the first amateur ever to win the U.S. Open. His extraordinary feat even wins over his father.","m_cast":"Shia LaBeouf as Francis Ouimet | Stephen Dillane as Harry Vardon | Josh Flitter as Eddie Lowery | Peter Firth as Lord Northcliffe | Peyton List as Sarah Wallis | Elias Koteas as Arthur Ouimet | Marnie McPhail as Mary Ouimet | Len Cariou as Stedman Comstock | Stephen Marcus as Ted Ray | Max Kasch as Freddie Wallis | Mike 'Nug' Nahrgang as Baritone","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Bill Paxton","m_produced_by":"David Blocker Larry Brezner Mark Frost","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Shia LaBeouf Stephen Dillane Peter Firth Elias Koteas","m_music_by":"Brian Tyler","m_cinematography":"Shane Hurlbut","m_edited_by":"Elliot Graham","m_production_company":"Walt Disney Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 30, 2005 (2005-09-30)","m_running_time":"120 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$25 million[1]","m_box_office":"$15.4 million[1] | The Greatest Game Ever Played is a 2005 biographical sports film based on the early life of golf champion Francis Ouimet.
