M. Rathnam announced that he would finance the production.[7] The production of the film was briefly delayed because Ajith Kumar wanted to spend time with his pregnant wife following the completion of his other film.[8] Anirudh Ravichander was signed to compose the film's music and background score, while Vetri and Ruben were announced as the film's cinematographer and editor respectively. The film developed without a title, before it was confirmed that it would be titled as Vedalam in September 2015.[9] | In late 2014, Hansika Motwani denied reports which had suggested she had also signed on to appear in the film.[10] The producers entered discussions to finalise the cast and crew of the film during early 2015, with Shruti Haasan and Kabir Duhan Singh signed on in March to portray the leading actress and antagonist, respectively.[11] The role of Ajith's sister in the film took considerably longer to finalise, with several actresses approached to portray the character. Actresses Sri Divya, Nithya Menen and Bindu Madhavi all turned down the opportunity, with the latter citing she was only interested in playing the lead actress opposite Ajith.[12][13] After further unsuccessful negotiations with Parvathy Nair, actress Lakshmi Menon was signed on to play the role of Ajith's sister in the film in April 2015.[14] Soori joined the film's cast soon after production began, after replacing Santhanam in the film who became busy with his own productions. Ashwin was also added to the cast to portray a supporting role in late May 2015.[15] | An official launch was held on 9 April 2015, with scenes intermittently shot for the rest of the month.[16] The first official schedule began shoot in Navalur, Chennai with scenes featuring Ajith and Lakshmi Menon entering a college being canned.[17] Subsequent scenes were shot around sets in Chennai throughout June 2015, with Kabir Duhan Singh joining the shoot, while a song resembling a 'pooja bhajan' was shot featuring Ajith, Lakshmi and actor Mayilswamy.[18] The team then moved to Kolkata and scenes were canned featuring Shruti Haasan as a lawyer and Ajith as a taxi driver, with images from the shoot being leaked on social networking sites.[19] The unit then moved to shoot a song sequence in Milan, Italy featuring Ajith and Shruti Haasan.[20] | The team returned to Chennai in August 2015 to film night scenes and action sequences, with actor Rahul Dev joining the team for the shoot, while scenes were also shot at Ramee Mall.[21][22] A final schedule was held at Mohan Studios in Chennai, with Ajith Kumar portraying cropped hair, resembling his look from his earlier film, Red (2002).[23] The team finished production in mid-October 2015 after completing patch-up work on a song. Ajith was injured during the final day of shoot, prompting a minor delay in the shoot.[24] Despite his injury, Ajith began dubbing for the film immediately, in order to ensure that the film would release to coincide with the festival of Diwali in November 2015.[25]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Siva","m_produced_by":"A.
