{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"German Corporal Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) leaves the fighting in the trenches to become an officer and fighter pilot in the German Army Air Service. Joining a squadron in spring 1918, he sets his sights on winning Germany's highest medal for valor, the The Blue Max, for which he must shoot down 20 aircraft. | Of middle class origins, Lieutenant Stachel considers himself better than the aristocratic pilots in his new fighter squadron and sets out to prove it. Meanwhile, Willi von Klugemann (Jeremy Kemp), takes him under his wing. Their commanding officer, Hauptmann Otto Heidemann (Karl Michael Vogler) is an aristocratic officer whose belief in chivalry and the laws and customs of war conflict with Stachel's contempt for them. | On his first mission, Stachel, in a Pfalz D.III, shoots down a British S.E.5, but does not receive credit for his \"kill\" because there were no witnesses. Stachel searches the countryside for the wreckage, giving the impression that he cares more about himself than the combat death of a comrade in arms. | Soon afterward, he attacks an Allied two-man observation aircraft, incapacitating the rear gunner. Instead of downing the defenseless aircraft, he signals the pilot to fly to the German base. As they near the airfield, the wounded rear gunner revives and reaches for his machine gun, unseen by the admiring observers on the ground. Stachel is forced to shoot the aircraft down. Afterward, a disgusted Heidemann believes Stachel has committed a war crime just to gain a confirmed kill. | The incident brings Stachel to the attention of General Count von Klugemann (James Mason), Willi's uncle. When the General comes to the base to award his nephew the Blue Max, he meets Stachel. As Stachel is a commoner, the General sees great propaganda potential in him. Meanwhile, Kaeti (Ursula Andress), the general's wife, is carrying on a discreet affair with her husband's nephew. | Soon afterward, Stachel is shot down after rescuing a red Fokker Dr.I from two British fighters. When he returns to the airfield, he is stunned when he is introduced to the man he saved: Manfred von Richthofen (Carl Schell) -- the Red Baron. Richthofen offers Stachel a place in his squadron, which Stachel declines, explaining his desire to \"prove himself\" with his current squadron. | With Stachel temporarily grounded owing to a minor injury, General von Klugemann orders him to Berlin to help shore up crumbling public morale. Kaeti takes the opportunity to sleep with her latest hero. Upon his return, Stachel taunts an outraged Willi with the news. | Soon after, Stachel and Willi volunteer to escort a reconnaissance aircraft. British fighters attack their Fokker Dr. 1 triplanes. Stachel's guns jam, but Willi downs three Allied planes and the rest disengage. As the two return to their base, Willi challenges Stachel, partly by executing a near-perfect barrel roll to return in formation with Stachel.[3] Spotting a bridge, Willi dives under the wide middle span, but Stachel tops him by flying under a much narrower side one. Seething, Willi does the same, but clips the top of a tower afterward and crashes. When Stachel reports his death, Heidemann assumes that the two verified victories were Willi's. Insulted, Stachel impulsively claims them, even though he only fired 40 bullets before his guns jammed. Outraged, Heidemann reports to Berlin and accuses Stachel of lying. But the Air Service takes Stachel's word for it. Later, alone with Kaeti, Stachel admits he lied. | During a strafing mission covering the retreat of the Imperial German Army, Stachel disobeys orders not to engage enemy fighters. One by one, the rest of the squadron follow him. Afterward, Heidemann confronts him with the fact that half the squadron was killed in the ensuing dogfight. But Stachel cares only that he has shot down enough aircraft, even without Willi's kills, to qualify for the Blue Max. Enraged, Heidemann submits a report recommending court martial proceedings. | The two men are ordered to Berlin. There, von Klugemann tells Heidemann that Stachel is to receive the Blue Max. Explaining that the people need a hero, he orders Heidemann to withdraw his report. Germany is, he says, waging total war against Allied soldiers and civilians and Stachel is the perfect hero for 20th century warfare. Sickened, Heidemann resigns his command and accepts a desk job. | Later that evening, the Countess visits Stachel and suggests that they elope to neutral Switzerland since Allied victory is inevitable. When he declines, she says that she knows Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and can get him a transfer out of harm's way. Kaeti storms out when Stachel refuses to give up combat flying. | The next day, Stachel is awarded the Blue Max by the Crown Prince (Roger Ostime) in a well-publicized ceremony. However, an enraged Field Marshal von Hindenburg telephones von Klugemann and orders him to stop the ceremony. An investigation has been opened into Stachel's false claim. The General asks how the Field Marshal found out. While listening on the phone, he turns to his wife and realizes that Stachel has jilted her. | When Heidemann reports that the new monoplane he has just test-flown is a \"death trap\", with weak struts, von Klugermann sees a way to avoid a scandal that would harm the war effort and destroy his own career. He tells Stachel, \"Let's see some real flying.\" Heidemann is shocked to see the aircraft leaving the tarmac, but is unable to stop it in time. He silently observes the General calmly watching from the office window. After several minutes, the stress of Stachel's aerobatics causes the aircraft to break up and plunge to the ground. Just before it hits the ground and explodes, von Klugemann rubber-stamps and signs Stachel's personnel file and says, \"Give this to the Field Marshal. It is the personal file of a German officer... and a hero.\" | Outside, Captain Heidemann eyes von Klugemann with horror, but then recalls that he is in the presence of a superior officer and salutes. The General and the Countess are driven away in a staff car while the smoke from Stachel's burning aircraft rises in the background.","m_cast":"Cast notes: The casting of George Peppard in the mainly international ensemble cast was considered a \"safe\" choice, as he was establishing a reputation for leading roles in action films. Although youthful looking, at 37 years of age, he was much older than the Stachel depicted in the novel. Peppard wanted to create an \"authentic\" performance and learned to fly, earned a private pilot's license and did some of his own flying in the film,[4] although stunt pilot Derek Pigott was at the controls for the under-the-bridge scene.","m_reception":"Although The Blue Max was seen as a quasi-historical account, some critics decried what they considered an intrusive sub-plot tying a World War I story into the \"modern theme of the corruption of the military-industrial complex.\"[14] Even though the music and the flying scenes were considered the film's redemption, some aviation observers criticized what they thought was a wooden characterisation by Peppard's performance of a dog-fighting combat pilot from military aviation's heroic age.[5] | The Blue Max was a financial success at the box office, earning $5 million in North American rentals in 1966.[15] Director Peter Jackson lists the film as one of the six top World War I movies.[16]","m_production":"The majority of the aircraft used in the film were converted Tiger Moths and Stampe SV.4s. Two Pfalz D.IIIs were produced (by two separate companies) for the film, along with three Fokker D.VIIs and two Fokker Dr.I triplanes. Other German aircraft were represented by repainted Tiger Moths and Stampes. The British aircraft were similarly mocked-up trainers made into British S.E.5s. The German lozenge camouflage was not universal to all units at the time the story takes place (Spring 1918), but, in the film, aircraft of all German units are shown in this scheme. | The Fokker Dr.I triplanes are purpose-built replicas. The Tiger Moth silhouette was more appropriate to British aircraft of the period, such as the S.E.5a (one of which Stachel shoots down during his first mission) and presents a good general impression of actual contemporary aircraft.[5] | The \"death-trap\" monoplane at the end of the film, known as the \"Adler\" (German for eagle) in the novel, may have been inspired by the Fokker E.V, which was a late-war monoplane design which did indeed rapidly gather a reputation for poor construction of the wing, resulting in several crashes before being modified and re-designated the Fokker D.VIII. In the film it is portrayed by Patrick Lindsay's Morane 230 Parasol trainer, with a faired-over front seat to simulate a monoplane fighter visually.[6][7] | The depictions of aerial combat in the film are particularly realistic. The aircraft ground scenes were shot at Weston Aerodrome near Dublin (which should not to be confused with RAF Weston-on-the-Green, England). | Pilots from the Irish Air Corps helped recreate the live dog-fight scenes, supported by number of civilians, including Charles Boddington and Derek Piggott. Piggott was the only pilot willing to fly beneath the spans of a bridge. Taking the role of both German pilots and with multiple takes from contrasting camera angles, he ended up flying 15 times under the wide span of the Carrickabrack Railway Viaduct in Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland, and 17 times under the narrower span. The two Fokker Dr.I triplane replicas had about four feet (1.3 m) of clearance on each side when passing through the narrower span. He was able to fly through the arch reliably by aligning two scaffolding poles, one in the river and one on the far bank. Just before the scenes of flying beneath the bridge, one of the Triplanes executes what could be considered a near-perfect barrel roll as seen from aft of the two Dr.Is used for the scene. Off screen, actor George Peppard flew one of the Pfalz used in the movie.[8] | The director had placed a flock of sheep next to the bridge so that they would scatter as the aircraft approached to show that the stunt was real and not simulated with models. However, by later takes, the sheep had become accustomed to the aircraft, and had to be scared by the shepherd instead. In the printed take, the sheep continued to graze, creating a continuity error which can be seen in the finished film. | The entire collection of aircraft, uniforms and supporting equipment was purchased from 20th Century Fox by ex-Royal Canadian Air Force pilot Lynn Garrison. He kept the collection together in Ireland under his company, Blue Max Aviation, Ltd. Over the following years they played a part in You Can't Win 'Em All, Darling Lili, Zeppelin, Von Richthofen and Brown, and various television commercials, including a classic Ridley Scott production promoting Opel's limited edition \"Blue Max.\" Both of the Pfalz replicas and one Fokker D.VII now belong to New Zealand film director Peter Jackson's 1914–18 Trust, with the Viv Bellamy-designed Pfalz now being on display at the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre in New Zealand. All three aircraft are kept in fully airworthy condition. Another of the Fokker D.VII's is on display at the Southern Museum of Flight in Birmingham Alabama. | The scenes where the Germans come into the French village were filmed on Calary Bog in County Wicklow, Ireland. For many weeks, the building of the village attracted the locals to watch it coming up. Then it was bombed and made to look destroyed. It was a local tourist attraction for a long time after the film had wrapped. | The Berlin scenes were shot in Dublin. Christ Church Cathedral and Leinster House, the seat of the Oireachtas, the Irish national parliament, are easily recognisable in the background of many scenes and Trinity College served as the army headquarters where von Klugermann's office is located. | Many of the flying scenes were shot at Weston Aerodrome (EIWT) near Lucan, Ireland, about 10 miles west of Dublin hence the name confusion with Weston-on-the-Green. Weston Aerodrome is also home to the National Flight Center.[9] There is also a restaurant named after the movie at the Aerodrome.[10] The final scene where Stachel meets his fate was filmed at Baldonnel, the Irish Air Corps' main base. The hangars seen in the movie were built for the Royal Air Force in 1918. | The Carrickabrack Viaduct in Fermoy, Co. Cork was used for the scenes where Stachel and Von Klugermann flew several times under the railway bridge. The view from the 19th century railway bridge which spans the River Blackwater is spectacular and it was one of the reasons the producers of The Blue Max chose it as one of the locations for the film. The railway line linked Mallow, Co.Cork to Waterford City. In 1967 the railway line was closed by CIÉ. | In an article entitled About “The Blue Max” the author, Jack D. Hunter, wrote: | On the day of our arrival at the Bray Studios, we were shown to canvas director’s chairs with our names on the back and treated to rushes of some key action sequences. And I was literally left speechless when I saw Fokker D-7s with inverted engines and 1916-style insignia, Dr-1s with radial engines and smoke canisters on their landing gear struts, machine-guns that looked like Space Cadet props spouting flame without benefit of ammo tracks, every pilot wearing an Uhlan uniform and Battle of Britain style goggles, Gypsy Moths pretending to be Albatros D-3s, a Stampe presented as an RE-8 — the anachronisms and goofs compounded. When I asked Delang about it later, he merely shrugged, rolled his eyes, and sighed resignedly. When I challenged the art director on something so glaring as a D-7 with curve-sided crosses, he shrugged, too. “That kind of cross photographs better,” he said. Ah, but how about those machine-guns with no ammo feed tracks? Another shrug. “No big deal. People just watch the muzzle flashes.” So much for the definitive WWI aviation movie.[11]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Guillermin","m_produced_by":"Christian Ferry","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"George Peppard James Mason Ursula Andress","m_music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith","m_cinematography":"Douglas Slocombe","m_edited_by":"Max Benedict","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"21 June 1966","m_running_time":"156 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$5 million[1]","m_box_office":"$16,151,612[2] | The Blue Max is a 1966 British war film in DeLuxe Color and filmed in CinemaScope, about a German fighter pilot on the Western Front during World War I. It was directed by John Guillermin, stars George Peppard, James Mason and Ursula Andress, and features Karl Michael Vogler and Jeremy Kemp.

Hunter as adapted by Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina. | In contrast to films that romanticize the Flying Aces of the Great War, the protagonist of The Blue Max is depicted as a man with no conscience, no empathy, and no feelings for anyone but himself. The film also explores the decline of chivalry and the advent of total war. Furthermore, in its depiction of a conflict between an amoral officer promoted from the ranks and a principled member of the officer class, The Blue Max is similar to the 1960 film Tunes of Glory.[citation needed]","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Solomon 1989, p. 254. | ^ \"The Blue Max, Box Office Information.\" The Numbers.
