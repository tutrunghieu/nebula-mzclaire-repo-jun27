{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film tells about a Japanese door-to-door insurance salesman, Tsuda Yoshiharu, who takes up boxing after some chance meetings with a former high school friend, Kojima Yakuji. Tsuda lives a more or less uneventful life. He has a fiance, Hizuru, who one day invites Kojima in to Tsuda's apartment. Kojima comes onto Hizuru, who rejects him. Still, Tsuda finds out and gets enraged at Kojima, but Kojima beats Tsuda to a pulp and humiliates him to the point where it strains his relationship with Hizuru. Hizuru is intrigued by the animalistic Kojima, and ends up moving in with him. She also starts to pierce herself and get tattoos. She wants to box, but is denied that life by the surprisingly cowardly Kojima, who says she is a scary freak of a woman. | Tsuda still has feelings for Hizuru, and he keeps trying to win her back, leading to a confrontation where they bond by beating each other's faces to a pulp (Tsuda is quite mutilated in the process). In the end, Kojima and Tsuda end up in a sparring match in their boxing club, which leads to Tsuda getting beaten again, while Kojima goes on to win a real match, with no regard to his own well-being, afterwards. Kojima wins the match, but both he and Tsuda's faces begin to break apart and bleed profusely, suggesting fatal wounds.","m_cast":"Kahori Fujii as Hizuru | Shinya Tsukamoto as Tsuda Yoshiharu | Kôji Tsukamoto as Kojima Takuji | Naomasa Musaka as Hase, trainer | Naoto Takenaka as Ohizumi, trainer | Koichi Wajima as Shirota, gym owner | Tomorowo Taguchi as the Tattoo Master | Nobu Kanaoka as a Nurse","m_reception":"In Japan, Tokyo Fist was placed on some publications best of the year list, including Kinema Junpo.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Shinya Tsukamoto","m_produced_by":"Shinya Tsukamoto[1]","m_screenplay_by":"Shinya Tsukamoto[1]","m_story_by":"Hisashi Saito | Shinya Tsukamoto[1]","m_starring":"Kahori Fujii | Shinya Tsukamoto | Kôji Tsukamoto","m_music_by":"Chu Ishikawa[1]","m_cinematography":"Shinya Tsukamoto[1]","m_edited_by":"Shinya Tsukamoto[1]","m_production_company":"Kaijyu Theater[1]","m_distributed_by":"Kaijyu Theater[1]","m_release_dates":"September 1995 (1995-09) (Turin Film Festival) | October 21, 1995 (1995-10-21) (Japan) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes[1]","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"Japanese | Tokyo Fist (東京フィスト, ＴＯＫＹＯ　ＦＩＳＴ?) is a 1995 Japanese avant-garde and horror film.
