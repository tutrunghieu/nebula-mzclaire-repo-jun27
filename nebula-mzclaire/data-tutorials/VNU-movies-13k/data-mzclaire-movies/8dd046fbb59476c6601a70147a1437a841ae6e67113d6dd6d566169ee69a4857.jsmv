{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1910 London, England, Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter) lives under the careful watch of her domineering Aunt Maude (Charlotte Rampling), who is determined that the young woman does not follow in the path of her recently deceased mother, whose dissolute husband, Lionel (Michael Gambon), Kate's estranged father, squandered her wealth in order to support his opium addiction. Maude wants Kate to marry the well-off Lord Mark (Alex Jennings), who has a title and estates, despite the fact that Kate does not love him. Kate is dependent on her wealthy aunt's goodwill but abandons her plans to defy her aunt when she is reminded that her father is at Maude's mercy as well. Kate's boyfriend, the financially struggling muckraking journalist Merton Densher (Linus Roache), wants to marry her, but is skeptical of Kate's intentions. Despite her pleas for him to wait as she tries to find a way out of her dilemma. | One day, Kate is introduced by Lord Mark to the wealthy and outgoing American orphan and heiress Milly Theale (Alison Elliott), who is on an extended trip through Europe with her best friend Susan Stringham (Elizabeth McGovern), and the cynical Kate is captivated by Milly's beauty, openness, and amusement at the conventions of high society. Milly invites Kate to accompany her and Susan to Venice. Prior to their departure, Milly meets Merton, with whom she is smitten, and she asks him to join them as well. | Lord Mark secretly reveals to Kate that Milly is terminally ill and that he desires Kate but has to marry Milly to avoid losing his estates. Knowing Milly is repulsed by Lord Mark's crudity, she decides to emulate his scheme and persuade Merton to woo Milly. After sending Lord Mark away from London on a ruse, Kate befriends Milly and fully expects Milly's generous nature will lead her to include Merton in her will, making him wealthy enough to satisfy her aunt and allow them to marry. He despises her scheme but can't resist the opportunity to be in Venice with Kate. | During Kate's, Milly's, and Merton's excursions through Venice, Kate gradually becomes so jealous of the genuine affection growing between Merton and Milly that she lures him away one night, abandoning Milly in a crowd. Milly confronts her the next morning and Kate realizes she must leave, without warning Merton, if her scheme is to succeed. What neither she nor Merton anticipate is how things will change when she is gone. After Kate leaves Venice to return to England, Merton hears about it and confesses everything to Milly about Kate's scheme and of his involvement in it, which Milly takes it very calmly and gracefully. A few days later, Milly dies and both Merton and Susan attend her funeral. | A few weeks later, Kate comes to Merton's flat. She asks why he has not come to see her and finds a letter from Milly's attorneys, telling Merton that Milly did indeed bequeath a sizable portion of her estate to him. He tells Kate that he will not take the money, and she must marry him without it, if she will. She agrees, and they make love. But afterwards, Kate asks him to tell her that he is not still in love with Milly, or his memory of her, and he cannot. So, Merton returns to Venice, alone.","m_cast":"Helena Bonham Carter as Kate Croy | Linus Roache as Merton Densher | Alison Elliott as Milly Theale | Elizabeth McGovern as Susan Stringham | Charlotte Rampling as Aunt Maude | Michael Gambon as Lionel Croy | Alex Jennings as Lord Mark","m_reception":null,"m_production":"London exterior locations include Brompton Cemetery in Fulham Road; Carlton House Terrace in St. James's; Freemasons' Hall in Great Queen Street; Kensington Gardens; the National Liberal Club in Whitehall; the Richmond Fellowship; and the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich.
