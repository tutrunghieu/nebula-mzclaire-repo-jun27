His Rolls Royce splashes her dress with mud while she is on her way to a job interview. | Philip wants an affair, while Cathy is holding out for marriage. Watching from the sidelines are Philip's financial manager, Roger, who sees a therapist because he feels guilty about helping his boss with his numerous conquests, and Cathy's roommate, Connie Emerson, who knows what Philip is after. | Philip wines and dines Cathy. He takes her to see the New York Yankees play. They watch from the Yankees dugout (he owns part of the team). Cathy's complaints about the umpire while seated alongside Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Yogi Berra (playing themselves), cause Art Passarella to throw all of them out of the game. | Philip's conscience weighs on him, so he withdraws an invitation to Bermuda, which only serves to make Cathy agree to go. While in Bermuda, Cathy comes down with a nervous rash, much to her embarrassment and his frustration. | The Bermuda trip is repeated, but this time Cathy drinks to soothe her nerves and ends up drunk. While intoxicated, Cathy falls off the balcony onto an awning below. She is then carried in her pajamas through the crowded hotel lobby. | At the urging of Roger and Connie who are convinced that Philip is in love with her, Cathy goes on a date with Beasley, whom she dislikes, to make Philip jealous. Her plan succeeds and she and Philip get married. On their honeymoon, he breaks out in a rash.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film grossed $17,648,927 at the box office,[1] earning $8.5 million in US theatrical rentals.[2] It was the 4th highest grossing film of 1962. | Nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Art Direction (Alexander Golitzen, Robert Clatworthy, George Milo), Best Sound (Waldon O.

However, he was a completely private person, totally reserved, and very distant. Their relationship on this film was amicable but totally devoid of give-and-take. | When Roger (Gig Young) is showing Cathy (Doris Day) the list of potential husbands for her, we learn that one of the names on the list is Rock Hudson, Day's co-star in Pillow Talk, Lover Come Back, and Send Me No Flowers. In fact, Rock Hudson had expected to be cast as Philip, but director Delbert Mann wanted Cary Grant. Grant hated the finished film.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Delbert Mann","m_produced_by":"Robert Arthur Martin Melcher Stanley Shapiro","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Doris Day Cary Grant","m_music_by":"George Duning","m_cinematography":"Russell Metty","m_edited_by":"Ted J.
