{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in 1935, the movie tells the story of a 15-year-old tomboy girl, Natty Gann (Meredith Salenger). Out of work because of Depression-era unemployment, Natty's widowered father (Ray Wise) parlays his surefootedness into getting a job as a lumberjack. In order to get hired, he travels from Chicago to the state of Washington. He tells Natty that she will have to look after herself for the time being. Having no mother, Natty is left in the care of Connie (Lainie Kazan), the insensitive woman who manages the hotel Natty and her father had been living in. | After overhearing Connie reporting her as an abandoned child, Natty runs away to find her father on her own, embarking on a cross-country journey. Along the way she saves a wolfdog from a dog fighting ring. In return the dog, whom she calls Wolf, follows her as her protector in her attempt to return to her Father. She has a brief, innocent romance with another young traveler (John Cusack), and encounters various obstacles that test her courage, perseverance, and ingenuity, such as being falsely accused of cattle rustling and remanded to a juvenile facility. Natty escapes the detention center and is aided by a mountain man, who spirits her out of the area and gives her some money. | Connie tells Natty's father on the phone that she ran away, causing him to worry. He becomes grief-stricken when he learns that Natty's wallet was found underneath a derailed train - unbeknownst to him, she lived through the crash when she stowed away on it during part of her journey. He leaves the lumber company to search through the wreckage for her, to no avail. He returns to the lumber camp and accepts the most dangerous jobs, known as \"widow's work\" on the basis that his daughter has died and he should throw himself into his work. | Locating her father's company's base-camp, Natty eventually finds and reunites with her father in a heartwarming embrace on a mountain road. Afterwards, she lets Wolf go to answer the call of the other wolves that are free.","m_cast":"Meredith Salenger as Natty Gann | John Cusack as Harry | Ray Wise as Sol Gann | Lainie Kazan as Connie | Scatman Crothers as Sherman | Verna Bloom as Farm Woman | John P.
