{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and the rest of the Muppets have graduated from Danhurst College by entertaining their fellow graduates with their theatrical production of Manhattan Melodies. Upon the suggestion of taking the show to Broadway, the Muppets proceed with the idea, certain they will become stars instantly. Arriving in Manhattan, the group meet producer Martin Price but soon discover he is a con artist named Murray Plotsky upon the arrival of the police. Plotsky is arrested, leaving the Muppets' hopes dashed. They try other theatrical producers but without success, their morale and finances taking a nosedive. | Thinking they are becoming a burden to Kermit when he snaps at them, the rest of the Muppets agree to go their separate ways and get new occupations, though Miss Piggy secretly remains in Manhattan to keep an eye on Kermit. Though disappointed by the development, Kermit vows to make the show a hit and enlists the help of diner owner Pete, his daughter Jenny who is an aspiring fashion designer, and the diner's staff of rats led by Rizzo. Attempting to promote the show, Kermit first poses as an eccentric producer bragging about the musical's quality but the producer he meets discards the script after Kermit makes his exit. Kermit then poses as a famous playwright, having the rats insert a caricature picture at Sardi's restaurant by replacing it with Liza Minnelli's picture. When Liza Minnelli comes in and notices it missing, she asks Vincent Sardi Jr. if she did something wrong to get it removed. When the rats are exposed, Vincent Sardi Jr. finds Liza's picture near Kermit. This causes Kermit to get thrown out of the restaurant. | While in Central Park, Jenny comforts Kermit about his losses, while an envious Miss Piggy observes. When a thief steals her purse, Miss Piggy borrows a pair of rollerskates and furiously gives chase until she captures him, but reunites with Kermit in the process and they make up. Piggy takes a job at Pete's diner while Kermit receives several letters from his friends who have taken up numerous jobs around the United States. He then receives a letter from producer Bernard Crawford who is interested in the musical. However, the letter was actually sent by Ronnie Crawford, his son, who likes Manhattan Melodies; himself trying to make a name as a producer. Bernard himself is sceptical but agrees to fund the show. A thrilled Kermit heads back to the diner but is so happy that he walks into oncoming traffic and is immobilized when he gets hit by a passing motorcar. | The rest of the Muppets are summoned back to New York, but learn that Kermit has disappeared. At the hospital, Kermit's doctor learns that he has lost memory of his life. He makes his way to Madison Avenue, where he finds a trio of frogs who work in advertising, and offer him a job when he comes up with a slogan and thinks of himself as \"Phil\". The rest of the Muppets search for Kermit where one attempt had Gonzo trying to get Mayor Edward I. Koch to help. | Bill, Gill, Jill, and Kermit end up visiting Pete's diner where Kermit's friends recognize him when he plays the show's opening number with spoons. At the Biltmore Theatre on opening night, the Muppets try to help Kermit remember, but it only works when Miss Piggy punches him for insulting their past romance. Kermit regains his memories and, realizing the show needs more Muppets, asks the Madison Avenue frogs, the dogs, the bears, the chickens, and others to become supernumeracies. | The show is a success, culminating in what is intended to be a staged wedding between Kermit and Miss Piggy's characters, only for a real minister to appear (instead of Gonzo as Kermit planned). With all of the Muppets, the characters from Sesame Street, and Uncle Traveling Matt from Fraggle Rock present, Kermit and Miss Piggy get married as the film ends.","m_cast":"Louis Zorich as Pete, the owner and chef of Pete's Diner. | Juliana Donald as Jenny, Pete's daughter who works as a waitress and aspiring fashion designer. | Lonny Price as Ronnie Crawford | Cheryl McFadden as Nancy, the secretary to Martin Price. | Graham Brown as Mr. Wrightson | Jim Henson as Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Teeth, The Swedish Chef, The Muppet Newsman, Waldorf, Baby Kermit, Baby Rowlf, Ernie | Frank Oz as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, Sam Eagle, Baby Piggy, Baby Fozzie, Bert, Cookie Monster | Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Crazy Harry, Camilla the Chicken, Pops, Lew Zealand, Bear | Richard Hunt as Scooter, Janice, Statler, Baby Scooter, Beaker (scenes deleted), Bear | Dave Goelz as The Great Gonzo, Chester the Rat, Bill the Frog, Zoot, Penguin, Jim the Dog, Baby Gonzo, Beauregard (scenes deleted), Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (scenes deleted) | Steve Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat, Gill the Frog, Bear | Bruce Edward Hall as Masterson the Rat, Beth Bear | Kathryn Mullen as Jill the Frog | Karen Prell as Yolanda the Rat, Frank the Dog | Brian Muehl as Tattooey the Rat | Martin P.

Having directed The Great Muppet Caper and The Dark Crystal back-to-back, Henson decided to serve as the producer along with David Lazer. Upon selecting fellow Muppet performer and Dark Crystal co-director Frank Oz to handle directorial duties, Henson stated, \"I was looking at the year ahead and I thought my life was very busy and I thought maybe it was a time to have Frank directing one of these.\"[4] Shortly after, Oz confirmed his involvement to the project. The first draft titled The Muppets: The Legend Continues, written by Muppet Caper scribes Jay Tarses and Tom Patchett, was dismissed by Oz for being \"way too over jokey\".[4] After being given Henson's encouragement to tinker with the script, Oz revised the screenplay in an effort to develop the \"oomph of the characters and their relationships\".[4] Once the script was completed and the sets were built, special consultant David Misch was brought in to write cameos for some guest star appearances. Originally, this list of guest stars contained the likes of Dustin Hoffman, Steve Martin, Michael Jackson, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, and Laurence Olivier to name a few. According to Misch, Hoffman was going to play a Broadway producer and planned to do an imitation of legendary film producer Robert Evans (The Godfather), which he later did in the film Wag the Dog. However, at the last minute, Hoffman decided that the role could be offensive to Evans and dropped out, following which all the other big names dropped out as well. Because of the dropped cameos, Misch and director Oz ended up rewriting most of the film's dialogue.[5] Although the wedding scene was only used that have Ernie, Bert and Cookie Monster have speaking roles.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Frank Oz","m_produced_by":"David Lazer","m_screenplay_by":"Tom Patchett Jay Tarses Frank Oz","m_story_by":"Tom Patchett Jay Tarses","m_starring":"Jim Henson | Frank Oz | Dave Goelz | Steve Whitmire | Richard Hunt | Jerry Nelson","m_music_by":"Ralph Burns (score) Jeff Moss (songs)","m_cinematography":"Robert Paynter","m_edited_by":"Evan A.
