The music was written by John Scott and, like the last colour season of the previous ITC production, incorporated Leslie Charteris own theme, which had previously been used in films and on radio. For the French version, Scott's music was replaced with a theme incorporating vocals (as had happened to previous Saint composer Edwin Astley with Danger Man), but Charteris' eight-note theme remained. | Jaguar seized promotional opportunities with Return of the Saint. A decade and a half before, Jaguar had turned down the producers of the earlier Saint series when approached about the E-type; the producers had instead used a Volvo P1800. In Return of the Saint Simon Templar drives an early XJ-S with the number plate \"ST 1\". Miniature versions were made by Corgi and proved popular. | According to Burl Barer in his history of The Saint, the series was originally conceived as Son of the Saint, with Ogilvy's character identified as the offspring of Simon Templar. As production neared, it was decided to drop the relative angle and make the series about the original character, albeit updated to the late 1970s. | Unlike the earlier series, Return of the Saint did not adapt any Leslie Charteris stories; however, several teleplays (such as \"The Imprudent Professor\" and \"Collision Course\") were adapted as novels that were credited to Charteris but written by others. A number of Saint books were reprinted with covers depicting Ogilvy as Templar as a tie-in with the series; these collectable volumes carried the Return of the Saint title. The adaptation of \"Collision Course\", retitled Salvage for the Saint was published in 1983 (several years after the series ended) and was the 50th and final Saint book to be published in a series of publications dating back to the 1920s. The two episodes of \"Collision Course\" were also edited together to form the syndicated TV-movie, The Saint and the Brave Goose.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":null,"m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"24","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":"The Saint | Return of the Saint was a British action-adventure television series that aired for one season in 1978 and 1979 in Britain on ITV, and was also broadcast on CBS in the United States.
