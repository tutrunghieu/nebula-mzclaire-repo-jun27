Teddy is happily married to Didi, but he cannot get this woman out of his mind. | Encouraged by his friends Buddy, Joe and Michael, he tries to ask her for a date but mistakenly phones Ms. Milner, a plain ad-agency employee who is flattered by his interest. | Teddy ultimately does become acquainted with the woman in red, a model named Charlotte, going horseback riding with her and even inviting her to a relative's party. He radically alters his wardrobe and begins using elaborate ruses to see Charlotte socially. Meanwhile, he incurs the wrath of Ms. Milner, whom he stands up. | Events come to a head in Charlotte's high-rise apartment, where she invites Teddy into her bed. He is thrilled until her airline pilot husband suddenly comes home. Teddy ends up on a ledge, where passersby below believe he is about to commit suicide, all captured on live television.","m_cast":"Gene Wilder as Theodore Pierce | Kelly Le Brock as Charlotte | Gilda Radner as Ms. Milner | Charles Grodin as Buddy | Joseph Bologna as Joe | Judith Ivey as Didi Pierce | Michael Zorek as Shelly | Michael Huddleston as Michael | Arthur Bailey as Jocko | Kyra Stempel as Missy Pierce | Robin Ignico as Becky Pierce | Viola Kates Stimpson as Mama Dell","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Gene Wilder","m_produced_by":"Victor Drai","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Gene Wilder | Charles Grodin | Joseph Bologna | Judith Ivey | Michael Huddleston | Kelly Le Brock | Gilda Radner","m_music_by":"John Morris Stevie Wonder","m_cinematography":"Fred Schuler","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures","m_release_dates":"August 15, 1984 (1984-08-15) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$25,308,147 (USA) | The Woman in Red is a 1984 romantic comedy film starring and directed by Gene Wilder, who wrote the script, adapting it from the Yves Robert film Pardon Mon Affaire. | It co-stars Charles Grodin, Gilda Radner, Joseph Bologna, Judith Ivey and Kelly Le Brock, and won an Academy Award for best original song, \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\", performed by Stevie Wonder. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Woman in Red at the Internet Movie Database | The Woman in Red at AllMovie | The Woman in Red at Rotten Tomatoes | The Woman in Red at Box Office Mojo","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Womaninredposter.jpg/220px-Womaninredposter.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Yves Robert (play) Jean-Loup Dabadie (play) Gene Wilder"}
