{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) is a special forces agent and black ops soldier. Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), head of the covert government agency for which Simmons works, assigns him to infiltrate a biochemical weapons plant in North Korea. Unknown to Simmons, Wynn has ordered his top assassin, Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke), to murder him while he is on his mission. After Simmons dies, he is set on fire by Wynn and the flames cause the plant to explode. Simmons arrives in Hell, where one of the rulers of Hell - Malebolgia (Frank Welker) - offers him a Faustian deal: if Simmons becomes his eternal servant and leader of his army in Armageddon, he will be able to return to Earth to see his fiancée, Wanda Blake. Simmons accepts the offer and returns to Earth. | Upon his return, Simmons learns that five years have passed since his death. Wanda is now married to his best friend, Terry Fitzgerald (D.B. Sweeney), who is living as the father to his daughter, Cyan. Soon Simmons encounters a clown-like demon named Violator (John Leguizamo), sent by Malebolgia, who acts as Simmons's guide down the path to evil. He also meets a mysterious old man named Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson), a fellow Hellspawn who has successfully freed his soul and now fights for Heaven. Simmons learns that Wynn, now a high-end weapons dealer, has developed what he calls the ultimate biological weapon, Heat 16. During a reception, Simmons, as Spawn, attacks Wynn, kills Jessica, and escapes with the help of his necroplasm armor. | Following the attack by Simmons, Violator convinces Wynn to have a device attached to his heart that will trigger the worldwide release of Heat 16 should his vital signs flatline, under the guise of it being a safeguard against assassination attempts. However, Malebolgia actually wants Simmons to kill Wynn and initiate the apocalypse. Spawn confronts Violator, who turns into his demonic form and beats him down. Cogliostro rescues him and teaches him how to use his necroplasm armor. Simmons learns that Violator and Wynn are going to kill Terry, Cyan, and Wanda. | Terry sends an email with the evidence to expose Wynn to a fellow newsman. Just as the email is sent, Cyan enters the room, with Wynn right behind her. Wynn destroys Terry's computer and takes the family hostage. When Spawn arrives, he nearly kills Wynn, despite being warned that Wynn's death will launch the Heat 16 bombs. After realizing that Wynn's death would also mean the death of Cyan, Spawn extracts the device from Wynn's body and destroys it. His plans foiled, Violator draws Spawn and Cogliostro into Hell, where they both battle the demon before subduing him. Spawn is then confronted by Malebolgia, and tells him that he will never lead Hell's army. Spawn escapes with Cogliostro just before they are overwhelmed by Malebolgia's forces. Violator, having recovered, follows them. A final battle ensues, ending with Spawn decapitating the demon with his chains. Violator's head taunts the group and threatens his return before melting and returning to Hell. Wynn is arrested, and Spawn, realizing there is no place for him in Wanda's world anymore, dedicates himself to justice rather than succumbing to his lust for vengeance.","m_cast":"Michael Jai White as Al Simmons/Spawn | John Leguizamo as Clown/Violator | Martin Sheen as Jason Wynn | Nicol Williamson as Cogliostro | Theresa Randle as Wanda Blake Simmons-Fitzgerald | D.

Negotiations eventually fell through as Todd McFarlane felt the studio was not giving him enough creative control.[4] McFarlane eventually sold the film rights to New Line Cinema for $1 in exchange for creative input and merchandising rights.[5] New Line president Michael DeLuca, a comic book collector himself, expressed interest in having \"a character that has as established an audience as Spawn\", while declaring that success hinged on an adaptation that \"maintains a PG-13 rating but retains its darkness.\"[4] | As visual effects were the main concern of production, the film was to be produced by Pull Down Your Pants Pictures, a company formed by three former Industrial Light & Magic artists: Mark A.Z. Dippé, Clint Goldman and Steve 'Spaz' Williams. Dippé was slated to direct the film, with Goldman as producer, and Williams as second unit director and visual effects supervisor.[6] Dippé and Williams, who at the time was the only one of the three still attached to ILM, have called the film opportunity \"our ticket out of the company\".[7] The script would be written by Alan B. McElroy, who, along with writing the Spawn comic book, also wrote many episodes of the Todd McFarlane's Spawn animated series.[6] | Michael Jai White found Al Simmons' character appealing; he described Spawn as \"the most tragic character I've encountered in any cinematic production.\" He says it was a challenge to make audiences sympathize with a government assassin who comes back from hell. White had endure two to four hours of make-up work, including a full glued-on bodysuit, yellow contact lenses that irritated his eyes, and a mask that restricted his breathing.[8] He said that his long-time experience with martial arts helped him endure the uncomfortable prosthetics, giving him \"strong will and unbreakable concentration.\"[4] | Spawn was originally green-lit with a budget of $20 million. The scale of the visual effects led New Line to continually increase the project budget, which grew to $40 million—a third of which was spent on the effects. The shooting schedule was only 63 days. To cut production times by a week, Goldman lent $1 million to engage John Grower's Santa Barbara Studios to develop the digitally produced Hell sequences.[5] The visual effects shot count increased from 77 to over 400, created by 22 companies in the United States, Canada and Japan,[9] requiring 70 people and nearly 11 months to complete. ILM did most of the work, creating 85 shots at a cost of $8.5 million. The most difficult sequences in the film to render included the Violator, Spawn's digital cape, and some of Spawn's transformations.[5][10] More than half of the final effects shots were delivered two weeks before the film's debut.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Spawn  by Todd McFarlane","m_directed_by":"Mark A.Z.

The film co-stars John Leguizamo (as Clown/The Violator, Al's demonic guide and the film's antagonist) and Nicol Williamson (as Al's mentor, Cogliostro).
