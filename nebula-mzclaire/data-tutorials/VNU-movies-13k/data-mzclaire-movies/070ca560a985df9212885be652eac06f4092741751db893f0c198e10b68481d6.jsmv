{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"17-year-old Andy[9] is about to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take only Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie and the other toys in a bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy intended to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Barbie bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them but is unable to convince them of the mistake. | Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour of the seemingly idyllic play-setting by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (\"Lotso\"), Big Baby, and Ken, with whom Barbie falls in love. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She takes Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play roughly with Andy's toys, unlike the gentler older children. | Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have them moved to the older children's room, but Lotso, who controls Sunnyside in a concentration camp-like style, refuses, explaining that the newer toys need to be sacrificed to the younger children to protect the older ones, who want to avoid enduring such damage and suffering. Seeing promise in Buzz, he resets him to his original space ranger persona, which also resets his memory. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she accidentally left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys and realizes Woody was telling the truth. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz. | At Bonnie's house, a toy clown named Chuckles explains to Woody that he, Lotso and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, they made their way back to her house, only to find that Lotso had been replaced, causing Lotso to become resentful. | Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy that there is only one way out of the daycare: the trash. He reconciles with Andy's other toys and begins planning a way out of Sunnyside. That night, the toys execute their escape, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are caught by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and tosses Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso smashes the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but this leads an enraged Big Baby to throw Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to run away, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. | The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver who straps him to his truck's radiator grill and drives away. Woody and his friends board another garbage truck back to Andy's house. | In Andy's room, Woody climbs into the box with Andy's college supplies, while the other toys ready themselves for the attic. Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes the toys to Bonnie's house and introduces her to them. Bonnie recognizes Woody, who, to Andy's surprise, is at the bottom of the box. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and then plays with her before leaving. Woody and the other toys watch Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie. Meanwhile, Barbie, Ken and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside, and maintain contact with Woody and his friends through letters.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Toy Story 3 earned $415,004,880 in North America, and $648,167,031 in other countries, totaling $1,063,171,911 worldwide, earning more revenue than the previous two films of the series combined.[1] It became the highest-grossing animated film, surpassing the six-year-old record held by Shrek 2 ($919 million),[64] until Walt Disney Animation Studios' Frozen surpassed it in 2014 followed by Minions in 2015.[65] It is the eighteenth highest-grossing film,[66] the highest-grossing 2010 film,[67] the third highest-grossing animated film (behind Frozen and Minions),[7] the highest-grossing film in the Toy Story series,[68] the highest-grossing Pixar film,[69] and the seventh highest-grossing film distributed by Disney.[70] In estimated attendance, though, it still ranks fourth on the list of modern animated films, behind Shrek 2, Finding Nemo and The Lion King.[7] On its first weekend, Toy Story 3 topped the worldwide box office with $145.3 million ($153.7 million with weekday previews), the third-largest opening weekend worldwide for an animated feature.[71] On August 27, 2010, its 73rd day of release, it surpassed the $1 billion mark, becoming the third Disney film, the second Disney-distributed film in 2010 (after Alice in Wonderland), the first animated film[7] and the seventh film in cinematic history to do so. | In North America, Toy Story 3 is the sixteenth highest-grossing film, unadjusted for inflation. Adjusted for ticket price inflation though, it ranks 90th on the all-time chart.[72] It is also the highest-grossing 2010 film,[73] the highest-grossing Pixar film,[69] the second-highest-grossing G-rated film,[74] the third-highest-grossing animated film,[75] and the sixth-highest-grossing film distributed by Disney.[76] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 52 million tickets in the US.[77] The film earned $41,148,961 on its opening day (Friday, June 18, 2010) from 4,028 theaters, including $4 million at midnight shows from about 1,500 theaters, setting an opening-day record for an animated film.[78] | During its opening weekend, the film topped the box office with $110,307,189, setting an opening-weekend record among Pixar films,[79] among films released in June,[80] (surpassed by Man of Steel)[81] and among G-rated films.[82] The film also achieved the second-largest opening weekend for an animated film,[83] and the fourth-largest opening weekend for a 2010 film.[84] Its average of $27,385 per venue is the second highest for a G-rated film and the second highest for an animated feature.[85] Its opening-week gross (Friday-through-Thursday) of $167.6 million is the largest among animated films, the largest among 2010 films and the 13th largest of all time.[86] It also achieved the largest 10-day gross among 2010 films.[87] It topped the box office for two consecutive weekends.[88] | Toy Story 3 is the nineteenth highest-grossing film,[89] the fourth highest-grossing animated film, the third highest-grossing film of 2010,[90] the highest-grossing Pixar film, and the seventh highest-grossing Disney film.[89] It topped the box office outside North America three times, on its first ($35.0 million),[91] second,[92] and sixth weekend (which was its largest).[93] | Its highest-grossing market after North America is Japan ($126.7 million),[94] where it is the second highest-grossing U.S. animated feature (behind Finding Nemo),[7] followed by the UK and Ireland, and Malta (£73.8 million - $116.6 million), where it is the fourth highest-grossing film,[95] and Mexico ($59.4 million), where it is the second highest-grossing film.[96] It set opening weekend records for animated films in Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, China, Argentina,[97] Hong Kong,[98] Spain and the UK.[99] It is the highest-grossing animated film of all time in the UK, Ireland and Malta,[100][101] in Mexico,[96] in Hong Kong,[102][103] and in Egypt. It is the highest-grossing 2010 film in Argentina,[104] Bolivia,[105] Chile,[106] Colombia,[107] Hong Kong,[108] Mexico,[109] Spain,[110] the UK, Ireland and Malta.[111] | Toy Story 3 received universal acclaim. The film has a 99% approval rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 290 critics, with an average score of 8.9/10. The site's consensus was, \"Deftly blending comedy, adventure, and honest emotion, Toy Story 3 is a rare second sequel that really works.\"[112] Toy Story 3 was the best-reviewed film of 2010 on Rotten Tomatoes.[113] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 92 based on 39 reviews, signifying \"universal acclaim\".[114] TIME named Toy Story 3 the best film of 2010,[115] as did Quentin Tarantino.[116] In 2011, TIME named it one of \"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\".[117] Audiences surveyed by Cinemascore gave the film a grade A rating.[118] | A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, \"This film—this whole three-part, 15-year epic—about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love.\"[119] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A, saying, \"Even with the bar raised high, Toy Story 3 enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect.\"[120] Gleiberman also wrote in the next issue that he, along with many other grown men, cried at the end of the film.[121] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Woody, Buzz and playmates make a thoroughly engaging, emotionally satisfying return.\"[122] | Mark Kermode of the BBC gave the film, and the series, a glowing review, calling it \"the best movie trilogy of all time\".[123] In USA Today, Claudia Puig gave the film a complete 4 star rating, writing, \"This installment, the best of the three, is everything a movie should be: hilarious, touching, exciting and clever.\"[124] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, \"Toy Story 3 (which is pointlessly being shown in 3-D at most locations) may not be a masterpiece, but it still had me in tears at the end.\"[125] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that, \"Compared with the riches of all kinds in recent Pixar masterworks such as Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up, Toy Story 3 looks and plays like an exceptionally slick and confident product, as opposed to a magical blend of commerce and popular art.\"[126] Orlando Sentinel film critic Roger Moore, who gave the film 3½ out of 4 stars, wrote, \"Dazzling, scary and sentimental, Toy Story 3 is a dark and emotional conclusion to the film series that made Pixar famous.\"[127] | On January 25, 2011, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that Toy Story 3 was not only nominated for Best Animated Feature, but also for Best Picture. This makes Toy Story 3 not only the first animated sequel in history to be nominated for Best Picture, but also just the third animated film to ever be so nominated (following Beauty and the Beast and Up), with Toy Story 3 becoming the second Pixar film to be nominated for both awards.[128] Toy Story 3 also became the first-ever Pixar film—and the first animated feature film since Shrek—to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay,[129] though six of Pixar's previous films were nominated for the Best Original Screenplay: Toy Story,[130] Finding Nemo,[130] The Incredibles,[130] Ratatouille,[130] WALL-E,[130] and Up.[131] In 2011, it was nominated for a Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie, but lost to Despicable Me.","m_production":"According to the terms of Pixar's initial seven-film deal with Disney, all characters created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney.[14] Furthermore, Disney retained the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film,[14] though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels.[15] In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation.[16] Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board.[16]:2 | Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld wrote a script for Circle 7's version of the film. It focused on the other toys shipping a malfunctioning Buzz to Taiwan, where he was built, believing that he will be fixed there. While searching on the Internet, they find out that many more Buzz Lightyear toys are malfunctioning around the world and the company has issued a massive recall. Fearing Buzz's destruction, a group of Andy's toys (Woody, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Jessie, and Bullseye) venture out to rescue Buzz. At the same time, Buzz meets other toys from around the world that were once loved, but have now been recalled.[16] | In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a deal that put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter in charge of all Disney Animation.[17] Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and its version of Toy Story 3 was cancelled.[16]:1 The following month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney was in the process of transferring the production to Pixar.[18] John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with the story for the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a treatment.[19] | This story had no traces of the Circle 7's version of the film, since the filmmakers did not read its script: \"Not out of spite, but we wanted to start fresh, and not be influenced by what they’d done,\" said Unkrich. \"We didn't look at any of the work they'd done. We really didn't want to know anything about it.\"[20] In February 2007, Lasseter announced Toy Story 2's co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter.[21] 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date.[20] | Unkrich, who had been working with Arndt and story development artists on the film since the middle of 2006,[20] said that he felt pressure to avoid creating \"the first dud\" for Pixar, since (as of 2010) all of Pixar's films had been critical and commercial successes.[22] In February 2008, the film's plotline was reported: \"Woody the cowboy and his toy box friends are dumped in a daycare centre after their owner, Andy, leaves for college.\"[23] | During the initial development stages of the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch.[24] To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, more than a year and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.[25] | Instead of sending Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and John Ratzenberger scripts for their consideration in reprising their roles, a complete story reel of the film was shown to the actors in a theater. The reel was made up of moving storyboards with pre-recorded voices, sound effects, and music. At the conclusion of the preview, the actors signed on to the film.[26] | Dolby Laboratories announced that Toy Story 3 would be the first film that will feature theatrical 7.1 surround sound.[27] Thus, even the Blu-ray version will feature original 7.1 audio, unlike other films which were remixed into 7.1 for Blu-ray.","m_sequel":" | A sequel, titled Toy Story 4, will be released on June 15, 2018.[8] The film will be directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Josh Cooley.[164][165] The film will focus on the relationship between Woody and Bo Peep, whose role was reduced to a cameo in the third film.[166]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lee Unkrich","m_produced_by":"Darla K.

Directed by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Michael Arndt, while Unkrich wrote the story along with John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton, respectively director and co-writer of the first two films. The film was released in theaters June 18, 2010, and played worldwide from June through October[3] in the Disney Digital 3-D, RealD, and IMAX 3D formats. Toy Story 3 was the first film to be released theatrically with Dolby Surround 7.1 sound.[4] | The plot focuses on the toys Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and their friends dealing with an uncertain future as their owner, Andy, prepares to leave for college. The film features an ensemble voice cast with Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, Jodi Benson, and John Morris reprising their roles from the previous films, and Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg, Blake Clark (replacing Jim Varney), Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, Bonnie Hunt, and Jeff Garlin joining the returning cast. | Toy Story 3 became the second Pixar film (after Up) and third animated film overall (after Beauty and the Beast and Up) to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It received four more Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song, winning the latter two.[5] Toy Story 3 grossed over $1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2010—both in North America and worldwide—and the fifth-highest-grossing film at the time of its release, as well as the third highest grossing animated film of all time and the first animated film to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.[6][7] A sequel, Toy Story 4, directed by Lasseter is scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018.[8] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d \"Toy Story 3 (2010)\".
