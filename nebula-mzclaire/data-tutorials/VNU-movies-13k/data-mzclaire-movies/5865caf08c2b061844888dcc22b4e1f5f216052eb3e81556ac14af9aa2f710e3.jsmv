{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Katniss Everdeen is recovering after being attacked by Peeta Mellark, who has been brainwashed by the Capitol. | Despite Katniss's desire to kill President Snow, Alma Coin refuses to allow her into battle, as she is too valuable to risk losing. At Finnick Odair and Annie Cresta's wedding, Johanna Mason suggests Katniss sneak aboard a supply ship leaving for the Capitol. Unable to bring her back, Coin has her assigned to the \"Star Squad\", led by Boggs and includes Gale, Finnick, and Cressida. They will follow in relative safety behind the actual invasion of the Capitol providing video of their incursion for propaganda purposes. Boggs carries a holographic map (the \"Holo\") to help them evade known booby trapped \"pods\" which line the streets of the Capitol. Coin also sends Peeta to join the squad, even though he has not fully recovered from the Capitol's conditioning. | As they venture deeper into the Capitol, Boggs triggers a land mine and is fatally wounded; he gives the Holo to Katniss before dying. The squad triggers another pod which releases a flood of lethal black tar. Peeta momentarily succumbs to his conditioning and attacks Katniss, killing a squad member in the process. The group takes shelter in an abandoned building, where Jackson, the second-in-command, attempts to commandeer the Holo, until Katniss says that she is under secret orders from Coin to kill Snow. Katniss and most of the group escape just before a squad of Peacekeepers arrive and destroy the building. The Capitol broadcasts a message announcing Katniss's death, which is interrupted by Coin, who delivers an impassioned eulogy for her to rally the rebels. | The team descends into the Capitol's sewers to avoid further pods, but they are attacked by a horde of genetically engineered creatures called \"mutts\". Jackson, Castor, and Homes are killed as the squad flees through the sewers. Finnick fights off the mutts with his trident but they overwhelm him, forcing Katniss to set the Holo's self-destruct, killing him and the remaining mutts. The surviving team members reach the surface and take refuge in a shop, where Tigris, a former Hunger Games stylist and rebel sympathizer, hides them in her basement. | As rebel forces gain ground, Snow invites fleeing Capitol citizens into his mansion for protection. Katniss and Gale join the crowd, posing as refugees. As rebels arrive and attack, Peacekeepers herd Capitol children toward the palace gates. A hovercraft with Capitol markings flies overhead and drops small parcels into the crowd. The parcels explode, killing and injuring many people. A team of rebel medics attempt to help the injured, including Katniss's sister Prim. As Katniss rushes forward, a second wave of bombs detonate, killing Prim and knocking Katniss unconscious. | Upon recovering, Katniss learns the Capitol has been conquered and Snow captured. When Katniss confronts Snow, he explains that Coin orchestrated the bombing to turn his soldiers against him, reminding her that they promised not to lie to each other. She realizes that the incident resembles a trap that Gale had developed earlier. When Gale doesn't deny that it may have been based on his idea, Katniss cuts all ties with him. Coin invites the remaining Hunger Games victors to vote on a proposal to have another Hunger Games using the children of the Capitol as a symbolic gesture to satisfy the districts. Katniss swings the vote in favor, in exchange for the right to publicly execute Snow. | At the execution, Katniss kills Coin instead of Snow. Katniss is detained while Snow is killed by a band of citizens. Katniss receives a letter from Plutarch Heavensbee on her actions and is assured that she will eventually be pardoned by the newly appointed President of Panem for her crime and will be able to return to District 12 once the dissension quiets. At District 12 she is joined by Peeta, who has recovered from his condition. Commander Paylor is elected the new President of Panem, and Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch bond over their shared trauma. Years later, Katniss and Peeta play with their two children, and Katniss realizes she made the right choice.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 fell short of expectations at the box office.[95] It grossed a total of $281.7 million in North America and $371.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $653.4 million.[5] Its worldwide opening of $247.2 million is the twenty-seventh biggest of all time.[96] It is the lowest grossing film in The Hunger Games film series,[97] and the ninth highest-grossing film of 2015,[98] Lionsgate's co-chairman Rob Friedman blamed the impact of the November 2015 Paris attacks as well as Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens for the film's underwhelming performance in certain European countries and in the U.S. and Canada, further blaming the latter for cutting the film's North American gross by as much as $50–100 million.[99] However, according to Deadline.com, this is untrue given how Mockingjay – Part 2 had the lowest opening among the series and was already grossing behind Mockingjay – Part 1 by $32.7 million or 12% before The Force Awakens even opened.[100] Thus, the November attacks in Paris did not noticeably affect the European release of Mockingjay — Part 2.[101] And notably in China (where the film grossed a dismal $21.5 million), the studio blamed The Martian and Spectre for the film's underperformance there after facing competition with the two films along with Taiwanese film Our Times.[99][102] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $134.3 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[7] | In North America, according to early trackings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 was initially projected to earn around $120–125 million in its opening weekend.[103][104] However, estimates decreased to a mid-$110 million range once the film approached its opening day.[105][106] It made $16 million from its Thursday night preview which is the lowest among the franchise but the third biggest of 2015,[107] and $45.5 million on its opening day.[108] In its opening weekend, the film grossed $102.7 million, finishing first at the box office but fell below expectations and becoming the lowest opening among the franchise.[109] Sources attributed to the franchise low opening to heavy winter weather hitting areas such as South Dakota, Michigan, and Chicago as well as Lionsgate's decision to split the last novel into two separate pictures.[110] Still, it is the fourth film in the Hunger Games film series to open with more than $100 million, and is 2015's sixth-biggest opening, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Furious 7 and Minions.[111] IMAX comprised $8.5 million of the opening gross from 384 IMAX locations.[110] The low opening of the film led to the decline of Lionsgate stock the day after its opening weekend.[112] The film retained the top spot at the box office in the second weekend, declining 49.3% and grossing $52 million.[113] It topped the box office for the third consecutive weekend despite facing competition with the animated movie The Good Dinosaur and the horror comedy Krampus in its second and third weekend respectively.[114] In total, it held the No. 1 spot in the North American box office for four consecutive weekends (even after facing competition with In the Heart of the Sea in its fourth weekend), becoming the first film since Furious 7 to top the box office for four straight weekends and the second film in The Hunger Games film series after 2012's The Hunger Games to achieve this feat.[115][116] Mockingjay – Part 2 grossed a total of $281 million, 17% less than Mockingjay – Part 1 and when compared with its two other prequels is the lowest.[5][117] | Outside North America, the film was released in a total of 92 countries.[118][119] It was projected by many box office analysts to surpass the openings of all the previous Hunger Games film, considering it was the last installment, and that its release date was the same in 87 markets, including China (the latter being a rare phenomenon). It was projected to gross around $165–185 million.[92] However, it ended up earning $144.5 million across 32,500 screens from 87 markets opening at No. 1 in 81 of them.[120][121] The underperformance was attributed to the 2015 Paris terror attacks which affected many parts of Europe and the rising value of the U.S.[122] Earning $62 million (down 57%) and $30.05 million (down 49%) in its second and third weekend, respectively, it topped the international box office for four consecutive weekends.[118][119][123] | The United Kingdom posted the highest opening with $17.1 million followed by China with $15.8 million, Germany ($15 million), Mexico ($8.9 million) France ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million), Brazil ($6.8 million), Russia ($6.7 million), Venezuela ($5.6 million) and Italy ($4.3 million).[120] In China, it opened at No. 1 despite facing competition with Taiwanese film Our Times, and the continued run of Spectre and having an underperforming opening.[111][120] It fell precipitously by 88.6% in its second weekend, which is the worst second weekend drop for any major Hollywood release in China of 2015.[124][125] Notably in France, the opening was above expectations considering cinemagoers being affected by the Paris terror attacks and the heightened state of alert in Belgium at that time.[120] It topped the United Kingdom and Ireland box office for four consecutive weekends which is a rare achievement and thereby becoming the first film since Les Misérables in 2013 to have four straight weeks of win at the UK box office.[126] It is the highest-grossing film of 2015 in Colombia with $36 million.[127] In terms of total earnings its largest markets are Germany ($43.7 million) and the United Kingdom ($43.1 million) and Colombia ($36 million).[128][129] | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 has received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise aimed at the action sequences and cast performance (mainly Lawrence's, as well as Malone and Hutcherson's) and criticism aimed at the makers splitting the source material for two separate adaptations. Many critics, however, found the film a satisfying conclusion to the Hunger Games series.[130] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 70%, based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's consensus reads: \"With the unflinchingly grim Mockingjay Part 2, The Hunger Games comes to an exciting, poignant, and overall satisfying conclusion.\"[131] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[132] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.[133] | Manohla Dargis from New York Times praised Lawrence's character saying, \"Katniss is the right heroine for these neo-feminist times.\"[134] Stephen Whitty from New York Daily News said, \"'Remember that line from the first 'Hunger Games' film: \"May the odds be ever in your favor\"? Yeah, well, that luck has run out'.\"[135] Lawrence, Hutcherson, and Sutherland received praise for their performances. The supporting cast's performances, particularly Harrelson and Malone's, were also highly praised, but critics felt their appearances were too brief. Several critics also commented on the film's dark tone, even by comparison to its predecessors.[131][132] | Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly remarked, \"With its political power struggles and prodigious body count, all rendered in a thousand shades of wintry greige, the movie feels less like teen entertainment than a sort of Hunger Games of Thrones.\"[136] Robbie Collin awarded the film four out of five stars and called the film \"scorchingly tense\". In his review for The Telegraph, he praised the film for \"being intense\" and lauded the performances of Lawrence and Hoffman.\"[137] | Benjamin Lee, writing for The Guardian, felt that \"the decision to split the final chapter of the dystopian saga into two chapters looms large over a frustratingly-paced mixture of thrilling action and surprisingly dark drama.\" He praised Jennifer Lawrence's acting and Francis Lawrence's direction and commented, \"The decision to turn a 390-page book into over four hours worth of screen time (and a bonus payday) has resulted in a patchy end to a franchise that started so promisingly.\"[138] Tom Huddleston of Time Out gave the film four out of five stars. He praised the ending of film saying, \"genuinely powerful\" and commented that, \"this might be the most downbeat blockbuster in memory, a film that starts out pitiless and goes downhill from there, save for a fleeting glimmer of hope in the final moments. It’s a bold statement about the unforgiving nature of war, unashamedly political in its motives and quietly devastating in its emotional effect.\"[139]","m_production":"On July 10, 2012, Lionsgate announced that the film adaptation of Mockingjay would be split into two parts; The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1, released on November 21, 2014, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2, released November 20, 2015.[33] On November 1, 2012, Francis Lawrence, director of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, announced that he would return to direct both final films in the series.[34] Talking about direction for last two parts Francis explains, \"I felt a different kind of pressure,\" he explains. \"[On 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'], I had to prove myself a little bit as the new guy in the game. It was a relief that it was received well by the fans. Even though I was relieved, it was only momentary; it sort of set the bar higher for the next one!.\"[35] | On December 6, 2012, Danny Strong announced that he would write the third and fourth films.[36] On February 15, 2013, Lionsgate approved the script for Part 1 and gave Strong permission to write that of Part 2.[37] In August, Hemsworth confirmed that shooting of the film would begin the following month.[38] | The film's production began on September 16, 2013, in Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.[39] Studio Babelsberg co-produced and oversaw production services for the film.[40] On November 13, 2013, producer Nina Jacobson revealed that Peter Craig was also hired to write the adaptations.[1] The film carried a production budget of $160 million with a further $55 million spent on promotion and advertisements, and $13.9 million in television advertisements.[41] | All the principal cast such as Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, Liam Hemsworth as Gale, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Donald Sutherland as President Snow, Elizabeth Banks as Effie, Willow Shields as Prim, Paula Malcomson as Mrs Everdeen and Stanley Tucci as Caesar,[42] return to reprise their roles.[29] Julianne Moore also returned to reprise her role as President Alma Coin, along with Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died during the filming in February 2014, as Plutarch. He had nearly completed his scenes,[43] and his two remaining scenes were rewritten to compensate for his absence.[44] Regarding Hoffman's scenes, Lawrence commented that, \"He had two substantial scenes left and the rest were appearances in other scenes. We had no intention of trying to fake a performance, so we rewrote those scenes to give to other actors… The rest, we just didn’t have him appear in those scenes. There’s no digital manipulation or CG fabrication of any kind.\"[45] One of the changed scenes saw the character of Plutarch sending Katniss a letter in prison, read by Haymitch, rather than coming himself to talk to her after her arrest for assassinating President Coin, explained as him being unable to see her for political reasons after her actions, which he nonetheless supports. | On August 26, 2013, it was announced that actress Stef Dawson had joined the cast to portray Annie Cresta.[26] Lionsgate announced on September 13, 2013, that Julianne Moore joined the cast to play President Alma Coin.[12] The same month, Lily Rabe, Patina Miller, Mahershala Ali, Wes Chatham, and Elden Henson were announced to have joined the cast.[20][24][22] to reprise their roles of Commander Lyme, Commander Paylor, Boggs, Castor and Pollux respectively.[46] During this time, there was also a casting call for extras.[47] Rabe subsequently had to leave the film due to a scheduling conflict with the 2014 Shakespeare in the Park production of Much Ado About Nothing.[48] On April 4, 2014, it was announced that she would be replaced by Gwendoline Christie to portray Lyme.[29] | Principal photography began on September 23, 2013, in Atlanta, and concluded on June 20, 2014, in Berlin, Germany;[49] the two parts were filmed back-to-back.[6] In October 2013, filming took place in Rockmart, Georgia.[50] After the cast and crew took a break to promote The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, filming resumed on December 2, 2013. On December 14, 2013, shooting was held at the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta.[51] On December 18, shooting began at Caldwell Tanks in Newnan, Georgia.[52] | Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays Plutarch Heavensbee, died on February 2, 2014. He had completed filming his scenes for Part 1 and had a week left of shooting for Part 2; Lionsgate thereafter released a statement affirming that since the majority of Hoffman's scenes had been completed, the release date for Part 2 would not be affected.[53][54] It was initially announced that Hoffman would be digitally recreated for a major scene involving his character that had not been shot,[55][56] but Francis Lawrence later stated that he had rewritten Hoffman's two remaining scenes to compensate for the actor's absence, and there would be \"no digital manipulation or CG fabrication of any kind\".[57] In a scene near the end of the film which was to have shown Plutarch speaking with Katniss in detention, Woody Harrelson's character instead reads her a letter from him.[58] | Filming in Atlanta completed in mid April 2014,[59] and production moved to Europe.[60][61] On May 9, filming took place in Noisy le Grand, Paris.[62] It is the same location where Brazil (1985) was filmed 30 years earlier.[63] Toward the end of May, the cast and crew shot scenes at several locations in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany. In Rüdersdorf, Brandenburg, the crew shot scenes for the portrayal of District 8 in an old cement factory. Hemsworth was injured on the set and was brought to a doctor in the Berlin borough Mitte.[64] Scenes for District 2 were shot at Berlin Tempelhof Airport.[65] A German casting agency sought 1,000 ethnically diverse extras (African, Asian, Southern-European, and Turkish) and \"lived faces\" to shoot scenes at the Babelsberg Film Studio.[66]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Mockingjay  by Suzanne Collins","m_directed_by":"Francis Lawrence","m_produced_by":"Nina Jacobson | Jon Kilik","m_screenplay_by":"Peter Craig[1] | Danny Strong","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jennifer Lawrence | Josh Hutcherson | Liam Hemsworth | Woody Harrelson | Elizabeth Banks | Julianne Moore | Philip Seymour Hoffman | Jeffrey Wright | Stanley Tucci | Donald Sutherland","m_music_by":"James Newton Howard","m_cinematography":"Jo Willems","m_edited_by":"Alan Edward Bell | Mark Yoshikawa","m_production_company":"Color Force","m_distributed_by":"Lionsgate Films","m_release_dates":"November 4, 2015 (2015-11-04) (Berlin premiere) | November 20, 2015 (2015-11-20) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"137 minutes[2][3]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$160 million[4][5]","m_box_office":"$653.4 million[5] | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is a 2015 American epic dystopian science fiction war film directed by Francis Lawrence, with a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong. It is the fourth and final installment in The Hunger Games film series, and the second of two films based on the novel Mockingjay, the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy, by Suzanne Collins. Produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, and distributed by Lionsgate, the film features an ensemble cast that includes Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in his final film role), and Donald Sutherland. Principal photography on both parts of the film began on September 23, 2013 in Atlanta, before moving to Paris for two weeks of back-to-back filming and officially concluding on June 20, 2014, in Berlin and at Babelsberg Studios, Germany.[6] | The story continues from The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1, with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), as she prepares to win the war against President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the tyrannical Capitol. Together with Peeta, Gale, Finnick, and others, she travels to the Capitol to kill Snow. However, President Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of District 13 and the rebellion, hides a bigger agenda that could not only jeopardize Katniss' life, but the future of Panem. | Mockingjay – Part 2 was released on November 20, 2015 in the United States, in 2D and IMAX, and internationally in 2D, 3D, RealD Cinema, and IMAX 3D in select territories; it's the only film in the series widely released in 3D. Falling below expectations internationally and domestically with a $102.7 million gross during its opening weekend in North America, the film had the sixth-biggest opening in 2015, but held at number one at the international box-office for four consecutive weekends. The film grossed over $653 million worldwide, making it the lowest-grossing of the four films in the franchise,[5] but still a commercial success.[7] | Part 2 was positively received by critics for its performances, screenplay, and action sequences, though it was criticized for splitting the final adaptation into two separate parts. The film had garnered a nomination for Best Fantasy Film at the 42nd Saturn Awards. For her part, Lawrence was awarded as the Favorite Movie Actress at the 2016 Kids' Choice Awards and Best Hero at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards. |  | ","m_marketing":"Along with the film's first teaser poster,[71] Lionsgate released a teaser trailer on March 18, 2015, titled The Hunger Games Franchise Logo — Remember, featuring the transformation of the Mockingjay, along with notable quotes from the previous three movies, as well as a quote from the new film.[72] The teaser was also played at screenings of Lionsgate's The Divergent Series: Insurgent. Scott Mendelson of Forbes noted the similarity of the teaser with that of The Dark Knight's (2008) teaser, which also features just an animated logo of the film and select dialogue.[73] On June 1, a new teaser poster for the film, featuring a vandalised statue of President Snow, was revealed on the viral site TheCapitol.PN. On June 9, the teaser trailer for the film was released.[74] A series of different posters, featuring the main cast with red Mockingjays painted on their faces, was released in July by Lionsgate. | Later in July 2015, Lionsgate released a motion and teaser poster and propaganda video, followed by the film's official trailer. In August, a poster was released stating \"100 days until The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2\". However, it was taken down shortly thereafter, as the text on the poster appeared to resemble a swear word due to layout.[75] However, another \"bold and beautiful\" poster was released depicting Katniss standing on the shoulder of a fallen President Snow statue.[76] | In October 2015, the first official clip and the final trailer were released,[77] followed by the film's theatrical posters.[78][79] In October, fan sites revealed the first two TV spots. | \"The Mockingjay App\" was revealed on October 20. | In certain parts of Israel, the poster which depicted the image of Katniss (Lawrence) aiming her bow and arrow was removed over concerns her image would offend ultra-conservative Jewish audiences. Instead, a fiery mockingjay in the poster's background replaced Lawrence in marketing materials in multiple locations in Israel including Bnei Brak and West Jerusalem. Lionsgate did not comment on the Israeli marketing campaign.[80] In Jerusalem, public posters with the image of a female are often torn down, while Bnei Brak does not allow posters with female images.[81]","m_reference":"^ a b \"Exclusive: The Hob Interviews Frances Lawrence, Nina Jacobson & Jon Kilik at World Premiere\".
