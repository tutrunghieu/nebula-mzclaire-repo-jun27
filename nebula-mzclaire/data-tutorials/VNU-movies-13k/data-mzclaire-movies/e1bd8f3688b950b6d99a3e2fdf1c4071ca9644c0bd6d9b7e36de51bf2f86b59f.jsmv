{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Ahmad (John Justin), the naive sultan of Bagdad, is convinced by his evil Grand Vizier, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt), to go out into the city disguised as a poor man to get to know his subjects (in the manner of his grandfather Harun al-Rashid). Jaffar then has Ahmad thrown into a dungeon, where he encounters the young thief Abu (Sabu), who arranges their escape. They flee to Basra, where Ahmad meets its Princess (June Duprez). Jaffar also journeys to Basra, for he also desires the Princess. Her father, the Sultan (Miles Malleson), is fascinated by the magical mechanical flying horse that Jaffar, a skilled sorcerer, offers; he agrees to the proposed marriage. Upon hearing this, the Princess, now deeply in love with Ahmad, runs away. Confronted by Ahmad, Jaffar magically blinds him and turns Abu into a dog; the spell can only be broken if Jaffar holds the Princess in his arms. | The Princess is captured and sold in the slave market. She is bought secretly by Jaffar, but she falls into a deep sleep from which he cannot rouse her. Ahmad is tricked by Jaffar's servant Halima (Mary Morris) into awakening the Princess. Halima then lures her onto Jaffar's ship by telling her that there is a doctor aboard who can cure Ahmad's blindness. Jaffar informs the Princess about the spell, so she allows herself to be embraced; Ahmad's sight is restored and Abu is returned to human form. They pursue in a small boat, but Jaffar conjures up a storm that shipwrecks them. | Abu awakes alone on a deserted beach and finds a bottle. When he opens it, an enormous genie (Rex Ingram) appears. Embittered by his imprisonment, the genie informs Abu that he is going to kill him, but Abu tricks him back into the bottle. The genie then offers to grant Abu three wishes if he will let him out again. The hungry boy uses his first wish to ask for sausages. When Abu demands to know where Ahmad is, the genie flies Abu to the top of the highest mountain in the world, where inside a temple is an enormous statue with a large jewel, the All-Seeing Eye, set in its forehead. The genie tells Abu that the Eye will show him the location of Ahmad. Abu fights off a giant spider while climbing the statue to steal the gem. | The Princess persuades Jaffar to return her to Basra; she implores her father not to force her into the marriage. Furious when the Sultan agrees, Jaffar presents him with another mechanical toy: the \"Silver Maid\" (also Mary Morris), a many-armed dancing statue which stabs the Sultan to death. | The genie then takes Abu to Ahmad. When Ahmad asks to see the Princess, Abu has him gaze into the All-Seeing Eye, where he sees Jaffar arranging for the Princess to inhale the fragrance of the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness, which makes her forget her love. In agony, Ahmad lashes out at Abu. During the ensuing argument, Abu unthinkingly wishes Ahmad to Bagdad. The genie, freed after granting the last wish, abandons Abu in the wilderness. | Ahmad appears in Jaffar's castle and is quickly captured, but seeing him restores the Princess' memory. The furious usurper sentences them both to death. Abu, unwilling to watch further, shatters the All-Seeing Eye and is transported to the \"land of legend\", where he is thanked by the Old King (Morton Selten) for freeing its inhabitants. As a reward, he is given a magic crossbow and is named the king's successor. To save Ahmad, Abu steals the king's magic flying carpet and rushing to Ahmad's rescue. | Abu's aerial arrival in Bagdad (which fulfills a prophecy) sparks a revolt against Jaffar. Abu kills the fleeing Jaffar with his crossbow, and Ahmad regains his kingdom and his love. However, when Abu hears Ahmad telling the people of his plan to send Abu to school to train to become his new Grand Vizier, Abu instead flies away on the carpet to find fun and adventure.","m_cast":"Conrad Veidt as Jaffar | Sabu as Abu | June Duprez as the Princess | John Justin as Ahmad | Rex Ingram as the Djinn | Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra | Morton Selten as the Old King | Mary Morris as Halima, Jaffar's agent | Bruce Winston as the Merchant | Hay Petrie as the Astrologer | Adelaide Hall as the Singer | Roy Emerton as the Jailor | Allan Jeayes as the Story Teller | Alexander Korda had intended to cast Vivien Leigh as the Princess, but she went to Hollywood to be with Laurence Olivier.[6] All primary cast members are deceased.

Essentially behind Berger's back, British director Michael Powell was brought in to shoot various scenes—and Powell's scheduled work grew in amount and importance whilst, in the meantime, Korda himself did his best to undercut Berger on his own set; and while publicly siding with Berger on the issue of the music, he also undercut Berger's chosen composer (Oscar Straus) by bringing in Miklos Rozsa and putting him into an office directly adjacent to Berger's with a piano, to work on a score. Eventually, Berger was persuaded to walk away from the project, and American filmmaker Tim Whelan, who had just finished work on another Korda-produced movie (Q Planes) was brought in to help augment Powell's work. But with the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, work was suspended as Powell was taken off the picture and put to work on a morale-boosting documentary, The Lion Has Wings. | By the end of the year, Korda found himself running out of money and credit, and in the spring of 1940 he arranged to move the entire production to Hollywood (where some shots of the movie's young star Sabu, had to be redone since he'd grown more than three inches during the year since shooting had commenced). Powell had remained in England, and so direction was taken up in Hollywood by Menzies and Zoltan Korda during the summer of 1940—including shots of the heroes in the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and The Painted Desert; the scenes in the Temple of the Goddess of Light, among the very last to be written, were done late in the summer, and the film was being edited and re-structured into the fall of 1940.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Powell Ludwig Berger Tim Whelan Uncredited: Alexander Korda Zoltan Korda William Cameron Menzies","m_produced_by":"Alexander Korda","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Conrad Veidt Sabu John Justin June Duprez Rex Ingram","m_music_by":"Miklós Rózsa","m_cinematography":"George Perinal","m_edited_by":"Charles Crichton","m_production_company":"London Films","m_distributed_by":"United Artists (UK/US)","m_release_dates":"5 December 1940 (1940-12-05) (US) | 25 December 1940 (1940-12-25) (UK) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"106 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"over $1 million (US/Canada)[1] 5,134,653 admissions (France, 1946)[2] | The Thief of Bagdad is a 1940 British Technicolor Arabian fantasy film produced by Alexander Korda and directed by Michael Powell, Ludwig Berger, and Tim Whelan, with additional contributions by Korda's brothers Vincent and Zoltán, and William Cameron Menzies.
