{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On her 18th birthday, India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska)—a girl with a strong acuteness of the senses—has her life turned upside down after her loving father Richard (Dermot Mulroney) dies in a horrific car accident. India is then left with her unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). At Richard's funeral, Evelyn and India are introduced to Richard's charming and charismatic brother Charlie (Matthew Goode), who has spent his life traveling the world. He then announces that he is staying indefinitely to help support India and Evelyn, much to Evelyn's delight and India's chagrin. | Shortly after Charlie moves in, India witnesses him argue with Mrs. McGarrick (Phyllis Somerville), the head caretaker of the house. Mrs. McGarrick then disappears. Charlie and Evelyn grow closer and intimate while India continues to rebuff Charlie's attempts to befriend her. Later, India's great aunt Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver) arrives to visit the family, much to Evelyn and Charlie's dismay. At dinner, Gwendolyn shows surprise at Charlie's claims of traveling the world and tells Evelyn that she needs to talk to her about Charlie. | Gwendolyn ends up changing hotels due to an unexplained fear and suspicion of Charlie. However, she loses her cell phone and tries to call the Stokers' home from her hotel payphone. While she is making her call, Charlie tracks her down and corners her in the phone booth, seeming to be upset. He hands Gwendolyn her phone and then strangles her to death with his belt after explaining that he found her through the cab company. Meanwhile, India goes into the basement to eat ice cream and discovers Mrs. McGarrick's body in the freezer. She realizes Charlie is a murderer. | Later, India unleashes her inner aggression at school and stabs a bully, Chris Pitts (Lucas Till), in the hand with a pencil after he tries to land a surprise punch to her head. This draws the attention of another classmate, Whip Taylor (Alden Ehrenreich). India goes home and later witnesses Evelyn and Charlie growing intimate and wanders off to a local diner where she runs into Whip. She and Whip go into the woods where they proceed to make out until India aggressively bites Whip. Whip then attempts to rape India until Charlie intervenes, and breaks Whip's neck with his belt. India then aids Charlie in burying the body in her garden. She then attempts to call Gwendolyn, but hears her phone ring deep in the garden, realizing Charlie killed her, too. India takes a shower and masturbates to the memory of the murder, climaxing as she remembers Charlie breaking Whip's neck. | While going through Richard's office to gather things of his she wants to keep, India discovers that a key she received as a birthday present belongs to a locked drawer to Richard's desk. Inside, she finds dozens of letters Charlie wrote to her over the years, which detail his travels and express his love for his niece, although they have never met. However, India discovers that the sending address on the back of the envelopes is from a mental institution. India then confronts Charlie, who explains the truth: Charlie murdered his and Richard's younger brother Jonathan as a child because he was jealous that Richard paid more attention to him. Charlie was then put in a mental institution. When released on India's 18th birthday, Richard gave Charlie a car, a generous amount of money, and an apartment in New York on the condition that he stay away from Richard's family. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Charlie beat Richard to death with a rock and staged the car accident. | At first, India is in shock and angered. However, she seemingly forgives Charlie and grows closer after he provides an alibi for her when Sheriff Howard (Ralph Brown) questions her about Whip's disappearance. They grow close to intimate before Evelyn witnesses them. Later that evening, Evelyn coldly expresses her desire to watch India suffer before confronting Charlie, implying that she knows the truth about Richard's death. Charlie seduces Evelyn and then attempts to strangle her before India appears and fatally shoots Charlie with a rifle. She then buries Charlie's body in the backyard and proceeds to leave for New York in his car. | She is shortly pulled over for speeding by Sheriff Howard, who then asks her why she's in a hurry. India replies that she wanted to catch his attention, then plunges a pair of pruning shears into his neck. India pursues the wounded sheriff into a field to dispatch him with her rifle.","m_cast":"Mia Wasikowska as India Stoker | Matthew Goode as Charlie Stoker | Nicole Kidman as Evelyn Stoker | Dermot Mulroney as Richard Stoker | Jacki Weaver as Aunt Gwendolyn \"Gin\" Stoker | Lucas Till as Chris Pitts | Alden Ehrenreich as Whip Taylor | Phyllis Somerville as Mrs. McGarrick | Ralph Brown as Sheriff Howard | Judith Godrèche as Doctor Jacquin","m_reception":"The film has received positive reviews from critics; it currently holds a 69% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 182 reviews.[22] The site's consensus states: \"Its script doesn't quite carry the dramatic heft of his earlier work, but Park Chan-wook's Stoker showcases his eye for sumptuous imagery and his affection for dark, atmospheric narratives populated by mysterious characters.\"[22] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 58 out of 100, based on 42 reviews.[23] | The film premiered at Sundance and the reviews were mostly positive. In The Guardian, critic Jeremy Kay called the film \"a gorgeously mounted family mystery dressed up as a gothic fairytale\", and said the film presents viewers with clues worthy of Hitchcock: \"Literary references and symbolism abound in Stoker. You can get tied up trying to figure out who is what. That is the idea. All the clues are there. You just have to look closely.\" The Guardian awarded Stoker four out of five stars in its review.[24] | Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4, calling it \"disturbingly good\".[25] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 4, and called it a \"thriller of savage beauty\".[26] Writing for Variety, Guy Lodge praised the film, calling it \"a splendidly demented gumbo of Hitchcock thriller\".[27] | Brian Moylan of Hollywood.com praised the performances of Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode saying \"Kidman is at her finest as a disinterested mother. She shows fear and disdain in the most subtle ways, never overplaying a character that could turn into a campy arch villain with just the tiniest bit of scene-chewing. And Goode is the most menacing of all, the malevolent force that hides behind the facade not only of normalcy but of something attractive that you know is incredibly dangerous.\"[28] | Not all reviews were positive; David Thomson, writing for The New Republic, said that \"Stoker trembles between the portentous and the ridiculous, and I think you know which one is going to win.\"[29] In addition, Josh Slater-Williams of The Skinny labelled the film a \"relentless, hollow mess\".[30] | Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, \"Stoker is constantly engaging, suitably intense, certainly different, always suspenseful and even stylishly directed, but it is not Oldboy\".[31] | Kidman's performance as Evie was included on TribecaFilm.com as one of the year's most underrated performances. The author claimed \"Kidman exploits Evelyn’s fragility with her every glance and gesture. Kidman as Evelyn radiates a strange kind of unnerving elegance.\"[32]","m_production":"Wentworth Miller, mostly known as an actor, wrote the screenplay for Stoker, as well as a prequel, Uncle Charlie.[4] He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke for submitting his work, later explaining \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\"[5] Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\" of the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood.[6] Miller described it as a \"horror film, a family drama and a psychological thriller\".[4] Although influenced by Bram Stoker's Dracula,[7] Miller clarified that Stoker was \"not about vampires. It was never meant to be about vampires but it is a horror story. A stoker is one who stokes, which also ties in nicely with the narrative.\"[4] Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt also influenced the film. Miller said: \"The jumping-off point is actually Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. So, that's where we begin, and then we take it in a very, very different direction.\"[4] | The film marked director Park Chan-wook's English-language debut. In January 2011, it was reported that Mia Wasikowska was in negotiations to play India,[8] and in February, Nicole Kidman also entered negotiations to join the cast.[9] In June, it was reported that Matthew Goode was in talks to play Charlie,[10] after Colin Firth, who was attached earlier, had to drop out.[11] Jacki Weaver, Lucas Till, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Brown and Dermot Mulroney joined the cast in July and August 2011.[12][13][14][15] | Filming took 40 days[16] beginning in Nashville, Tennessee, in September 2011.[17] The motel scenes were filmed in nearby Murfreesboro on 22 September, and additional scenes were shot in Sewanee, home of the University of the South.[17][18] Principal photography wrapped on 23 October. | Composer Philip Glass was originally hired to compose the film's score but was replaced by Clint Mansell.[19] Two of Glass' compositions for solo piano are still included in the finished film however, as revealed in the movie credits.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Park Chan-wook","m_produced_by":"Ridley Scott Tony Scott Michael Costigan","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mia Wasikowska Matthew Goode Dermot Mulroney Jackie Weaver Nicole Kidman","m_music_by":"Clint Mansell","m_cinematography":"Chung-hoon Chung","m_edited_by":"Nicolas De Toth","m_production_company":"Indian Paintbrush Scott Free Productions","m_distributed_by":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","m_release_dates":"20 January 2013 (2013-01-20) (Sundance) | 1 March 2013 (2013-03-01) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"99 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$12 million[2]","m_box_office":"$12,077,441[2] | Stoker is a 2013 British-American psychological thriller-horror film written by Wentworth Miller and directed by South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook in his English-language debut.
