{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In ancient China, a brutal and tyrannical warlord unites the country's kingdoms into an empire and becomes the Dragon Emperor. He orders the construction of the Great Wall of China to bury and curse his dead enemies, eventually learning power over the classical elements fire, water, earth, wood and metal. The Emperor soon grows fearful that his death will end all he has accomplished and summons Zi Yuan, a sorceress who is said to know the secret of immortality. She seemingly casts a spell on the Emperor in Sanskrit, before he executes General Ming, his trusted friend and Zi Yuan's secret lover. But foreseeing such events, Zi Yuan immolates and detains the Emperor, transforming his army into the Terracotta Army, and flees. | In 1946, Alex O'Connell, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell's son, and his archaeology professor Roger Wilson locates the Emperor's tomb. Though attacked by a mysterious woman, they succeed in bringing the coffin to Shanghai. Meanwhile, the British government entrusts the O'Connells to take the Eye of Shangri-La back to China. However, they learn that Wilson works for a rogue military faction led by General Yang, who had provided the financial backing of Alex's expedition. Yang plans to resurrect the Emperor using the Eye, which contains the Elixer of Life. They open it but accidentally lands on the carriage driver statue, actually revealed to be the Emperor's mummified body. He accepts Yang's service but kills Wilson and escapes. | Along with Evelyn's brother Jonathan Carnahan, the O'Connells and the mysterious woman, Lin, travel to a stupa in the Himalayas that will reveal the path to Shangri-La when the Eye is placed on top of it. With the help of Yetis summoned by Lin, the group hold off Yang's soldiers but the Emperor discovers Shangri-La's location. Alex attempts to trigger an avalanche. The Emperor throws a dagger at him, but Rick shoves Alex and is stabbed instead. Lin takes the group to Shangri-La, where Zi Yuan still lives and heals Rick's wound. The group discovers that Lin is Zi Yuan's daughter, both rendered immortal due to the power of Shangri-La's waters. As Rick heals, Alex and Lin have grown attached to each other, but Lin refuses due to her immortality; unable to bear falling in love with Alex only to watch him grow old and die, just as Zi Yuan mourned for General Ming. | The Emperor and General Yang eventually arrive and attack them in Shangri-La, and the Emperor bathes in the mystical waters, which restores his human form and youth, and gives him the ability to shapeshift. Transforming into a dragon, the Emperor kidnaps Lin and flies back to the tomb, raising his Terracota Army, planning to cross the Great Wall, where they will be invincible. The O'Connells and Zi Yuan pursue the Emperor to the Great Wall where she sacrifices her and Lin's immortality to create an undead army from beneath The Great Wall, led by a revived General Ming. As Alex rescues Lin, Zi Yuan fights the Emperor and is mortally wounded, but secures the dagger. Zi Yuan gives the dagger to the group before dying. Meanwhile, the Emperor goes into the Great Wall to use his elemental powers to negate the undead spell. Rick and Alex fight off the Emperor while Evelyn and Lin fight and kill Yang. The Emperor gains the upper hand over Rick, but Rick and Alex manage to stab the Emperor with the dagger, killing him and defeating the Terracotta Army. Ming's army briefly celebrates before finally moving on to a peaceful afterlife. | The O'Connells return to Shanghai while Jonathan decides to move to Peru with the Eye of Shangri-La, as he wants to go somewhere with no mummies. However, in postscript, it is revealed that upon his arrival, mummies were discovered in Peru.","m_cast":"Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell | Jet Li as Emperor Han | Maria Bello as Evelyn Carnahan O'Connell | John Hannah as Jonathan Carnahan, Evelyn's brother | Luke Ford as Alex O'Connell | Michelle Yeoh as Zi Yuan | Liam Cunningham as Mad Dog Maguire, Rick's old friend | Isabella Leong as Lin, Zi Yuan's daughter | Anthony Wong as General Yang, a renegade Chinese officer | Russell Wong as General Ming Guo, the Emperor's servant, and Zi Yuan's lover | Jessey Meng as Choi, General Yang's aide. | David Calder as Professor Roger Wilson, General Yang's spy","m_reception":null,"m_production":"In November 2001, director Stephen Sommers, who directed the previous Mummy films, said about directing a third film, \"There is a demand for it, but most of the gang would only be up for it again if we could find a way to make it bigger and better.\"[3] In May 2004, he expressed his doubts about having the energy to make a third film, though the cast of previous films had expressed interest in returning.[4] In December 2005, he reviewed a script written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar was about a Chinese mummy (China's first emperor, who wants to take over the world with his army of accursed warriors in 1940). | The idea of The Emperor and his army is based on the real-life Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang, who was buried amidst thousands of crafted and fired terra cotta soldiers, called the Terracotta Army, dated at latest to 210 BC. (Incidentally, the Terracotta Army is actually mentioned at the end of the novelization as something that will be discovered in the future, although its relation to The Emperor's army, or rather how the destroyed army made it into the site, is left unexplained.)[5] | In March 2006, actor Oded Fehr, who played Ardeth Bay in the first two films said Sommers had told him a third film was in development and being written, with only Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz's characters returning.[6] The following September, Universal Pictures offered director Joe Johnston the helm, instead of Jurassic World but Johnston declined.[7] Later in the month, Weisz expressed interest in reprising her role.[8] | In January 2007, Universal announced Sommers would not be attached to direct the third film. It was then announced that Universal entered talks with director Rob Cohen to take over directing duties.[9] Later in the month, the story was revealed to center around Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz's characters, as well as their adult son. Negotiations with the actors were in progress at that time.[10] In February, casting began for the role of Alex O'Connell. Additionally, John Hannah reprised his role as Jonathan.[2] Also in that month, Cohen mentioned that Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh would star in the film although the official confirmation wasn't published until May.[11][12] | In April, Brendan Fraser re-joined the cast for the film.[13] Weisz did not, citing \"problems with the script\" in addition to having just given birth to her son.[14][15] The film was shot in Montreal[16] and China. The film was reported to be titled The Mummy 3: Curse Of The Dragon.[17] In April, Luke Ford was cast as Alex O'Connell,[18] replacing Freddie Boath in the role and in May, Maria Bello was cast to replace Weisz in the role of Evelyn. Bello commented during an interview that the new \"Evy\" is different from the original \"Evy\". \"She has the same name, but she is quite a different character,\" said Bello.[19] At a news conference in Shanghai, Bello told the audience that \"Rob Cohen has 'created a new Evelyn ... in the first two Mummy movies she was all actiony and lovely, but this Evelyn might be a little more ... forceful in terms of her martial art skills and shooting skills'\".[20] | Principal photography started at Montreal's Mel’s Cite du Cinema. There, the Eye of Shangri-la scenes were shot by production designer Nigel Phelps. The team then shot on the courtyard set of gateway to Shangri-la. The courtyard was dressed with fake snow, created by effects supervisor Bruce Steinheimer’s team.[21] | At the city's ADF stage, Phelps’s team created sets of the Terra Cotta mausoleum. Set decorator Anne Kuljian designed 20 different statue heads that were sculpted by 3D Arts team and interchanged between shots. One soldier and horse statue was bought from China, and copies of it as well as \"The Dragon Emperor\" were made (Jet Li's statue was sculpted by Lucie Fournier, Tino Petronzio, and Nick Petronzio in a workshop in Montreal). Propmaster Kim Wai Chung supervised the making of the horses’ bridles and mausoleum ornaments in China. Meanwhile, at Mel’s, the brutal battle between the Emperor and Rick was filmed, the first scene shot with Jet Li.[21][22] | On October 15, 2007, the team moved to China. At Shanghai Studios, a set depicting the city in the 1940s was used for the chase sequence and was shot in three weeks. General Yang’s camp was filmed in a Ming village near Tian Mo. At the studio, Chinese cultural advisers aided Cohen in depicting the Qin Dynasty language and ceremonies.[21] The O'Connell family's drama scenes were shot in an Egyptian-themed nightclub suitably named \"Imhotep's\".[23] | The crew frequently had to halt in and near Shanghai when soldiers marched. The desert battlefield's setting was actually a training facility for the Chinese army that was leased.[24] | The visual effects were done by two Los Angeles-based VFX houses. Rhythm and Hues Studios designed the Yetis and dragons, while Digital Domain handled the battle scenes with Jet Li's terracotta warriors. The pool of water resembling diamonds took Rhythm and Hues eleven months to complete.[25] The A.I. software Massive, used for the Lord of the Rings films, was used to create the undead battle scenes. | Design company Imaginary Forces created the opening title sequence and end titles. IF designers also shot real paint splatters and brushstrokes. To portray an \"accurate and historic China,\" they turned to calligrapher T.Z. Yuan for ink brush writing.[26] | Most of the film's score was composed by Randy Edelman and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The soundtrack features numerous different Chinese and Middle Eastern ethnic instruments along with classic British folklore. The soundtrack was released on July 29, 2008[28] by Varèse Sarabande label, two days before the film's release. Composer John Debney (who had previously scored the music for the Mummy franchise's spin-off The Scorpion King) provided additional re-scored material for most of the bigger action sequences. The Hollywood Studio Symphony recorded thirty minutes of Debney's music in less than ten hours at the Fox Scoring Stage in July 2008, shortly before the film's release; however, the soundtrack album features Edelman's score and none of Debney's. The trailer prominently features the cues \"Armada\" by Two Steps From Hell and \"DNA Reactor\" by Pfeifer Broz. Music, the latter which also plays at the end of the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix trailer. It also plays Vampire Hunters by Wojciech Kilar, which was used in the first film's trailer. | The soundtrack features \"The Flower Duet\" by Léo Delibes from his opera Lakmé.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters created  by Stephen Sommers Lloyd Fonvielle Kevin Jarre","m_directed_by":"Rob Cohen","m_produced_by":"Sean Daniel Bob Ducsay James Jacks Stephen Sommers","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Brendan Fraser Jet Li Maria Bello John Hannah Russell Wong Liam Cunningham Luke Ford Isabella Leong Michelle Yeoh","m_music_by":"Randy Edelman John Debney (uncredited)","m_cinematography":"Simon Duggan","m_edited_by":"Joel Negron Kelly Matsumoto","m_production_company":"Relativity Media The Sommers Company Alphaville Films","m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"August 1, 2008 (2008-08-01)","m_running_time":"111 minutes","m_country":"United States Canada Germany China","m_language":"English Chinese Sanskrit Tibetan","m_budget":"$145 million[1]","m_box_office":"$401.1 million | The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor[2] is a 2008 American action dark fantasy adventure horror film and is the third and final installment in the Mummy trilogy.
