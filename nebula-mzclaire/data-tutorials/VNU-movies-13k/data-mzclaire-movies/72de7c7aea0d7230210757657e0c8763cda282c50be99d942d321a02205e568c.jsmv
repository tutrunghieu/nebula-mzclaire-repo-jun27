{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The \"Green Wizard\" Carolinus (Harry Morgan) discovers magic failing as humanity embraces science, and summons his brothers Lo Tae Zhao the Yellow Wizard (Don Messick); Solarius the Blue Wizard (James Earl Jones); and Ommadon the Red Wizard (also voiced by James Earl Jones), accompanied by their dragons Shen Tsu, Lunarian, and Bryagh (James Gregory), before whom he resolves to create a \"Last Realm of Magic\" hidden from the rest of the world. Lo Tae Zhao and Solarius consent, but Ommadon instead proposes to take control of the world himself; whereupon the other wizards decide to seize Ommadon's crown, the source of his powers. Because the wizards are forbidden to fight among themselves, they volunteer Carolinus's dragon Gorbash (Bob McFadden when not Ritter-as-Peter) and the knight Sir Orrin Neville-Smythe (Bob McFadden), to do so, with Solarius giving a shield to deflect dark magic and Lo Tae Zhao giving a flute to lull dragons to sleep. Requiring a third protagonist, Carolinus summons Peter Dickinson (John Ritter), a board-game creator and polymath scientist. Having arrived in the magical world, Peter becomes enamored of Princess Milisande (Alexandra Stoddart), Carolinus's ward. | Ommadon, learning the others' plan, sends his dragon Bryagh to capture Peter; whereupon Carolinus casts a spell to save him, which mistakenly combines Peter's mind with the body of Gorbash. Knowing nothing about being a dragon or about magic, Peter is mentored by an older dragon named Smrgol (James Gregory). During their journey they are joined by the wolf Aragh (Victor Buono), a woodland elf named Giles, and the archer Danielle of the Woodlands (Nellie Bellflower). The dichotomy of magic and science appears when Smrgol teaches Peter in magical terms, whilst Peter explains them with principles of science; and in later approaches of each character to similar subjects. In Carolinus's home Princess Milisande falls into a trance and views the protagonists magically from afar. At an inn near Ommadon's realm, an Ogre captures Sir Orrin and Danielle. Smrgol teaches Peter how to defeat the Ogre, but defeats the Ogre himself after Peter is subdued. Smrgol then dies of his injuries. In the Red Wizard's realm, the heroes face the Worm of Sligoff, a giant worm that excretes sulfuric acid (ignited by Peter), followed by an evil spell designed to induce hopelessness, which Peter repels by Solarius' shield. When Ommadon sends an army of dragons against the heroes, Giles plays the flute given by Lo Tae Zhao, which puts them all to sleep except Bryagh, who seems to kill Giles, Aragh, and Danielle but is slain by Sir Orrin, who dies soon after. When Ommadon appears on the battlefield, Peter separates himself from Gorbash, and confronts him. Here, Peter's explanations of science against Ommadon's declarations of magic destroy Ommadon; whereupon the others are restored to life and the \"Last Realm of Magic\" takes shape. Peter, having \"denied\" magic to overcome Ommadon, returns to his own world, taking the flute and shield, which he sells to pay his debts. He is then joined by Princess Milisande, who comes bearing Ommadon's crown, and the two embrace.","m_cast":"Nellie Bellflower - Danielle | Victor Buono - Aragh the Wolf | James Earl Jones - Ommadon (credited), Solarius (uncredited) | Paul Frees - Antiquity (uncredited) | James Gregory - Bryagh the Dragon, Smrgol the Dragon (both credited) | Jack Lester - | Bob McFadden - Gorbash the Dragon, Sir Orrin Neville-Smythe | Don Messick - Giles of the Treetops, Lo Tae Zhao | Harry Morgan - Carolinus | Ed Peck - | John Ritter - Peter Dickinson | Alexandra Stoddart - Princess Milisande | Larry Storch - Pawnbroker","m_reception":"Filmsy.com said of the film, \"Animated fantasy films geared for family viewing just aren’t made like this anymore... The voice acting in this movie is excellent, to say the least... Though the animation might seem a bit 'dated', it remains beautiful by 1982 standards\".[3] \"The dialogue is surprisingly intelligent and may confuse some children but it is nice to see an animated film that will stimulate adult minds a little...

Dickson. The film centers upon a quest undertaken to stop an evil wizard who plans to rule the world by dark magic. A major theme within the story is the question of whether science and magic can co-exist. This is told mostly through the experience of character Peter Dickinson, drawn from the 20th century into the magical realm. | Released direct to video on August 17, 1982, it was aired as an ABC \"Saturday Night Movie\" on August 2, 1986, and released by Warner Brothers as a made-to-order DVD in the US on 17 November 2009 as part of the \"Warner Archive Collection\".[1][2] | The opening song is sung by Don McLean. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://www.wbshop.com/Flight-of-the-Dragons-The/1000179884,default,pd.html?cgid= | ^ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA5A0C/ref=s9_simh_gw_p74_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0Y02SHW5T4Y4X738AYAC&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846 | ^ http://www.filmsy.com/reviews/the-flight-of-dragons/ | ^ http://blogcritics.org/video/article/movie-review-the-flight-of-dragons/ | ^ http://www.badmovieplanet.com/unknownmovies/reviews/rev302.html | ^ http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/flightdragons.php","m_external_link":"The Flight of Dragons at the Internet Movie Database | The Wonderful World of Rankin-Bass | The Flight of Dragons Live Action Movie; 2014","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/FlightofDragonsDVD.jpg/220px-FlightofDragonsDVD.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Romeo Muller (Screenplay) Peter Dickinson (Novel) Gordon R.
