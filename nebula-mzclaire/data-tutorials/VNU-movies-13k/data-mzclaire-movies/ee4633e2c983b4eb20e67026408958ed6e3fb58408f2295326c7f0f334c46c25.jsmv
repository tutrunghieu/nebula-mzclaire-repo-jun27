{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jimmy Connors (Mickey Rooney), a student at Riverwood High School, also plays the drums in the school band, but dreams of playing in a dance band. He and his \"pal\" Mary Holden (Judy Garland) sell the school principal the idea of forming the band and putting on a dance. The principal is initially doubtful, but then agrees to buy the first ticket. The event is a success and the school's debt for the instruments in paid off. | Famous band leader Paul Whiteman (played by himself) sponsors a contest in Chicago for the best high school musical group, and Jimmy decides the band must compete. In three weeks, the kids write, plan, and put on a show. The melodrama, called \"Nell from New Rochelle\", is also a success and raises the money to go to Chicago, but they're still short. A loan from Whiteman himself solves that problem. But when a member of the cast is injured and needs a critical and urgent operation, the band gives the money up so that the injured student can be flown to Chicago for the operation. | The band raises the money anyway, competes in Chicago, and wins the $500 prize. To Jimmy goes the honor of leading all the bands in a grand finale performance.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"According to MGM records the film earned $2,265,000 in the US and Canada and $1,229,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $1,539,000.[1] | Daily Variety: | Movie and Radio Guide, 1940: | Variety, September 18, 1940:","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Busby Berkeley","m_produced_by":"Arthur Freed","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Judy Garland Mickey Rooney","m_music_by":"(see article)","m_cinematography":"Ray June","m_edited_by":"Ben Lewis","m_production_company":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_distributed_by":"Loew's Inc.","m_release_dates":"September 27, 1940 (1940-09-27)","m_running_time":"120 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$854,000[1]","m_box_office":"$3,494,000[1] | Strike Up the Band is a 1940 American black and white musical film produced by the Arthur Freed unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M-G-M) and distributed by its parent company, Loew's Inc..
