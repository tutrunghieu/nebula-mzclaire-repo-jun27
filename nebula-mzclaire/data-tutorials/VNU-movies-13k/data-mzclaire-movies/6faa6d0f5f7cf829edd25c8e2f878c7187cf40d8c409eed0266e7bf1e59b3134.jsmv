{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In contemporary London, Charles Dobbs (James Mason) is a staid MI5 operative investigating Foreign Office official Samuel Fennan, a former Communist who apparently commits suicide. Dobbs becomes suspicious when a wake-up call is made to Fennan's home the next morning. While his widow Elsa (Simone Signoret) says it was for her, this is discovered to be a lie. Dobbs then suspects that Elsa, a survivor of an extermination camp, might have some clues, but other officials want Dobbs to drop the case. Dobbs privately links up with retired police inspector Mendel (Harry Andrews) to continue inquiries. As they uncover a network of Communist agents, Dobbs also discovers that his wife Ann (Harriet Andersson) is leaving him for a former wartime colleague in Switzerland, Dieter Frey (Maximilian Schell), who may have used access to her to gain knowledge of Dobbs' movements. Dobbs uses his knowledge of Dieter to set a trap, which proves that Elsa is the spy and Dieter is her control. In a final confrontation, Dieter strangles Elsa and shoots Mendel but is killed bare handed by the enraged Dobbs.","m_cast":"James Mason as Charles Dobbs | Simone Signoret as Elsa Fennan | Maximilian Schell as Dieter Frey | Harriet Andersson as Ann Dobbs | Harry Andrews as Inspector Mendel | Kenneth Haigh as Bill Appleby | Roy Kinnear as Adam Scarr | Max Adrian as Adviser | Lynn Redgrave as Virgin | Robert Flemyng as Samuel Fennan | Leslie Sands as Inspector | Corin Redgrave as David | Sheraton Blount as Eunice Scarr (uncredited) | Michael Brennan as Wolfe the Barman (uncredited)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Location shooting for The Deadly Affair took place in London, in St. James's Park, at the Balloon Tavern and the Chelsea Embankment in Chelsea, in Clapham and Barnes, and in Twickenham.
