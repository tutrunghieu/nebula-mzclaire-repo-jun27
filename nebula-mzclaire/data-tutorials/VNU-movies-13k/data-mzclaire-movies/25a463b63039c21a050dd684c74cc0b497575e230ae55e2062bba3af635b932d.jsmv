She tells Barry that while she gave Barry's father 35 of the best years of her life, she's going to start living life her way with the man she really loves. | Jack (Jack Mulcahy) has purchased their parents' home and lives in it with his wife Molly. Jack is torn between his love for Molly and his lust for Ann, a former romantic interest of Barry's. | Barry and the youngest brother, Pat (Mike McGlone) ask to temporarily move in with Jack, to which he reluctantly agrees. Pat plans to break his engagement to Susan, but becomes depressed when she breaks up with him. After much pleading, Susan decides to take Pat back. Pat then decides to end the relationship for good for Leslie, an auto mechanic. They decide to head out to California together in a classic car that Leslie has been working on. | Barry shows no interest in a long-term relationship, until he meets Audrey (Maxine Bahns), a woman whom he accuses of \"stealing\" an apartment that he was trying to rent for himself. Though things do not go well between them at first, they warm up to one another and start a relationship. | Molly learns of Jack's affair after finding a wrapped condom in his pants as she is cleaning up after him one day. She confronts Jack, but he refuses to discuss it. | Jack finally breaks it off for good with Ann. He then returns home determined to rebuild his wounded marriage, but not before paying a visit to his father's grave, promising (in a voice-over) that he will be a better husband to his wife than his father was, pouring a bottle of Irish whiskey over the grave. | Barry decides to move in with Audrey and take their relationship to the next level. The movie ends with all three brothers gathering at the family homestead with a newfound belief in love and a desire to not let the ghosts of the past stand in their way.","m_cast":"Edward Burns as Barry McMullen | Mike McGlone as Patrick McMullen | Jack Mulcahy as Jack McMullen | Connie Britton as Molly McMullen | Shari Albert as Susan | Maxine Bahns as Audry | Peter Johansen as Marty | Elizabeth McKay as Ann | Jennifer Jostyn as Leslie","m_reception":"The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.
