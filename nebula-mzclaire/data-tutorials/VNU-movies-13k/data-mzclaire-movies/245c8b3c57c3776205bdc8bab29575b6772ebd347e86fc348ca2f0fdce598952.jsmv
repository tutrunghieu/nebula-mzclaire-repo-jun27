{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Retired police detective Jerry Black is seen mumbling to himself, apparently drunk, sitting on a bench outside a disused gas station. The scene then shifts to events in the recent past. Jerry is ice fishing, then driving to work. After work, he goes to a restaurant, where the Department has thrown him a retirement party. Police captain Eric Pollack gives Jerry a gift, a fishing trip in Mexico. The party is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime. | Jerry delivers the bad news to the child's parents. The mother makes Jerry swear on a cross that he will find the killer. A suspect is found the next day. Stan goes in to interview the suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with mental retardation. During the interview, the man eventually confesses but steals a gun from one of the deputies and commits suicide. To the other detectives, the case is over, but Jerry does not think that the killer died that night. He is adamant about his pledge to find the killer, and does not go on the fishing trip. Instead, Jerry visits the victim's grandmother, who tells him of the many stories that Ginny told. A later visit to one of her friends reveals that Ginny had a friend she called \"The Giant\". Jerry sees a picture Ginny drew of \"The Giant\", who does not resemble the man charged with the murder, and a black station wagon. He takes the picture with him. | Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's further investigation leads him to three unsolved and similar cases that Wadenah could not have committed. Jerry shows the child's picture and presents his research to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful. | Jerry rents a cabin and spends time fishing. He notices a gas station near the lake and likes the location so much he asks the owner if he is interested in selling the place. It is implied that Jerry wants to use the station to track the killer. Jerry buys the gas station and moves into the house behind it, meets local bartender Lori, and slowly becomes a father figure to her daughter Chrissy. | Soon, Chrissy becomes friends with a local pastor, Gary Jackson. Jerry is uncomfortable about this and begins to think Jackson is the killer. Chrissy is shown meeting a man driving a black car with a toy hedgehog hanging on the rear mirror—hedgehogs being another aspect of Ginny's drawing that Jerry believes to be a clue. Chrissy explains to Jerry that she met a wizard who gave her hedgehog candies and told her not to tell her parents they met—she figured it was OK to tell Jerry, since he is not her father. Jerry realizes this is the killer and, using Chrissy as bait, stages an operation, with Stan's help, to catch him. | A car is shown driving with a porcupine hanging from the rear-view mirror. The woman who owned the chocolate shop is shown searching for \"Oliver\", implying that he is the killer. After hours of waiting, Stan and the other police leave. They tell Lori what happened, and after racing to the place, Lori confronts Jerry angrily about putting her daughter in danger. The car that was shown approaching is seen destroyed in a fiery collision with a freight truck. | In the final scene, reflecting the first, Jerry sits on a bench in front of the ruined gas station, apparently drunk, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there.","m_cast":"Jack Nicholson as Jerry Black | Patricia Clarkson as Margaret Larsen | Benicio del Toro as Toby Jay Wadenah | Aaron Eckhart as Stan Krolak | Helen Mirren as Doctor | Tom Noonan as Gary Jackson | Robin Wright Penn as Lori | Vanessa Redgrave as Annalise Hansen | Mickey Rourke as Jim Olstad | Sam Shepard as Eric Pollack | Harry Dean Stanton as Floyd Cage | Dale Dickey as Strom | Costas Mandylor as Monash Deputy | Michael O'Keefe as Duane Larsen | Lois Smith as Helen Jackson | Brittany Tiplady as Becky Fiske | Eileen Ryan as Jean","m_reception":"The Pledge did not perform well at the box office.

The film has a \"certified fresh\" score of 78% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 121 reviews with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10. The critical consensus states \"Though its subject matter is grim and may make viewers queasy, The Pledge features an excellent, subtle performance by Jack Nicholson.\" [7] The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 33 critics indicating \"Generally favorable reviews.\"[8] | James Berardinelli gave The Pledge three stars, calling it \"clever in the way that it gradually reveals things, but never gives us too much information at one time.\"[9] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and later added it to his \"Great Movies\" list, writing: \"The last third of the movie is where most police stories go on autopilot, with obligatory chases, stalkings and confrontations. That's when The Pledge grows most compelling. Penn and Nicholson take risks with the material and elevate the movie to another, unanticipated, haunting level.\"[10]","m_production":"The film was shot mainly on location in the British Columbia interior.
