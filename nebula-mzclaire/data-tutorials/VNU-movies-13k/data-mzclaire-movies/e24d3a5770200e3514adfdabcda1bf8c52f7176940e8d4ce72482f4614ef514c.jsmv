{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in Wakefield, the film concerns a bitter young Yorkshire coal miner, Frank Machin (Harris). Following a nightclub altercation, in which he takes on the captain of the local rugby league club and punches a couple of the others, he is recruited by the team's manager, who sees profit in his aggressive streak. | Although at first somewhat uncoordinated at league, he impresses the team's owner, Gerald Weaver (Badel), with the spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial. He is signed up to the top team as a loose forward (number 13) and impresses all with his aggressive forward play. He often punches or elbows the opposition players throughout the game. | Off the field, Frank is much less successful. His recently widowed landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond (Roberts), a mother of two young children, lost her husband in an accident at Weaver's engineering firm but received no financial compensation because the death was ruled a suicide. Frank eventually has sexual relations with Margaret, but in her grief she cannot return any affection. She sometimes insults him, referring to him as \"just a great ape,\" and finds his boorish behavior at a smart restaurant off-putting. He is occasionally violent towards her. He leaves and stays at a homeless men's shelter after a row over her late husband. He has another quarrel with Weaver and his predatory wife, whose advances he rejects, much to her chagrin. Intending a reconciliation with Margaret, he finds that she is in a hospital. She is unconscious, having suffered a brain haemorrhage shortly after their split, and she dies without regaining consciousness. In the end he is seen as \"just a great ape on a football field\", vulnerable to the ravages of time and injury.","m_cast":"Richard Harris as Frank Machin | Rachel Roberts as Margaret Hammond | Alan Badel as Gerald Weaver | William Hartnell as 'Dad' Johnson | Colin Blakely as Maurice Braithwaite | Vanda Godsell as Mrs. Anne Weaver | Anne Cunningham as Judith | Jack Watson as Len Miller | Arthur Lowe as Charles Slomer | Harry Markham as Wade | George Sewell as Jeff | Leonard Rossiter as Phillips, Sports writer | Peter Duguid as Doctor | Wallas Eaton as Waiter | Anthony Woodruff as Tom, Head waiter | Tom Clegg as Gower | Ken Traill as the Trainer | Frank Windsor as the Dentist | Ian Thompson as the Batley Town captain","m_reception":null,"m_production":"This was Anderson's first feature film as director, although he had won an Oscar for his short documentary, Thursday's Children (1954), one of many documentaries he had made in the previous decade. The project had first been discussed by the Rank Organisation as a possible project for Joseph Losey, the exiled American film maker, and then was passed to Karel Reisz who, reluctant to direct another film on a Northern England subject so soon after Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), suggested that Lindsay Anderson direct it with himself producing. | Among the supporting cast is William Hartnell, who shortly afterwards began playing the Doctor in Doctor Who. It was his role in This Sporting Life that brought Hartnell to the attention of Doctor Who producer Verity Lambert. The film also features the future Dad's Army star, Arthur Lowe, who appeared in four more films directed by Anderson. | Many of the scenes in This Sporting Life were filmed at Wakefield Trinity's stadium, Belle Vue and at Halifax's stadium Thrum Hall. The scene where Frank (Richard Harris) leaps from a bus to buy a newspaper, then leaps back onto the bus was filmed at the top of Westgate, Wakefield. The location is still instantly recognisable today and has changed very little, apart from the addition of small bars and clubs. The houses filmed for the outdoor scenes in This Sporting Life were in Servia Terrace in Leeds.[citation needed] | Anthony Sloman wrote: | \"By 1963 the British New Wave had beached, and Peter Taylor edited the superb This Sporting Life, the début feature of the cine-literate director Lindsay Anderson. It is a remarkable study of working class angst, with a cutting style like no other British feature before it, an ever-underrated achievement by Taylor...\"[4] | A specific description of the editing says: | From the start, Lindsay Anderson and his editor Peter Taylor show a determination to pursue a flashback-based narrative using bold-cut transitions. ... Cut-transitions link these plangent and understated images together in way that seems to demand that their meanings be understood. It is an important restatement of the way that image-driven filmmaking engages the spectator.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"This Sporting Life by David Storey","m_directed_by":"Lindsay Anderson","m_produced_by":"Karel Reisz","m_screenplay_by":"David Storey","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Richard Harris Rachel Roberts Alan Badel William Hartnell","m_music_by":"Roberto Gerhard","m_cinematography":"Denys Coop","m_edited_by":"Peter Taylor","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Rank Organisation, Janus Films","m_release_dates":"7 February 1963 (London, West End)","m_running_time":"134 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£230,000[1] | This Sporting Life is a 1963 British feature film based on a novel of the same name by David Storey which had won the 1960 Macmillan Fiction Award.
