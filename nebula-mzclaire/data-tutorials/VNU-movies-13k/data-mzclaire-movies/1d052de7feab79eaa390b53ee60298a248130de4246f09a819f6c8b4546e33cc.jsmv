{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Several thousand years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky activated Megatron’s navigational system, which scanned the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own. | In modern Qatar, Blackout attacks and destroys a U.S. military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark. A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert, pursued by Blackout’s drone Scorponok. They fight Scorponok off, aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponok’s stinger, discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor. At The Pentagon, Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack. Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon, Frenzy, hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One. While the hack is thwarted, Frenzy downloads files on Archibald’s glasses, tracking down Sam with Barricade, disguised as a police car. | Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee, but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus explains the details of their situation, revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses, but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but Simmons calls for backup who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, Optimus obtaining the glasses. | The respective groups connected to the Transformers are gathered together at Hoover Dam by Sector Seven’s director Tom Banachek. Inside, the group discover the frozen Megatron and the AllSpark, but Frenzy who smuggled away in Mikaela’s bag, summons the other Decepticons to attack. Bumblebee is released to protect the AllSpark, shrinking it down to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety. Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out. A lengthy battle occurs in Los Angeles, with most of the Decepticons being killed but Megatron murders Jazz. Sam’s attempt to escape with the AllSpark is prevented by Megatron, but Sam rams the AllSpark into his chest, extinguishing his spark. Starscream is the only Decepticon to escape, but Barricade remains on Earth. | Optimus salvages a shard of the AllSpark from Megatron’s body. The U.S. government shuts down Sector Seven, disposing of the dead Decepticons in the Laurentian Abyss, while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth, Optimus sending a transmission into space inviting any surviving Autobots to join them.","m_cast":"Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, the young descendant of an Arctic explorer who stumbles on a big secret which becomes the last hope for Earth. | Tyrese Gibson as Sgt.

Joe film adaptation, but when the United States launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead.[6] Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series.[7] They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence.[6] They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix.[8] DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point of view to engage the audience,[9] while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film.[8] The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.[10] | Steven Spielberg, a fan of the comics and toys,[7] signed on as executive producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons,[11] and featured the Ark spaceship.[12] Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon,[13] were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005.[14] Spielberg suggested that \"a boy and his car\" should be the focus.[15] This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, \"the things that a car represents in the United States\".[16] The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft.[17] The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase.[13] The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon.[18] Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement.[15] The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit).[19] Furman's The Ultimate Guide, published by Dorling Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout production.[19] Prime Directive was used as a fake working title. This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions' first Transformers comic book.[20] | Michael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005,[21] but he dismissed the film as a \"stupid toy movie\".[22] Nonetheless, he wanted to work with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the concept upon visiting Hasbro.[21] Bay considered the first draft \"too kiddie\", so he increased the military's role in the story.[21][23] The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands.[24] Bay based Lennox' struggle to get to the Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film.[21] | Orci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast.[7] Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys.[25] Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked.[26] Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script.[13] Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small.[24] An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.[17] | The filmmakers created the size of each robot with the size of their vehicle mode in mind, supporting the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth.[27] The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why \"aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel\".[28] This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, away from the \"blocky\" Generation 1 Transformers.[29] Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line.[27] The robots also had to look alien, or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man.[30] | A product placement deal with General Motors supplied alternate forms for most of the Autobots, which saved $3 million for the production.[31] GM also provided nearly two hundred cars, destined for destruction in the climactic battle scene.[27] The U.S. Armed Forces provided significant support, enhancing the film's realism: the film features F-22s, F-117s, and V-22 Ospreys, the first time these aircraft were used for a film; soldiers served as extras, and authentic uniforms were provided for the actors.[21] A-10 Thunderbolt IIs and Lockheed AC-130s also appear. Captain Christian Hodge joked that he had to explain to his superiors that the filmmakers wanted to portray most of their aircraft as evil Decepticons: however, he remarked \"people love bad guys\".[27] | To save money for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an eighty-three-day shooting schedule,[21] maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him to work with a crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic.[21][23][31] A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006, and principal photography began on April 22 at Holloman Air Force Base,[32] which stood in for Qatar.[21] To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue as if it were an actual battle.[21][33] | The company also shot at the Hoover Dam and the Pentagon, the first time since the September 11 attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations.[32] The external Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10:00 a.m., with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day.[33] Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built.[33] Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station.[32][33] The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002.[32] Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.[23] | The film has been found to re-use footage from Bay's previous film Pearl Harbor.[34] | Spielberg encouraged Bay to restrict computer-generated imagery to the robots and background elements in the action sequences.[21] Stunts such as Bonecrusher smashing through a bus were done practically, while cameras were placed into the midst of car crashes and explosions to make it look more exciting.[33] Work on the animatics began in April 2005.[11] Bay indicated that three quarters of the film's effects were made by Industrial Light & Magic, while Digital Domain made the rest,[21] including the Arctic discovery of Megatron; Frenzy's severed head; a vending machine mutated by the Allspark, and the Autobots' protoforms.[35] Many of the animators were big Transformers fans and were given free rein to experiment: a scene where Jazz attacks Brawl is a reference to a scene in The Transformers: The Movie where Kup jumps on Blitzwing.[27] | ILM created computer-generated transformations during six months in 2005, looking at every inch of the car models.[37] Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics, but it did not look exciting enough and was changed to be more fluid.[38] Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters' faces, instead going for a \"Rubik's Cube\" style of modeling.[21] He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering beasts.[21][36] One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed.[39] Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful.[21] | Due to the intricate designs of the Transformers, even the simplest motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts;[32] each of Ironhide's guns are made of ten thousand parts.[36] Bumblebee uses a piece below his face-plate as an eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the characters' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten.[39] According to Bay, \"The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement\";[32] that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities.[40] Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to look \"cool\", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing was the key to making the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies.[27] Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.[40] | Composer Steve Jablonsky, who collaborated with Bay on The Island, scored music for the trailers before work began on the film itself. Recording took place in April 2007, at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. The score, including the teaser music, uses six major themes across ninety minutes of music.[41] The Autobots have three themes, one named \"Optimus\" to represent the wisdom and compassion of the Autobot leader, and another played during their arrival on Earth. The Decepticons have a chanted theme which relies on electronics, unlike most of the score. The AllSpark also has its own theme.[42] Hans Zimmer, Jablonsky's mentor, also helped to compose the score.[21]","m_sequel":"The second film, Revenge of the Fallen was released June 24, 2009. The third film, Dark of the Moon was released June 29, 2011. The fourth film, Age of Extinction was released June 27, 2014.

The film, which combines computer animation with live-action, is directed by Michael Bay, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. It is the first installment of the live-action Transformers film series. It stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery, primarily vehicles. The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, Rachael Taylor, John Turturro, and Jon Voight also star while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively. | The film was produced by Don Murphy and Tom DeSanto. They developed the project in 2003, and DeSanto wrote a treatment. Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to write the screenplay. The U.S. Armed Forces and General Motors (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. | Hasbro's promotional campaign for the film included deals with hundreds of companies. Advertising included a viral marketing campaign, coordinated releases of prequel comic books, toys, and books, as well as product placement deals with GM, Burger King, and eBay. | Transformers received mixed to positive reviews from critics and fans, and is the forty-fifth highest-grossing film and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007, grossing approximately $709 million worldwide, with an estimated 46 million tickets sold in the US. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. LaBeouf's performance was praised by Empire, and Cullen's reprisal of Optimus Prime from the 1980s television series was well received by fans. A sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, was released on June 24, 2009. A third film, Dark of the Moon, was released on June 29, 2011, in 3-D and went on to gross over $1 billion. A fourth entry, Age of Extinction, was released on June 27, 2014, which also grossed over $1 billion. A fifth installment, titled Transformers: The Last Knight, is scheduled for a Summer 2017 release.[4] |  | ","m_marketing":"Hasbro's toy line for the film was created over two months in late 2005 and early 2006, in heavy collaboration with the filmmakers.[29] Protoform Optimus Prime and Starscream were released in the United States on May 1, 2007, and the first wave of figures was released on June 2.[29] The line featured characters not in the film, including Arcee.[27] A second wave, titled \"AllSpark Power\", was set for release late 2007, which consisted of repaints and robotic versions of ordinary vehicles in the film.[43] The toys feature \"Automorph Technology\", where moving parts of the toy allow other parts to shift automatically.[44] Merchandise for the film earned Hasbro $480 million in 2007.[45] | Deals were made with 200 companies to promote the film in 70 countries.[46] Michael Bay directed tie-in commercials for General Motors, Panasonic, Burger King and PepsiCo,[47] while props – including the Camaro used for Bumblebee and the AllSpark – were put up for charity sale on eBay.[48] A viral marketing alternate reality game was employed through the Sector 7 website, which presented the film and all previous Transformers toys and media as part of a cover-up operation called \"Hungry Dragon,\" perpetrated by a \"real life\" Sector 7 to hide the existence of genuine Transformers. The site featured several videos presenting \"evidence\" of Transformers on Earth, including a cameo from the original Bumblebee.[49]","m_reference":"^ \"TRANSFORMERS (12A)\".
