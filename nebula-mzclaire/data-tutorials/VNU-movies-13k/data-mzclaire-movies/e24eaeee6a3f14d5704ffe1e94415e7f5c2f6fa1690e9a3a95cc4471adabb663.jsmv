Nearly a decade later another revival film was produced, this time for TV, on ABC. Get Smart, Again! would feature most of the surviving original cast members and ignored the events that took place in The Nude Bomb for continuity purposes. This was followed by a short-lived revival TV series for Fox. A feature film remake of the series was a box office success in 2008; it grossed $230,685,453 worldwide. | The Nude Bomb was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, but it lost to Can't Stop the Music. It is now regarded as something of a cult classic.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Clive Donner","m_produced_by":"Jennings Lang","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Don Adams Sylvia Kristel Dana Elcar Andrea Howard Vittorio Gassman Earl Maynard","m_music_by":"Lalo Schifrin","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Phil Tucker","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"May 9, 1980 (1980-05-09) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":null,"m_language":"English","m_budget":"$15 million","m_box_office":"$14.7 million | The Nude Bomb (also known as The Return of Maxwell Smart or Maxwell Smart and the Nude Bomb) is a 1980 comedy film based on the television series Get Smart.[1] It stars Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86, and was directed by Clive Donner.[1] It was retitled The Return of Maxwell Smart for television.[1] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c \"The Nude Bomb\".
