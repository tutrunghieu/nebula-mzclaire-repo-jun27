{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In a wild prank with her friends, Poppy Moore (Emma Roberts), an affluent Californian teenager, ruins all her father's girlfriend's belongings. When her father angrily arrives, he tells her that he is sending her to a boarding school in England. Arriving at the school, called Abbey Mount, Poppy meets the headmistress Mrs. Kingsley (Natasha Richardson), head girl Harriet Bentley (Georgia King), and her 'big sister' Kate (Kimberley Nixon). She is miserable in her new life as she does not fit in and has no friends as she got Sunday detentions for all her roommates on the first day. | After getting dirty water on her by Harriet's \"maid\", Poppy and Kate become semi-friends. Revealing that the girls' dinosaur cell phones were decoys meant to be confiscated, Kate lets Poppy use hers to call her friend Ruby. When Ruby sees Poppy's message, she is disgusted and goes to sleep with Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy. After Poppy reveals that her mother died several years ago, her roommates decide to help her get expelled. Together they carry out several pranks which gradually brings them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to seduce the headmistress's son, Freddie, who is strictly forbidden to fraternize with any of the girls. She dances with Freddy at the school dance much to Harriet's dismay but Poppy trips and hits her head which leads Freddie to take the concussed girl outside for air where he asks her out on a date. | The next day, Poppy discovers her talent for lacrosse and whips the school's team into shape, getting them into the finals. On the date, Poppy finds herself falling for Freddie. They kiss before Poppy returns to school. In her room, she finds her roommates reading an email supposedly sent by Poppy, stating that she thought all of her new friends were losers. She then finds that Freddie has been given a similar email and is thereafter ignored by her friends. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks down to the cook's room and calls Ruby who accidentally reveals how much she dislikes Poppy and that she is seeing Poppy's boyfriend. Feeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally setting a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs off. A few minutes later, she looks out her window to see a fire and wakes the school. When they find that Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her. After the fire is put out, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to listen to what happened. Just as she realizes that she no longer wants to leave, Poppy goes to the headmistress and confesses. Afterwards, she finds a portrait of her mother in the 1976 Abbey Mount lacrosse team and begins to cry. | While Poppy waits for the Honour Court who will decide if she should be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced that the fire was an accident. During the hearing, Poppy tells her story while her roommates find out that Poppy did not send the emails. Going to the court, they stand up for Poppy and Harriet accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out. The movie is left off at the lacrosse finals. Poppy's father comes to the game and is shocked by Poppy's dramatic change in appearance and how much she looks like her mother who was also captain of the lacrosse team at Abbey Mount. Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse finals and Harriet is expelled. Some months later, Poppy and her friends (including Freddie) are in the process of relaxing in Malibu. Poppy ignores Ruby's phone calls, now fully aware that she was not the friend she thought she was. The film ends as they prepare to jump off the cliff that helped her towards finding herself and making proper friends.","m_cast":"Emma Roberts as Poppy Moore, a spoiled teenager living in Malibu. | Kimberley Nixon as Kate, Poppy's roommate. | Juno Temple as Drippy, Poppy's roommate. | Linzey Cocker as Josie, Poppy's roommate. | Sophie Wu as Kiki, Poppy's roommate. | Natasha Richardson as Mrs. Kingsley, the headmistress of Abbey Mount. | Alex Pettyfer as Freddie Kingsley, Mrs. Kingsley's son and Poppy's love interest/boyfriend. | Georgia King as Harriet Bentley, the head girl of Abbey Mount. | Ruby Thomas as Jane, Harriet's friend/lackey. | Aidan Quinn as Gerry Moore, Poppy's father. | Lexi Ainsworth as Molly Moore, Poppy's sister. | Shelby Young as Ruby, Poppy's friend. | Johnny Pacar as Roddy | Eleanor Turner-Moss as Charlotte, Harriet's friend/lackey. | Shirley Henderson as Matron. | Kelsey Sanders as Skye | Nick Frost as Mr. Christopher, the hairdresser. | Daisy Donovan as Miss Rees-Withers, the sports mistress. | Jason Watkins as Mr. Nellist, the French teacher.","m_reception":"Wild Child was released in the United Kingdom on August 15 taking fifth place at the box office with $2,196,366[clarification needed] from 359 cinemas with an average of $6,118[clarification needed].
