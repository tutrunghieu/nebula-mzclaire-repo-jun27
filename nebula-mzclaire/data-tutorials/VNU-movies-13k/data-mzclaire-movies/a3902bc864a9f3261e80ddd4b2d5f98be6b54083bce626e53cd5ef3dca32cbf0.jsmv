However, superstitious Golden Harvest executives demanded the name change because their two previous films with titles that began with the letter 'M' – Megaforce and Menage A Trois – were both box office flops.[1][2] | The three action star brothers, Yuen, Chan and Hung, are long time best friends and had been Peking Opera School colleagues in their youth.[3] The release of Wheels on Meals came in the midst of their most prolific period working together as a trio. The three men had acted together on Chan's Project A and the first of Hung's original Lucky Stars trilogy, Winners and Sinners in 1983.[4][5] Wheels on Meals was released in 1984, and a year later they were reunited twice more for the Lucky Stars semi-sequels My Lucky Stars and Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars. This was something of a golden period for Hong Kong cinema-goers, as three of the nation's most beloved action stars performed together on screen. | The film also features cameo appearances from fellow Lucky Stars Richard Ng and John Shum as mental patients in the hospital attended by the father of Yuen's character. | Wheels on Meals was the first of two films which paired star Jackie Chan against former professional kickboxing champion Benny Urquidez (the other being the 1988 film Dragons Forever). Their fight in this film is typically regarded as one of the greatest on-screen martial arts fights ever performed. At one point in the final battle between the pair, a spin-kick performed by Urquidez is so quick that the resulting airflow extinguishes a row of candles. This is shown onscreen, with no cuts or trick photography. | Co-star Lola Forner appeared in another Jackie Chan film, Armour of God (1987). | Audio commentator Bey Logan explains why Sammo Hung decided to shoot the film outside of Hong Kong. By the time it was made in 1984, shooting in Hong Kong had become practically impossible – firstly, because the action stars had become so famous that they could not walk through the streets with impunity, and secondly due to the mounting difficulties in obtaining a permit from the government in order to film in Hong Kong. Bruce Lee had paved the way for Hong Kong filmmakers shooting abroad with the 1972 film Way of the Dragon, whose location filming was done in Italy, whereas the interiors had been shot at Golden Harvest studio. | When Hung took his cast and crew to Barcelona, he wanted to strongly establish the locations in Barcelona as real, and to avoid shooting interiors at Golden Harvest. In comparison to Hong Kong, the Spanish authorities were very cooperative in allowing the use of locations for filming, even for car chases and fight scenes.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Samo Hung","m_produced_by":"Raymond Chow","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jackie Chan Sammo Hung Yuen Biao Lola Forner Benny Urquidez Pepe Sancho Herb Edelman Keith Vitali Cheung Chung","m_music_by":"Chris Barbida Tang Siu-lam","m_cinematography":"Arthur Wong Cheung Yiu-tso Francisco Riba","m_edited_by":"Peter Cheung Yiu-chung","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Golden Harvest","m_release_dates":"17 August 1984 (1984-08-17) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes","m_country":"Hong Kong","m_language":"Cantonese | Wheels on Meals (traditional Chinese: 快餐車; simplified Chinese: 快餐车) is a 1984 Hong Kong martial arts comedy film written and directed by Sammo Hung, who also starred in the film.
