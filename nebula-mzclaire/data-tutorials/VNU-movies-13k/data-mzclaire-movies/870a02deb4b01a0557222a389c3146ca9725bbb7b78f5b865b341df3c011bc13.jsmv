Aubrey Smith) and Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton), in Africa on a quest for the legendary elephant burial grounds (and their ivory), are joined by Parker's daughter Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan). Holt, attracted to her, tries somewhat ineffectively to protect her from the jungle's dangers, notably failing to prevent her abduction by the jungle's guardian, the mysterious Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller) and his ape allies. | The experience is terrifying to Jane at first, but as their relationship develops, she finds herself happy: \"Not a bit afraid, not a bit sorry.\" As she returns to her father, her feelings are brought to a test. She wants Tarzan to come with her to London, to be part of her world, but Tarzan turns his back on her and returns to the jungle. Her father tells her that's where Tarzan belongs, she cries, \"No dad, he belongs to me.\" The expedition is captured by a tribe of violent dwarfs. Jane sends Tarzan's ape friend Cheeta (Jiggs) for help, bringing Tarzan to their rescue. During the rescue, Tarzan summons elephants. Jane's father dies and she decides to stay in the jungle with Tarzan. In the end-scene, to the music of Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet, the happy couple appears on a rock below the heavens, Jane holding Cheeta like a baby.","m_cast":"Neil Hamilton as Harry Holt | Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane Parker | C.
