{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Having learned swordsmanship from his father, the young country bumpkin d'Artagnan arrives in Paris with dreams of becoming a king's musketeer. Unaccustomed to the city life, he makes a number of clumsy faux pas. First he finds himself insulted, knocked out and robbed by the Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu, and once in Paris comes into conflict with three musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, each of whom challenges him to a duel for some accidental insult or embarrassment. As the first of these duels is about to begin, Jussac arrives with five additional swordsmen of Cardinal Richelieu's guards. D'Artagnan sides with the musketeers in the ensuing street fight and becomes their ally in opposition to the Cardinal, who wishes to increase his already considerable power over the king, Louis XIII. D'Artagnan also begins an affair with his landlord's wife, Constance Bonacieux, who is dressmaker to the Queen, Anne of Austria. | Meanwhile the Duke of Buckingham, former lover of the Queen, turns up and asks for something in remembrance of her; she gives him a necklace with twelve settings of diamonds, a gift from her husband. From the Queen's treacherous lady in waiting, the Cardinal learns of the rendezvous and suggests to the none-too-bright King to throw a ball in his wife's honor, and request she wear the diamonds he gave her. The Cardinal also sends his agent Milady de Winter to England, who seduces the Duke and steals two of the necklace's diamonds. | Meanwhile, the Queen has confided her troubles in Constance, who asks d'Artagnan to ride to England and get back the diamonds. D'Artagnan and the three musketeers set out, but on the way the Cardinal's men attack them. Only d'Artagnan and his servant make it through to Buckingham, where they discover the loss of two of the diamond settings. The Duke replaces the two settings, and d'Artagnan races back to Paris. Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, wounded but not dead as d'Artagnan had feared, aid the delivery of the complete necklace to the Queen, saving the royal couple from the embarrassment which the Cardinal had plotted. | Captain Tréville eventually inducts d'Artagnan into the Musketeers of the King's Guard.","m_cast":"Michael York as d'Artagnan | Oliver Reed as Athos | Frank Finlay as Porthos / O'Reilly | Richard Chamberlain as Aramis | Jean-Pierre Cassel as King Louis XIII of France | Geraldine Chaplin as Anne of Austria | Charlton Heston as Cardinal Richelieu | Faye Dunaway as Milady de Winter | Christopher Lee as the Count De Rochefort | Simon Ward as the Duke of Buckingham | Raquel Welch as Constance Bonacieux | Spike Milligan as M.

They're interesting to watch, though they are without a great deal of spontaneity.\"[6]","m_production":"According to George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Lester became involved in the project when the producers briefly considered casting The Beatles as the musketeers and Lester had directed two films with the group. The Beatles idea fell by the wayside but Lester stayed. In late 1972 he hired Fraser to write the scripts, saying he wanted to make a four-hour film and cast Richard Chamberlain as Aramis. It was later decided to turn the script into two films.[4]","m_sequel":"Along with \"The Four Musketeers\", released the following year and made with footage originally intended to be part of a much longer film, another sequel was made. | In 1989, much of the cast and crew of the original returned to film The Return of the Musketeers, loosely based on Dumas' 1845 novel Twenty Years After.","m_based_on":"The Three Musketeers  by Alexandre Dumas père","m_directed_by":"Richard Lester[1]","m_produced_by":"Alexander Salkind Ilya Salkind[2] Pierre Spengler","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Oliver Reed Charlton Heston Raquel Welch Faye Dunaway Richard Chamberlain Frank Finlay Michael York Christopher Lee","m_music_by":"Michel Legrand","m_cinematography":"David Watkin","m_edited_by":"John Victor Smith","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"11 December 1973 (1973-12-11) (France) | 29 March 1974 (1974-03-29) (US/UK) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"105 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$10.1 million (US/ Canada)[3] | The Three Musketeers (also known as The Three Musketeers: The Queen's Diamonds) is a 1973 film based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas, père.
