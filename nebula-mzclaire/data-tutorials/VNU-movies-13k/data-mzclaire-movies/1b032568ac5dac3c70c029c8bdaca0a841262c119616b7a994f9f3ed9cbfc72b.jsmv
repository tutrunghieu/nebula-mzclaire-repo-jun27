{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Stage and screen star Tony Hunter, a veteran of musical comedy, is concerned that his career might be in decline. His good friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show that they believe is perfect for his comeback. | Tony signs up, despite misgivings after the pretentious director, Jeffrey Cordova, changes the light comedy into a dark reinterpretation of the Faust legend, with himself as the Devil and Tony as the Faust character. Tony also feels intimidated by the youth, beauty, and classical background of his female co-star, noted ballerina Gabrielle \"Gaby\" Gerard. Unbeknownst to him, she is just as insecure in his presence, awed by his long stardom. | Eventually, it all proves too much for Tony. He walks out, but Gaby speaks with him alone and they work out their differences. They also begin to fall in love, though she already has a commitment to the show's choreographer Paul Byrd. | When the first out-of-town tryout in New Haven proves to be a disaster, Tony persuades Jeffrey to let him convert the production back into what the Martons had originally envisioned. Tony takes charge of the production, taking the show on tour to perfect the new lighthearted musical numbers. Since the original backers have walked out, Tony finances it by selling his personal art collection. Byrd walks out, but Gaby remains. | The revised show proves to be a hit on its Broadway opening. Afterwards, Gaby and Tony confess their love for each other.","m_cast":"Fred Astaire as Tony Hunter | Cyd Charisse as Gabrielle Gerard | Oscar Levant as Lester Marton | Nanette Fabray as Lily Marton | Jack Buchanan as Jeffrey Cordova | James Mitchell as Paul Byrd | Ava Gardner as herself (cameo)","m_reception":"According to MGM records the film earned $2.3 million in the US and Canada and $1,202,000 in other countries, resulting in a loss of $1,185,000.[1]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Vincente Minnelli","m_produced_by":"Arthur Freed | Roger Edens","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Fred Astaire | Cyd Charisse | Oscar Levant | Nanette Fabray | Jack Buchanan","m_music_by":"Arthur Schwartz | Howard Dietz","m_cinematography":"Harry Jackson","m_edited_by":"Albert Akst","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"August 7, 1953 (1953-08-07) (US) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"111 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$2,873,000[1]","m_box_office":"$3,502,000[1] | The Band Wagon is a 1953 musical comedy film that many critics rank, along with Singin' in the Rain, as the finest of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals, although it was only a modest box-office success. It tells the story of an aging musical star who hopes a Broadway show will restart his career. However, the play's director wants to make it a pretentious retelling of Faust, and brings in a prima ballerina who clashes with the star. | The songs were written by the team of composer Arthur Schwartz and lyricist Howard Dietz. (Schwartz was a prolific Hollywood composer who teamed with numerous lyricists over the years, while Dietz, a studio publicist, generally collaborated with Schwartz.) Some of the songs in the film had been created for the original 1931 Broadway musical by Schwartz and Dietz which was also called The Band Wagon, with a book by George S. Kaufman and starring Fred Astaire and his sister Adele. (Fred Astaire also stars in the movie.) The movie's dances and musical numbers were staged by Michael Kidd. | The song \"That's Entertainment!\", which Schwartz and Dietz wrote specifically for the film, was a hit and has become a standard. Another song orchestrated by Conrad Salinger, \"Dancing in the Dark\", is considered part of the Great American Songbook and was from the original Broadway production. Astaire's early number in the film, \"A Shine On Your Shoes\" was actually written for a 1932 Broadway revue with music and lyrics by Dietz and Schwartz called Flying Colors. It had originally been performed by the dancing team of Buddy and Vilma Ebsen. In the movie version of The Band Wagon, the song was reworked to show off Astaire's musical talents. | The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Costume Design, Color, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay. Screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who received the nomination for the screenplay, patterned the film's characters Lester and Lily Marton after themselves, although the fictional characters were a married couple and Comden and Green were not romantically involved. | In 1995, The Band Wagon was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2006, this film ranked #17 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c The Eddie Mannix Ledger, Los Angeles: Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study . | ^ soundtrack | ^ DVD Savant review | ^ Jones, Kenneth. \"Douglas Carter Beane Lovingly Steers 'Band Wagon' to Create 'Dancing in the Dark'\" Playbill, December 23, 2007 | ^ \"'Dancing in the Dark' Old Globe Listing\" theoldglobe.org, accessed October 4, 2015 | ^ Jones, Kenneth. playbill.com article, March 4, 2008, \"'The Band Wagon' Has a New Shine on Its Shoes in 'Dancing in the Dark' March 4 – April 13\" Playbill, March 4, 2008 | ^ Jones, Kenneth. \"That's More Entertainment: Old Globe Gives 'Dancing in the Dark' an Extra Week\" Playbill, March 19, 2008 | ^ [1] Variety, March 16, 2008 | ^ Suskin, Steven. \"That's Entertainment!\" Star-Studded 'The Band Wagon' Brings \"Sweet Music\" to City Center\" Playbill, November 11, 2014 | Diane Stevenson, \"In Praise of Praise\" in the Stanley Cavell special issue, Jeffrey Crouse (ed.), Film International, Issue 22, Vol. 4, No. 4, 2006, pp. 6–13.","m_external_link":"The Band Wagon at the American Film Institute Catalog | The Band Wagon at the Internet Movie Database | The Band Wagon at the TCM Movie Database | The Band Wagon at AllMovie | The Band Wagon at Rotten Tomatoes | Newsweek discussion transcript about The Band Wagon | The Band Wagon (1931) at Internet Broadway Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/The_Band_Wagon_poster.jpg/225px-The_Band_Wagon_poster.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Betty Comden | Adolph Green | Alan Jay Lerner"}
