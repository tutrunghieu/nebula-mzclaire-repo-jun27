{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a dilapidated farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island with their five children Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog Sadie refuses to enter the house and one of the children finds a boarded-up entrance to a cellar. | Paranormal events occur within the first few nights: all of the clocks stop at exactly 3:07 AM and Sadie is found dead in the backyard. One night in bed, Christine feels a tugging on her leg, which is a spirit only she can see. She screams and says that the spirit wants the family dead. Another night, Carolyn hears clapping in the hallway. When she goes to investigate, following the noises, she gets trapped in the basement by the spirit. At the same moment, Andrea and Cindy are attacked by a spirit on top of the wardrobe. | Carolyn decides to contact noted demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who agree to take on the case. The Warrens conduct an initial investigation and conclude that the house may require an exorcism, but they need authorization from the Catholic Church and further evidence before they can proceed. | Ed and Lorraine discover that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba (a relative of Mary Towne Eastey), who sacrificed her week-old child to the devil and killed herself in 1863 after cursing all who would take her land. They find reports of numerous murders and suicides in houses that had since been built on the property. | To gather evidence, Ed and Lorraine place cameras and bells around the house. They see Cindy sleepwalking into Andrea's room, and from the EVPs coming from the radio, they hear a spirit luring Cindy into the wardrobe, where she reveals a secret passage inside. Lorraine enters the passage and falls through the floorboards to the cellar, where she sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had long ago possessed and used to kill her child. | The Perron family decides to take refuge at a hotel while Ed and Lorraine take their evidence to the Church. The Warrens' daughter Judy is attacked in their own home by Bathsheba, though Ed arrives in time to save her. | Carolyn, now possessed by Bathsheba, takes Christine and April back to the house. Ed and Lorraine find Carolyn in the cellar trying to stab Christine. After tying Carolyn to a chair, Ed decides to perform the exorcism himself. Though Carolyn escapes and attempts to kill April, Lorraine is able to distract Carolyn from killing her daughter by reminding her of a special memory she shared with her family, allowing Ed to complete the exorcism, saving Carolyn and April and lifting Bathsheba's curse. | Returning home, Lorraine tells Ed that they had been left a message saying that they had gained approval from the Catholic Church to perform the exorcism. They also have another case to investigate on Long Island. When they leave, the music box that April had found opens and plays music.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Conjuring grossed $137.4 million in North America and $180.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $318 million, against a budget of $20 million.[2] | In North America, the film opened on July 19, 2013, alongside Red 2, Turbo and R.I.P.D., and was projected to gross $30–$35 million from 2,903 theaters in its opening weekend.[54][55][56] The film earned $3.3 million from its Thursday night showings[57] and $17 million on its first day (including Thursday previews), doing slightly better than The Purge a month earlier.[58] The film went on to gross $41.9 million in its opening weekend, landing in first place and breaking The Purge's record as the biggest opening for an original R-rated horror film.[59] For Warner Bros., The Conjuring surpassed the debut weekend of the distributor's big-budget film Pacific Rim, which had opened to $37.3 million the weekend prior.[59] While horror films usually drop at least 50% in their second weekend, The Conjuring only dropped 47%, taking in $22.2 million and placing in second behind new release The Wolverine.[60] After its run in theaters, the film was officially named a box office hit, grossing over fifteen times its production budget with a worldwide total of $318 million.[2] Calculating in all production and promotional expenses, Deadline.com estimated that the film made a total profit of $161.7 million.[61] | Outside North America, the film had a total gross of $180.6 million from all its overseas markets.[2] In Australia, it grossed $1.8 million in its debut weekend, placing third at the box office behind The Heat and This Is the End.[62] Its total gross in Australia was $8.2 million.[63] In the United Kingdom, the film opened on August 6 alongside The Smurfs 2, making £2.6 million ($3.3 million) in its opening weekend,[64] and grossing $16.2 million in total there.[63] It had its biggest international gross in Mexico, opening in first place on August 23, where the film made $18.9 million overall.[63] | The Conjuring received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 86% approval rating, based on 201 reviews, with a rating average of 7.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Well-crafted and gleefully creepy, The Conjuring ratchets up dread through a series of effective old-school scares.\"[65] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[66] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an \"A-\" grade on a scale of A to F.[67] | In her review following the Los Angeles Film Festival, Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said: \"With its minimal use of digital effects, its strong, sympathetic performances and ace design work, the pic harks back in themes and methods to The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror, not quite attaining the poignancy and depth of the former but far exceeding the latter in sheer cinematic beauty.\"[35] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, calling the film \"a sensationally entertaining old-school freakout and one of the smartest, most viscerally effective thrillers in recent memory.\"[68] Additionally, Alonso Duralde of TheWrap also praised the effectiveness of the film, explaining that it \"doesn't try to reinvent the tropes of horror movies, whether it's ghosts or demons or exorcisms, but Fred Astaire didn't invent tap-dancing, either.\"[69] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, citing the effectiveness of \"mood and sound effects for shocks that never feel cheap.\"[70] | However, some critics reacted negatively to the film's similarities with films such as The Exorcist and Poltergeist.[71][72] Indiewire's Eric Kohn explained that: \"The Warrens may know how to handle demonic possessions, but The Conjuring suffers from a different invading force: the ghosts of familiarity.\"[73] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon said the film provided \"all the scream-inducing shocks you could want, right on schedule,\" but thought the central concept – that the innocent women accused and executed in the Salem witch trials \"actually were witches, who slaughtered children and pledged their love to Satan and everything!\" – was \"reprehensible and inexcusable bullshit.\"[74]","m_production":"Development began over 20 years prior when Ed Warren played a tape of Lorraine's original interview with Carolyn Perron for producer Tony DeRosa-Grund.[6] DeRosa-Grund made a recording of Warren playing back the tape and of their subsequent discussion. At the end of the tape, Warren said to DeRosa-Grund: \"If we can't make this into a film I don't know what we can.\" DeRosa-Grund then described his vision of the film for Ed.[7] | DeRosa-Grund wrote the original treatment and titled the project The Conjuring.[8] For nearly 14 years, he tried to get the movie made without any success. He landed a deal to make the movie at Gold Circle Films, the production company behind The Haunting in Connecticut, but a contract could not be finalized and the deal was dropped.[9] | DeRosa-Grund allied with producer Peter Safran, and sibling writers Chad and Carey Hayes were brought on board to refine the script.[8] Using DeRosa-Grund's treatment and the Ed Warren tape, the Hayes brothers changed the story's point of view from the Perron family to the Warrens'. The brothers interviewed Lorraine Warren many times over the phone to clarify details.[10] By mid-2009, the property became the subject of a six-studio bidding war that landed the film at Summit Entertainment.[11] However, DeRosa-Grund and Summit could not conclude the transaction and the film went into turnaround. DeRosa-Grund reconnected with New Line Cinema, who had lost in the original bidding war but who ultimately picked up the film. On November 11, 2009, a deal was made between New Line and DeRosa-Grund's Evergreen Media Group.[12] | \"When Insidious came out and was successful the story about the Warrens came to me and I was like, \"Oh, my gosh, this is really cool.\" [...] But I didn't just want to make another ghost story or another supernatural film. One thing I had never explored was the chance to tell a story that's based on real-life characters, real-life people. So those were the things that led me to The Conjuring.\" | Pre-production began in early 2011, with reports surfacing in early June that James Wan was in talks to direct the film.[14] This was later confirmed by Warner Bros., which also stated that the film would be loosely based on real-life events surrounding Ed and Lorraine Warren. In January 2012, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson were cast to star in the film.[15] That month, Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor were also confirmed for roles in the film, which at that time was developing under the working title of The Untitled Warren Files Project.[16] The film's title was temporarily changed to The Warren Files based on a suggestion by Wan, but was later reverted to The Conjuring prior to the commencement of the film's marketing campaign.[17][18] | In preparation for their roles, Farmiga and Wilson traveled to Connecticut to spend time with Lorraine Warren,[19] who also visited the set during production.[20] Over the course of spending three days at the Warren home, both actors took in information that could not otherwise be achieved from secondary research. \"I just wanted to absorb her essence. I wanted to see the details, she has such mad style. I just wanted to see – the way she communicates with her hands, these gestures, her smile, how she moves through space,\" said Farmiga on her observations of Warren.[21] | Principal photography began in late February 2012.[22] Lasting for 38 days,[23] shooting took place primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios as well as other locations in and around Wilmington, North Carolina.[24] Filming also took place at the University of North Carolina Wilmington in March 2012 while the campus was on its spring break.[25] Diana Pasulka, professor of Religious Studies at UNC-Wilmington, was the chief religious consultant for the project.[26] After wrapping up in Wilmington on April 20, the film concluded its principal photography on April 26, 2012.[27] All scenes were shot in chronological order.[19] | The film was in post-production in August of the same year.[28] Around 20 to 30 minutes of footage was removed from the first cut of the film, which initially ran at about two hours in duration.[29] After positive test screenings, the final edit of the film was locked in December 2012 and awaited its summer release.[30]","m_sequel":"In June 2013, it was reported that New Line Cinema was already developing a sequel.[88] Both Farmiga and Wilson are signed on to reprise their roles for an additional film.[89] The Conjuring 2 was scheduled to be released on October 23, 2015,[90] but in October 2014, Warner Bros. moved the film's release date to an unspecified 2016 release date.[91] On October 21, it was announced that James Wan would return to direct the sequel.[92] On November 11, 2014, the film was set for a June 10, 2016 release.[93] The sequel was later re-written by David Leslie Johnson, with a script from Eric Heisserer.[94] The film will deal with the Enfield Poltergeist case, which occurred in London from 1977 to 1979.[95] Principal photography began in September 2015 in Los Angeles, and concluded in December 2015 in London.[96] | On a potential third film, director James Wan stated, \"There could be many more [Conjuring] movies because the Warrens have so many stories.\" Screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes have also expressed interest in working on a story for another sequel.[97] However, Wan stated that he may be unable to direct the film due to his commitments to other projects.[98] He stated to Collider.com, \"Assuming we are lucky enough to have a third chapter, there are other filmmakers that I would love to sort of continue on the Conjuring world, if we are lucky enough.\"[99] Wan has also stated that, if a third film was to be made, it would ideally take place in the 1980s.[100]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Wan","m_produced_by":"Tony DeRosa-Grund | Peter Safran | Rob Cowan","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Vera Farmiga | Patrick Wilson | Ron Livingston | Lili Taylor","m_music_by":"Joseph Bishara","m_cinematography":"John R.
