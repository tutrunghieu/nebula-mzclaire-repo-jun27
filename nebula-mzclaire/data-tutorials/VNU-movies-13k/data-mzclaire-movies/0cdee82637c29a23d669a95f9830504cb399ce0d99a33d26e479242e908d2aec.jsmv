{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During the Second Sudanese Civil War, siblings Mamere, Paul, Jeremiah, Theo, Daniel and Abital escape after their families and village are massacred. After numerous days of walking in the wilderness, they join a group of refugees but leave after they are caught and many people are killed. After sleeping in the grassland, Theo awakens and is captured by soldiers while his siblings hide in the grass. The group eventually arrives at a Sudanese refugee camp in Nairobi, Kenya, where Daniel succumbs to disease and dies. Thirteen years later, among the thousands in the camp, the siblings win a lottery for relocation to the United States. | At arrival in New York City, Abital is unexpectedly told that she is to leave to Boston, where a family awaits. As their sister tearfully leaves, Jeremiah, Mamere and Paul board the flight to Kansas City, where they meet Carrie Davis, a brash employment counselor, who helps them find jobs. Jeremiah works at a grocery store and teaches Sunday school at a local church. Paul works at a factory and makes friends with his co-workers, as well as exposure to drugs. Mamere takes two jobs as a store clerk and a security guard to pay for schooling, as he aspires to become a medical doctor. Mamere eventually convinces Carrie to help them bring back Abital; on Christmas Eve, Carrie arrives at their home with Abital and the Lost Boys of Sudan celebrate their birthday on January 1. | Abital receives a letter stating that someone entered the refugee camp in Kenya searching for the group. Thinking it is Theo, Mamere travels to Nairobi and searches the refugee camp after they tell him that Theo is not registered. After meeting James, an old friend, he is reunited with Theo the next day. Mamere tries to get immigration papers to multiple embassies and fails. At the airport, Mamere reveals to Theo that he could not get him a passport and instead gives Theo his own passport.
