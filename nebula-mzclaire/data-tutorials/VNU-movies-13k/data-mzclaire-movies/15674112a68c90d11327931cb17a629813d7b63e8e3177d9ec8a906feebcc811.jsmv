{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On Saturday, April 5, 1941, one day before the Nazi invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a colourful group of random passengers on a country road deep in the heart of Serbia board a dilapidated Krstić & Son bus, headed for the capital Belgrade: two Gypsy musicians, a World War I veteran, a Germanophile, a budding singer, a sickly looking man, and a hunter with a rifle. The bus is owned by Krstić Sr., and driven by his impressionable son Miško. | Along the way, they are joined by a priest and a pair of young newlyweds who are on their way to the seaside for their honeymoon, and are faced with numerous difficulties: a flat tire, a shaky bridge, a farmer who's ploughed over the road, a funeral, two feuding families, Krstić Jr.'s recruitment into the army, and a lost wallet. All these slow the bus down and expose rifts among the travelers. | During the early morning of Sunday, April 6, amid rumours of war, they finally reach Belgrade only to be caught in the middle of the Luftwaffe raid (Operation Punishment). The only surviving passengers are the two Gypsy musicians who sing the film's theme song before the end.","m_cast":"Pavle Vujisić — Conductor | Dragan Nikolić — Singer | Danilo \"Bata\" Stojković — Germanophile | Aleksandar Berček — Miško Krstić | Neda Arnerić — Bride | Mića Tomić — Aleksa Simić | Taško Načić — Hunter | Boro Stjepanović — Consumptive | Slavko Štimac — Bridegroom | Miodrag Kostić — 1st Musician | Nenad Kostić — 2nd Musician | Bora Todorović — Mourner | Slobodan Aligrudić — Lieutenant | Petar Lupa — Priest | Stanojlo Milinković — Plowman | Ljubomir Ćipranić — Corporal | Milovan Tasić — Plowman's son","m_reception":"The movie became an instant classic all over SFR Yugoslavia immediately upon its release. To this day, it endures as one of the most quotable movies ever to come out of the Balkans. Different scenes and dialogues are almost a part of general knowledge, with many entering public vernacular.[2] | The film earned the special jury award at the 1981 Montréal World Film Festival. | In 1996, members of the Yugoslavian Board of the Academy of Film Art and Science (AFUN) voted this movie as the best Serbian movie made in the 1947-1995 period.[9]","m_production":"Centar Film, the state-owned production house, wanted to make Dušan Kovačević's script into a movie since 1978. | Reportedly, Goran Paskaljević was their first choice to direct the movie. He was supposed to shoot the Kovačević script as a contemporary-themed 50-minute TV movie set in the late 1970s on a public transport bus with the central character being an old man (played by Mija Aleksić) who is headed to visit his son in the army. However, Paskaljević decided to leave the project and shoot the feature film Zemaljski dani teku instead. The job then went to 33-year-old Slobodan Šijan who had never shot a feature film up to that point.[6] | The movie was made on a budget of US$130,000 with 21 shooting days.[7] The filming began on 3 April 1980.[6] It was shot almost entirely in Deliblatska Peščara. | The final bombing scene was originally meant to include wild animals from the bombed Belgrade Zoo roaming through the city's downtown, which indeed happened during actual 6 April 1941 Luftwaffe air-raids; in fact, an old newspaper article documenting this bizarre occurrence served as inspiration for the author Dušan Kovačević to include it in the film. However, at the time of movie's filming in 1980, Tito died, which resulted in the extended mourning period that effectively canceled all entertainment activities in the country - including the Italian circus tour that was meant to provide the animals for the scene. Since working with untrained zoo animals was deemed too dangerous, the film-makers reluctantly had to abandon the idea at the time. However, the idea was used in the opening scene of Underground (1995), some 15 years later.[citation needed] | In 2004 the film was turned into a ballet by the National Theatre in Belgrade.[8] The music is again by Vojislav Kostić and the choreography is made by Staša Zurovac.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Slobodan Šijan","m_produced_by":"Milan Zmukić","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Pavle Vujisić Dragan Nikolić Bata Stojković Aleksandar Berček Mića Tomić Taško Načić Boro Stjepanović Slavko Štimac Neda Arnerić","m_music_by":"Vojislav Kostić","m_cinematography":"Božidar Nikolić","m_edited_by":"Ljiljana Vukobratović","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Centar Film (Yugoslavia) International Home Cinema (USA)","m_release_dates":"23 October 1980[2]","m_running_time":"87 minutes[3]","m_country":"Yugoslavia","m_language":"Serbo-Croatian","m_budget":"DEM180,000[4] | Who's Singin' Over There?
