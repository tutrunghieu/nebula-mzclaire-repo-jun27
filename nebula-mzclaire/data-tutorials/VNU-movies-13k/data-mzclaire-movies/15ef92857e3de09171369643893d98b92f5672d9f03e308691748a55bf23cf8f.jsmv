It previously was on the list of top 50 highest grossing films at #3, just three months after it's release.[6] The film received mixed-to-positive reviews upon release. Vincent Canby of the New York Times wrote \"Uptown Saturday Night is essentially a put-on, but it's so full of good humor and, when the humor goes flat, of such high spirits that it reduces movie criticism to the status of a most nonessential craft\". Paul D. Zimmermann of Newsweek magazine writes \"Poitier is not an inventive comic talent - he is erratic behind the camera and amiable but not funny in front of it. When the funny set pieces stop, the film sputters - but not before delivering a carnival of fine comic characters. From Variety: \"Actor Poitier also dampens the proceedings with a bland, comically mistimed performance that suffers greatly in comparison to Cosby's fast-living rendition of his carefree buddy.\" Walter Burrell of Essence magazine stated \"one walks away a bit dissatisfied...One is left with the feeling these great talents could have sued a vehicle more suite to their abilities.\"[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"Although indirect, the sequels are Let's Do It Again (1975), and A Piece of the Action (1977). They also garnered mixed reviews from critics, partly due to the fall of the blaxploitation era. | Let's Do It Again (1975) | Written by Richard Wesley and directed by Sidney Poitier. The first sequel to Uptown Saturday Night features Poitier and Cosby again on the same screen as Clyde Williams (Poitier) and Billy Foster (Cosby). Many members of the previous film return and play different roles, including Lee Chamberlin and Calvin Lockhart. The film relies primarily on slapstick comedy, compared to Uptown Saturday Night which had verbal wit comedy.[9] The film was met with negative reviews. Stephen Klain of the Independent Film Journal wrote \"As he did in the previous film, Poitier had given himself relatively little to do as an actor, preferring to let the camera linger on Cosby, who lets all stops out.\" Richard Eder of The New York Times stated \"The movie's main strength is Bill Cosby, who looks like a starved sheep in wolf's clothing, as is shifty and woebegone at the same time.\" In spite of reviews, it grossed $11,800,800 in North America, surpassing Uptown Saturday Night in revenue.[10] | A Piece of the Action (1977) | Written by Charlies Blackwill and directed by Sidney Poitier. The third of a trilogy of action films directed by Poitier, he and Bill Cosby return as Manny Durrell and Dave Anderson. Like it's predecessor, it primarily uses slapstick comedy. It gained fairly positive reviews from critics. David Ansen of Newsweek magazine wrote \"Corny and hip, cynical and sentimental, formulaic and funky, A Piece of the Action may have a medicinal intent, but it goes down like ice cream soda.\" It grossed $6,700,000 domestically.","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Sidney Poitier","m_produced_by":"Melville Tucker","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sidney Poitier Bill Cosby Harry Belafonte","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Pembroke J.
