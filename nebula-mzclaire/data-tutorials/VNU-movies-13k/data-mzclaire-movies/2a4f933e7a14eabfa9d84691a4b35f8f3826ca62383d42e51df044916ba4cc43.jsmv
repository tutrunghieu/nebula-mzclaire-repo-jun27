{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Spain 1519, two con artists, Tulio and Miguel, win a map to the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado, in a rigged gambling match. After their con is discovered, the two evade capture and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by Hernán Cortés to the New World. During the trip, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but manage to break free and take a rowboat with the help of Cortés' horse, Altivo. | Later, they land on an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, and Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a large waterfall. Believing it to be a dead end. Until they encounter a native woman being chased by guards, when the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, escort them to a secret entrance behind the falls, along with the woman, and into a city truly made of gold, El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kind-hearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. Tzekel-Kan, seeking to seize the city from Tannabok, insist the two, mistaken as gods, demonstrate their powers. Tulio and Miguel bicker between themselves, while a nearby volcano begins to erupt. When Tulio yells at Miguel to stop pestering him, the volcano suddenly stops erupting, and the citizens take this as proof of their godhood. Celebrations are held, and are given luxurious quarters to stay, along with charge of the woman, Chel. Chel is aware the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapproves Tzekel-Kan in sacrificing a civilian as the gods' ritual. | Tulio convinces Tannabok to build them a vessel that will allow them to leave the city with all the gifts they've been given, which will take three days. Miguel explores the city, allowing Chel to get romantically close to Tulio. Miguel comes to appreciate the peaceful life the citizens seem to enjoy, and joins in with some of their activities. When Tzekel-Kan sees Miguel playing a ball game with children, he insists that the gods demonstrate their prowess against the city's best players in the same game. Tulio and Miguel are far outmatched, but Chel is able to substitute the ball with an armadillo named Bibo, allowing them to win; the two spare the ritual of sacrificing the other team, much to the crowd's approval. During the match, Tzekel-Kan sees Miguel received a small cut and realizes the two are not gods, because gods don't bleed. Tzekel-Kan conjures a giant stone jaguar to chase them through the city. As Tulio and Miguel argue over their differences they manage to outwit the jaguar, causing both it and Tzekel-Kan to fall into a giant whirlpool, thought to be the entrance to Xibalba, the spirit world. When Tzekel-Kan comes to, he finds himself facing Cortés and his men; thinking Cortés is a god he offers to lead them to El Dorado. | With the boat completed, Miguel states his intention to stay in the city. Tulio and Chel board the boat, loaded with the gifts, when they see smoke on the horizon and realize Cortés is close. Tulio concocts a plan to use the boat to ram pillars under the waterfall to cave-in the main entrance to El Dorado, but requires the citizens to pull over a statue in the boat's wake to give it enough speed to ram the pillars. As the statue starts to fall too quickly, Tulio has difficulty in preparing the boat's sails. Miguel, giving up on staying in the city, rides Altivo then jumps onto the boat to unfurl the sails, assuring the boat clears the statue in time. Tulio's plan works, though the boat and their gifts are lost. Tulio, Miguel, Chel, and Altivo end up near the totem and hide as Cortés' men and Tzekel-Kan arrive. When Tzekel-Kan finds the entrance blocked, Cortés accuses him a liar and taken prisoner as they leave. Tulio and Miguel, though disappointed they lost their treasure, takes off in a different direction for a new adventure with Chel, unaware that Altivo still wears the golden horseshoes he was outfitted with in the city.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Under the working title El Dorado: City of Gold,[3][4] the film was originally scheduled for release in fall of 1999.[5] During production, the filmmakers drew much inspiration for the characters of Miguel and Tulio from those of the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road to... films. \"The buddy relationship [between the duo] is the very heart of the story. They need each other because they're both pretty inept. They're opposites — Tulio is the schemer and Miguel is the dreamer. Their camaraderie adds to the adventure; you almost don't need to know where they're going or what they're after, because the fun is in the journey\", remarked one of the film's producers, Bonne Radford. Unusually for an animated film, Kline and Branagh recorded their lines in the same studio room together, in order for the two to achieve more realistic chemistry. This resulted in a good deal of improvised dialogue, some of which ended up in the film.[6] However, it also made work more difficult for the audio team.[citation needed] | In late 1996, Tim Rice and Elton John were asked to compose seven songs, which they immediately worked on. In February 1999, before the release of Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, it was announced that ten songs had been composed for El Dorado. It was also announced that the release date had been pushed to March 2000.[3] | The creation of the film was a challenge for the studio because DreamWorks Animation had devoted most of its creative efforts to its previous animated film, The Prince of Egypt.[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"El Dorado","m_directed_by":"Don Paul | Eric \"Bibo\" Bergeron","m_produced_by":"Brook Breton | Bonne Radford","m_screenplay_by":"Ted Elliott | Terry Rossio","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Elton John","m_music_by":"Hans Zimmer | John Powell","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"John Carnochan | Dan Molina | Vicki Hiatt | Lynne Sutherland","m_production_company":"DreamWorks Animation","m_distributed_by":"DreamWorks Pictures1","m_release_dates":"March 31, 2000 (2000-03-31) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"89 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$95 million","m_box_office":"$76.4 million | The Road to El Dorado is a 2000 American animated adventure buddy comedy film directed by Eric \"Bibo\" Bergeron and Don Paul, with additional sequences by Will Finn and David Silverman, starring Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, and Rosie Pérez, and produced by DreamWorks Animation.

However, when it is discovered that they are using loaded dice they attempt to escape, only to end up as stowaways on Hernán Cortés' fleet to conquer Mexico. They are discovered, but manage to escape in a boat with Cortés' prize war horse and eventually discover the hidden city of El Dorado, where they are mistaken for gods. | The Road to El Dorado received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $76.4 million worldwide on a $95 million budget, making it DreamWorks Animation's only box office bomb.
