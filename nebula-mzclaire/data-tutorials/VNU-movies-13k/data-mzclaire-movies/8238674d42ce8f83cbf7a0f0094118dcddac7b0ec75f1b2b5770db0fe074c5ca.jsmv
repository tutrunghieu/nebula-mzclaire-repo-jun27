{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Zohan Dvir (Adam Sandler) is a kind-hearted superhuman Israeli counter-terrorist and the finest and most respected soldier in the Israel Defense Forces. However, Zohan has become both disgusted and disenchanted by the constant fighting, secretly dreaming of moving to the USA and becoming a hairdresser. This reaches a breaking point when a barbecue he hosts is interrupted by the IDF sending Zohan on a mission to stop a Palestinian terrorist group being led by his personal arch-enemy, Fatoush \"the Phantom\" Hakbarah (John Turturro), another superhuman. Despite being upset over his ruined party, Zohan sees it as his long-awaited chance to desert the IDF and move to America. During the pursuit he fakes his own death and smuggles himself onto a flight to New York City, cutting his own hair and taking the alias \"Scrappy Coco\" (the names of two dogs he shared the flight with) while claiming that he is \"Half Australian, Half Mount Everest.\" Meanwhile, the Phantom becomes rich and famous for supposedly killing Zohan and starts his own fast-food business, \"Muchentuchen\". | Initially unsuccessful in getting hired at several salons, Zohan's military expertise earns him a new friend, Michael (Nick Swardson), who gives him a place to stay. However, Michael starts to freak out when he finds Zohan having sex with his mother, Gail (Lainie Kazan). Zohan encounters a fellow Israeli named Oori (Ido Mosseri) at a disco; he recognizes Zohan but agrees to keep his identity a secret. Oori takes him to a block in lower Manhattan filled with Middle Eastern Americans, who are split between a Palestinian side and an Israeli side of the street. Zohan attempts to land a job in a struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui). After first only allowing Zohan to sweep floors for free, she eventually allows him to be a stylist after he pleases a senior lady with a satisfactory haircut and back room sexual service. Zohan's reputation spreads rapidly among the elderly women of lower Manhattan. Dalia's business booms, upsetting Grant Walbridge (Michael Buffer), a corporate magnate who has been trying to force out all the local tenants on the block so that he can build a rollercoaster mall. | Zohan is identified by a Palestinian cab driver named Salim (Rob Schneider), who bears a grudge against Zohan for having taken his goat away. Salim convinces his friends to help him kill Zohan but, after a failed bomb attempt, he is forced to contact Phantom. Salim attempts to blackmail Phantom, but he ends up getting the stiff end of the deal as he convinces Phantom to visit New York to find Zohan. Meanwhile, Zohan realizes that he has fallen in love with Dalia, and comes clean to Michael and his mother about his true identity, before meeting Dalia. Dalia rejects Zohan after he reveals he was formerly an Israeli counter-terrorist operative. Zohan decides to leave Dalia and confront Phantom in a championship Hacky Sack game sponsored by Walbridge. Zohan's fight is cut short with sudden news of the Middle Eastern block being attacked, and he quickly leaves. | Zohan arrives and calms the Israelis and Palestinians, who each blame the other for the violence, while making peace with Salim. Phantom then appears and confronts Zohan, but Zohan refuses to fight. Dalia appears, revealing that she is Phantom's sister, and convinces her brother to cooperate with Zohan against the arsonists, revealed to be white racist rednecks hired by Walbridge to instigate an inter-ethnic riot so he can get his new mall in the aftermath. As Zohan and Phantom work to save the block (by singing \"The Sound\", a sound so loud, it destroys many shops, blows the manhole cover, and even blows up the breasts of Walbridge's wife), the Phantom admits that he always wanted to be a shoe salesman rather than a terrorist. Although the rednecks are defeated and Walbridge sent to jail, Phantom keeps singing The Sound and accidentally destroys all of the shops on the block. However, with the Israelis and the Palestinians united, the block is transformed into a collectively owned mall called the Peace and Brotherhood Fire Insurance Mall. Oori re-opens his \"Going out of Business\" electronics store, Phantom opens a shoe store in the mall called Fatoush's Kickin' Shoes, Salim gets back his goat, which he gives children rides on next to Trendy Toddler, and Zohan and Dalia open a joint beauty parlor called Dalohan, Zohan having married Dalia. Zohan's parents show up approving his new life before his father asks that he cut his hair, which he happily does.","m_cast":"Adam Sandler as Zohan Dvir/Scrappy Coco | Emmanuelle Chriqui as Dalia Hakbarah | Rob Schneider as Salim the taxi driver | John Turturro as Fatoush \"Phantom\" Hakbarah | Nick Swardson as Michael Klayman | Lainie Kazan as Gail Klayman | Ido Mosseri as Oori | Daoud Heidami as Nasi | John Paul DeJoria as Paul Mitchell | Michael Buffer as Grant Walbridge | Dave Matthews as James T.

As of September 7, 2008[update], it reached a domestic tally of $100,018,837, continuing Sandler's streak of making over $100 million at the domestic box office. The film grossed $202,910,994 worldwide.[2]","m_production":"Sandler, Robert Smigel, and Judd Apatow wrote the first draft of the script in 2000, but the movie was delayed after the events of 9/11 because those involved felt that the subject would be too sensitive. Apatow left the project after the first draft in 2000 to work on his show Undeclared and had, for the most part, not been involved in the project since.[4] The film is based in part on the story of Nezi Arbib, an Israeli soldier who after his service moved to southern California and opened a hair salon. Sandler trained with Arbib and his brothers, also former soldiers, for two weeks to learn hairstyling and work with clients.[5] The movie features elements that first appeared in the SNL sketches \"Sabra Shopping Network\" and \"Sabra Price Is Right,\" which starred Tom Hanks and were written by Robert Smigel. They originated lines such as 'Sony guts' and 'Disco, Disco, good, good'. The first sketch is also notable for featuring one of Adam Sandler's first (uncredited) television appearances while the second featured Sandler, Schneider, Smigel and Kevin Nealon in supporting parts. Robert Smigel worked with Sandler on past films including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Little Nicky, but this was the first time in which he was credited for helping to write the script. He was also an executive producer on the film which allowed him to further contribute to the movie's comedic sensilbility. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz commented that the movie was known in Hollywood circles as \"the Israeli movie.\" Haaretz also noted that while \"Israeli actors were rushing to audition [for the movie], the response among Arab actors was far from enthusiastic.[6] (Emmanuelle Chriqui, who played Zohan's Palestinian love interest, was raised as an Orthodox Jew.[7]) The film poked fun at the popularity of hummus in Israeli culture. In the movie, characters used it to brush their teeth and as a method to douse the flames of a fire,[8][9] as well as a hair care product.[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Dennis Dugan","m_produced_by":"Adam Sandler | Jack Giarraputo | Robert Smigel","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Adam Sandler | John Turturro | Emmanuelle Chriqui | Nick Swardson | Lainie Kazan | Rob Schneider","m_music_by":"Rupert Gregson-Williams","m_cinematography":"Michael Barrett","m_edited_by":"Tom Costain","m_production_company":"Relativity Media Happy Madison Productions","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"June 6, 2008 (2008-06-06) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"112 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$90 million","m_box_office":"$201.1 million[2] | You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a 2008 American action comedy film directed by Dennis Dugan and produced by Adam Sandler, who also starred in the film.
