{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jane Falbury (Judy Garland) is a farm owner whose actress sister Abigail (Gloria DeHaven) arrives at the family farm with her theater troupe. They need a place to rehearse, and Jane and her housekeeper Esme (Marjorie Main) reluctantly agree to let them use their barn. The actors and actresses, including the director Joe Ross (Gene Kelly), repay her hospitality by doing chores around the farm. Although Joe is engaged to Abigail, he begins to fall in love with Jane after Abigail leaves him in an angry fit. Similarly, although Jane is engaged to Orville (Eddie Bracken), she falls in love with Joe.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"According to MGM's records, during the film's initial release it earned $2,498,000 in the US and Canada and $859,000 overseas, resulting in a small $80,000 loss to the studio.[1]","m_production":"Although Garland and Kelly were the stars originally announced by MGM in 1948 to appear in Summer Stock, in February 1949 the studio announced that Garland would be replaced by June Allyson. Garland was suspended in May 1949, during the filming of Annie Get Your Gun, and spent three months in a hospital in Boston being treated for drug dependency. Betty Hutton replaced her on that film, but Garland was reinstated to the lead in Summer Stock, which was her first film following the suspension.[8] Still, the filming of the movie was sometimes a struggle for Garland, who was facing many pressures in her personal life, aside from her heavy reliance on prescription medication.[9][10] | Kelly himself was not the first choice for the role: the producer, Joe Pasternak, originally wanted Mickey Rooney for the part, but was prevailed on to go with Kelly because Rooney was no longer the box office draw he had once been. Busby Berkeley was originally slated to direct the film, but was replaced by Charles Walters before production began. Both Kelly and Walters worked on the film as a favor to Garland, whose career needed a boost at the time. Later, after filming had begun, Pasternak asked Mayer if he should abandon the film because of Garland's erratic behavior – for example, she was supposed to appear in the \"Heavenly Music\" number to sing and dance with Kelly and Phil Silvers, but never showed up for the shoot – but studio head Louis B. Mayer insisted that Garland be given another chance,[8] saying \"Judy Garland has made this studio a fortune in the good days, and the least we can do is to give her one more chance. If you stop production now, it'll finish her.\"[10] | Dance director Nick Castle did not choreograph \"You Wonderful You,\" \"All for You\" and \"Portland Fancy\" – these were done by Gene Kelly – but did do \"Dig-Dig-Dig Dig for Your Dinner\" and other numbers. He also did not shoot \"Get Happy,\" which was filmed three months after the rest of the film; instead it was shot by director Walters. In the interval, Garland had been treated by a hypnotist for weight loss and took off 15-20 pounds; she appears considerably thinner in the number.[3][8][9][10] | Garland finished filming the movie and embarked on a long promised vacation from the studio. Soon, however, she was called back to star with Fred Astaire and Peter Lawford in the film Royal Wedding, replacing June Allyson, who was pregnant. Once again, Garland struggled to perform in the face of exhaustion and overwork. She was fired from the film, and her contract with MGM was terminated through mutual agreement.[8][11][12] | Overall, Summer Stock took six months to film, and was a box-office success.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Charles Walters","m_produced_by":"Joe Pasternak","m_screenplay_by":"Sy Gomberg George Wells","m_story_by":"Sy Gomberg","m_starring":"Judy Garland Gene Kelly","m_music_by":"Score: Conrad Salinger (uncredited) Songs-Music: Harry Warren Harold Arlen Songs-Lyrics: Mack Gordon Jack Brooks Saul Chaplin Ted Koehler","m_cinematography":"Robert Planck","m_edited_by":"Albert Akst","m_production_company":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"August 31, 1950 (1950-08-31) (US) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"109 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$2,025,000[1]","m_box_office":"$3,357,000[1] | Summer Stock (UK title: If You Feel Like Singing) is a 1950 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film.
