{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with Max, a lonely nine-year-old boy[6] with an active imagination whose parents are divorced, wearing a wolf costume and chasing his dog. His older sister, Claire, does nothing when her friends crush Max's snow fort (with him inside) during a snowball fight. Out of frustration, Max messes up her bedroom and destroys a frame that he had made for her. At school, Max's teacher teaches him and his classmates about the eventual death of the sun. Later on, his mother, Connie, invites her boyfriend Adrian to dinner. Max becomes upset with his mother for not coming to the fort he made in his room. He wears his wolf costume, acts like an animal, and demands to be fed. When his mother gets upset, he throws a tantrum and bites her on the shoulder. She yells at him and he runs away, scared by what has transpired. At the edge of a pond Max finds a small boat that he boards. | The pond soon becomes an ocean. Max, still in his wolf suit, eventually reaches an island. There, he stumbles upon a group of seven large, monstrous creatures. One of them, Carol, is in the middle of a destructive tantrum (caused by the departure of a female Wild Thing named K.W.) while the others attempt to stop him. As Carol wreaks havoc Max tries to join in on the mayhem, but soon finds himself facing the suspicious anger of the Wild Things. When they contemplate eating him, Max convinces them that he is a king with magical powers capable of bringing harmony to the group. They crown him as their new king. Shortly after, K.W. returns and Max declares a wild rumpus, in which the Wild Things smash trees and tackle each other. | The Wild Things introduce themselves as Carol, Ira, Judith, Alexander, Douglas, the Bull, and K.W. Soon, they all end up piling on one another before going to sleep, with Max at the center. Carol takes Max on a tour of the island, showing him a model he built depicting what he wishes the island looked like. Inspired by this, Max orders the construction of an enormous fort, with Carol in charge of construction. When K.W. brings her two owl friends Bob and Terry to the fort, a disagreement ensues, as Carol feels they are outsiders (Max had said earlier that if any outsiders entered the fort, they would \"have their brains automatically cut out\"). To release their frustrations, Max divides the tribe into \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" for a dirt clod fight, but Alexander is hurt during the game. After an argument between K.W. and Carol, K.W. leaves once again. | Max finds Alexander alone in the fort and has a conversation with him. Alexander reveals that he always suspected that Max is not a king with magical powers, but warns him to never let Carol know. Soon enough, at pre-dawn, Carol throws another tantrum â€” this time, about the fort, K.W.'s absence, and the eventual death of the sun (which Max had talked to Carol about earlier in the film). When Carol gets angry with Max for not doing a good job as a king, Douglas tries to explain to him that he's \"just a boy, pretending to be a wolf, pretending to be a king\", thus exposing the truth to the rest of the Wild Things. Carol becomes enraged and ends up ripping off Douglas' right arm (though only sand pours out of the wound). Then he chases Max into the forest and attempts to eat him. Max is saved by K.W., who hides him in her stomach. Max listens as Carol and K.W. have an argument over Carol's misbehavior. After Carol leaves, K.W. explains that their lives are difficult, with Carol's tantrums only making it worse. Max realizes what his mother is going through, and decides to leave the island and head home. | Max finds the crushed remains of Carol's model island (presumably destroyed by Carol himself in a rage) and leaves a token of affection for him to find (a letter C inside a love-heart made of twigs). He finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king. The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat. Carol runs to join them after finding Max's token and arrives in time to see him off. He starts to howl and Max howls back, then all the other Wild Things join in. Carol looks at K.W. and she smiles kindly at him. Returning home, Max is embraced by his distraught mother, who gives him a bowl of hot soup, a piece of cake and a glass of milk and sits with him as he eats. He watches as she falls asleep.","m_cast":"Max Records as Max, a lonely nine-year-old boy with a wild imagination. | Catherine Keener as Connie, Max's mother. | Mark Ruffalo as Adrian, Connie's boyfriend. | Pepita Emmerichs as Claire, Max's sister. | Steve Mouzakis as Max's teacher. | Max Pfeifer, Madeleine Greaves, Joshua Jay, and Ryan Corr as Claire's friends. | James Gandolfini as Carol, an impulsive Wild Thing. | Lauren Ambrose as K.W., the loner of the group. | Chris Cooper as Douglas, a cockatoo-like peace-keeper who is Carol's best friend. | Forest Whitaker as Ira, a gentle, soft-spoken Wild Thing. | Catherine O'Hara as Judith, a Triceratops-like horned Wild Thing, who is Ira's loud, aggressive girlfriend. | Paul Dano as Alexander, a goat-like Wild Thing who is constantly ignored, belittled and mistreated. | Michael Berry Jr. as Bernard the Bull, a quiet, intimidating bull-headed Wild Thing who keeps to himself and rarely speaks. | Spike Jonze as Bob and Terry, two owls, and K.W's friends. | Vincent Crowley as Carol | Alice Parkinson as K.W. | John Leary as Douglas | Sam Longley as Ira | Nick Farnell as Judith | Sonny Gerasimowicz as Alexander | Angus Sampson as Bernard the Bull","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Where the Wild Things Are started its development life in the early 1980s, originally to be an animated feature by Disney that would have blended traditionally animated characters with computer-generated settings. Animators Glen Keane and John Lasseter (who later moved on to Pixar) had completed a test film to see how the animation hybridizing would work out, but the project proceeded no further.[3] Universal Studios acquired rights to the book's adaptation in 2001 and initially attempted to develop a computer-animated adaptation with Disney animator Eric Goldberg, but in 2003 the CGI concept was replaced with a live-action one, and Goldberg was replaced with Spike Jonze.[citation needed][7] | After years of interest from various producers, Sendak favored Spike Jonze as director, noting he was \"young, interesting and had a spark that none of the others had\".[8] The film was originally set for release from Universal, and a teaser of the film was attached to the studio's 2000 adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas.[9] Disagreements between Universal and Sendak over Jonze's approach to the story led to a turnaround arrangement where the film's production was transferred to Warner Bros.[10] | \"Spike Jonze: Check. Dave Eggers: Check. Yeah Yeah Yeahs: Check. Where the Wild Things Are has all the ingredients to become the hipster equivalent of Star Wars.\" | In 2005, Jonze and Dave Eggers completed a 111-page screenplay, expanding the original ten-sentence story. On July 8, 2006, production began open auditions for the role of Max.[12] The process took months, but, eventually Max Records was cast. Academy Award-winning make-up effects supervisor Howard Berger (The Chronicles of Narnia) turned down offers to work on the film four times. Although the book inspired him as a child to work in special effects, he felt filming it was a \"horrible idea.\"[13] Jim Henson's Creature Shop provided the animatronic suits for the Wild Things. | Filming began in April 2006 at Docklands Studios Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia.[14] Jonze kept in close consultation with Sendak throughout the process, and the author approved creature designs created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. To make the set a more comfortable environment for Max Records, Jonze encouraged the crew members to bring their children to the set. Some of them can be seen in the film's classroom scene.[15] | Michelle Williams was originally cast as the female Wild Thing K.W. only to leave the project after her voice \"didn't match the original vision of how the Wild Thing should sound\".[16] She was replaced by Lauren Ambrose, and filming continued. | In 2008, test footage was leaked onto the internet leading to mixed reactions. Jonze responded, \"That was a very early test with the sole purpose of just getting some footage to Ben, our VFX supervisor, to see if our VFX plan for the faces would work.\" Following early fan outcry over the leaked video and rumored \"scared children\" in test audiences, Warner Bros. announced a year-long delay. On February 20, 2008, speculation emerged that Warner Bros. was considering reshooting the entire film.[17] then-WB president Alan F. Horn responded, \"We've given him more money and, even more importantly, more time for him to work on the film. We'd like to find a common ground that represents Spike's vision but still offers a film that really delivers for a broad-based audience. No one wants to turn this into a bland, sanitized studio movie. This is a very special piece of material and we're just trying to get it right.\" Producer Gary Goetzman followed, \"We support Spike's vision. We're helping him make the vision he wants to make.\"[18] At the end of 2008, Spike got together with Framestore in London to complete his movie and work with them to bring to life the performances through their animation and visual effects team. Over the course of the next six months Spike spent time with the animators on the floor of the studio as they worked together to realise his intention for the performances that had started many years before with the voices, continued with the suit performances in Australia, and were completed in London's Soho. | For the film's trailer, Arcade Fire provided a re-recorded version of the track \"Wake Up\" from their album Funeral.[19] The new version is not featured in the actual film or the soundtrack and has never been made available to the public. | During the film, various songs can be heard such as \"Hideaway\", \"Rumpus\", \"Worried Shoes\" and \"All is Love\" by \"Karen O, Zahida K, Anisa R K, and the Kids\".","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Where the Wild Things AreÂ  by Maurice Sendak","m_directed_by":"Spike Jonze","m_produced_by":"Tom Hanks Gary Goetzman Maurice Sendak John Carls Vincent Landay","m_screenplay_by":"Spike Jonze Dave Eggers","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Max Records Catherine Keener Mark Ruffalo Lauren Ambrose Chris Cooper James Gandolfini Catherine O'Hara Forest Whitaker","m_music_by":"Karen O Carter Burwell","m_cinematography":"Lance Acord","m_edited_by":"Eric Zumbrunnen James Haygood","m_production_company":"Legendary Pictures Village Roadshow Pictures Wild Things Productions Playtone","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

Written by Jonze and Dave Eggers, it is adapted from Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book of the same name. It combines live-action, performers in costumes, animatronics, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). The film stars Max Records, and features the voices of James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Lauren Ambrose, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Cooper.
