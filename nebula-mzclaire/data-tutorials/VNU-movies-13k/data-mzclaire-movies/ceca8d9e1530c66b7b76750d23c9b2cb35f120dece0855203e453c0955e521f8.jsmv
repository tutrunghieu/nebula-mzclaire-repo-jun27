They arrive at the fictional Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw (\"Rough Fountain\" or \"Rough Spring\" in Welsh) to measure its \"mountain\" – only to cause outrage when they conclude that it is only a hill because it is slightly short of the required 1000 feet in height. The villagers, aided and abetted by the wily Morgan the Goat and the Reverend Mr Jones (who after initially opposing the scheme, grasps its symbolism in restoring the community's war-damaged self-esteem), conspire with Morgan to delay the cartographers' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough to be considered a mountain.","m_cast":"Hugh Grant as Reginald Anson | Ian McNeice as George Garrad | Tara FitzGerald as Elizabeth/Betty from Cardiff | Colm Meaney as Morgan the Goat | Ian Hart as Johnny Shellshocked | Robert Pugh as Williams the Petroleum | Kenneth Griffith as the Reverend Robert Jones | Ieuan Rhys as Sgt Thomas","m_reception":"In regard to its humorous and affectionate description of the locals, the film has often been compared with Waking Ned Devine, a comedy film written and directed by Kirk Jones.

Due to 20th century urbanisation of the area, it was filmed in the more rural Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant and Llansilin in Mid Wales. The Welsh Male Voice Choir used to provide background music throughout the film was, in fact, the London based Gwalia Male Choir. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"19th Moscow International Film Festival (1995)\".
