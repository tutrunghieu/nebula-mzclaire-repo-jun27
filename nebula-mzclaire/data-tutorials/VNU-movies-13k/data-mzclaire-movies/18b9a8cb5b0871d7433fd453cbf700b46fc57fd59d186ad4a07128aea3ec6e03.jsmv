Neither director Michael Powell nor star David Niven was very interested in doing the film, but had their minds changed by threats of contract suspension. (Rex Harrison had been originally announced as the star.)[4] Powell wanted to make the film as a musical, but was not allowed to, and Margaret Leighton was cast despite his objection. Goldwyn forced numerous additions and changes to the film but when Powell delivered the final cut, Goldwyn refused to make the final payment, which caused Korda to sue him.[5] | The film was shot in 1949[6] at various British film studios in Boreham Wood, Elstree and Shepperton, Surrey. Location shooting took place in Bath, Dover, in Savernake Forest, on the Marlborough Downs, and in the stables of Carlton House Terrace, St. James's, London. In France, filming took place in the chateaux of the Loire Valley and on Mont Saint-Michel.[5][7] | The Elusive Pimpernel was released in the UK in 1950, but because of the falling out between Korda and Goldwyn, did not gain an American distributor until July 1953 when Carroll Pictures acquired the rights. The film then premiered in New York City on 17 April 1954.[5] | Niven's unhappiness at being forced to make the film later led to him severing his contract with Samuel Goldwyn.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Powell Emeric Pressburger","m_produced_by":"Michael Powell Emeric Pressburger","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"David Niven Margaret Leighton","m_music_by":"Brian Easdale","m_cinematography":"Christopher Challis","m_edited_by":"Reginald Mills","m_production_company":"London Films","m_distributed_by":"British Lion Films (UK) Carroll Films (US)","m_release_dates":"6 February 1950 (UK) 17 April 1954 (NYC) 1955 (US general)","m_running_time":"109 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£477,000[1]","m_box_office":"£133,354 (UK)[2] | The Elusive Pimpernel is a 1950 British period adventure film by the British-based director-writer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, based on the novel The Scarlet Pimpernel (1905) by Baroness Emmuska Orczy.
