{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A schoolteacher, Junpei Niki (Eiji Okada), is on an expedition to collect insects that inhabit sand dunes. When he misses the last bus, the villagers suggest that he stay the night. They guide him down a rope ladder to a house in a sand quarry, to stay with a young widow (Kyōko Kishida), a meek and simple woman whose husband and daughter were killed in a sandstorm and who now lives alone. She is employed by the villagers to dig sand for sale to be used in concrete, and to save the house from burial in the advancing sand. | When Junpei tries to leave the next morning, he finds the ladder removed. The villagers expect him to become the woman's husband, to assist her in digging sand, and to have a child with her. Junpei initially tries to climb the sand, but it keeps collapsing. Junpei becomes the widow's lover, but he still yearns to leave. One morning, using an improvised grappling hook, he escapes from the sand dune and starts running while being chased by the villagers. However, he is unfamiliar with the geography of the area and becomes trapped in quicksand. The villagers free him and return him to the house. | Eventually, Junpei resigns himself to his fate. He requests time to watch the nearby sea, and the villagers offer to grant it if he makes love to the woman while they watch, but she fends him off. Through his persistent effort to trap a crow as a messenger, he discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night and becomes absorbed in the task of perfecting the technique. | When it is discovered that the woman is pregnant, the villagers take her to a doctor and forget to remove the rope ladder before they leave. Junpei now has a chance to escape, but chooses to stay. A report, after seven years, written by the police and signed by his mother, has declared him disappeared.","m_cast":"Eiji Okada – Entomologist Niki Junpei | Kyōko Kishida – Woman | Hiroko Itō – Entomologist's wife | Kōji Mitsui | Sen Yano | Ginzō Sekiguchi","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Hiroshi Teshigahara","m_produced_by":"Kiichi Ichikawa Tadashi Ōno","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Eiji Okada Kyōko Kishida","m_music_by":"Toru Takemitsu","m_cinematography":"Hiroshi Segawa","m_edited_by":"Fusako Shuzui","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Toho","m_release_dates":"February 15, 1964 (1964-02-15) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"123 minutes 147 minutes (director's cut)","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"Japanese","m_budget":"$100,000 | Woman in the Dunes or Woman of the Dunes (砂の女, Suna no Onna?, \"Sand woman\") is a 1964 Japanese film directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara and starring Eiji Okada and Kyōko Kishida.
