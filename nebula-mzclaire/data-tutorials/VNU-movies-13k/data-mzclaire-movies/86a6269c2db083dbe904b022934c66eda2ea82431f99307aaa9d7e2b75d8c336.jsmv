{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) arrives at the mountain-isolated Overlook Hotel, which is 25 miles from the closest town, to interview for the position of winter caretaker. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. The hotel, built on the site of a Native American burial ground, becomes snowed-in during the winter; it is closed from October to May. Manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) warns Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd), has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, viewing a cascade of blood emerging from an elevator door, and then falls into a trance. Jack's wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge. | The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour. The chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream. Dick explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls \"shining\". Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly room 237. Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel has a \"shine\" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay out of room 237. | A month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze. Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has frightening visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. | Danny's curiosity about room 237 overcomes him when he sees the room's door open. Later, Wendy finds Jack, screaming during a nightmare while asleep at his typewriter. After she awakens him, Jack says he dreamed that he killed her and Danny. Danny arrives with a bruise on his neck and traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing him. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room and meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd (Joe Turkel). Lloyd serves him bourbon while Jack complains about his marriage. | Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her a \"crazy woman in one of the rooms\" attempted to strangle him. Jack investigates room 237, encountering the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy that he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue over whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts attending a ball. He meets the ghost of Grady (Philip Stone) who tells Jack that he must \"correct\" his wife and child and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his \"talent\". In Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and flies back to Colorado. Danny starts calling out \"redrum\" and goes into a trance, referring to himself as \"Tony\". | While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers he has been typing pages of a repetitive manuscript: \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\". She begs Jack to leave the hotel with Danny, but he confronts and threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat. She drags him into the kitchen and locks him in the pantry, but she and Danny are both trapped at the hotel; Jack has sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who unlocks the door. | Danny writes \"REDRUM\" on the outside of the bathroom door in the family's living quarters. When Wendy sees the word reversed in the bedroom mirror, the word is revealed to be \"MURDER\". Jack begins hacking through the quarters' main door with a firefighter's axe. Wendy sends Danny through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to pass. Jack breaks through the bathroom door, shouting \"Here's Johnny!\", but retreats after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher's knife. | Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann borrowed to reach the hotel, Jack leaves the room. He ambushes and kills Hallorann with the axe, and pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering ghosts and the cascade of blood Danny envisioned in Boulder. She also finds Hallorann's body lying in the lobby. Danny lays a false trail to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints. Wendy and Danny flee in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack, lost in the maze, slowly freezes to death. | In a photograph in the hotel hallway dated July 4, 1921, Jack Torrance smiles amid a crowd of party revelers.","m_cast":"Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance | Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance | Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance and the voice of Tony | Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann | Barry Nelson as Stuart Ullman | Philip Stone as Delbert Grady | Joe Turkel as Lloyd | Tony Burton as Larry Durkin | Lia Beldam as Young Woman In Bath | Billie Gibson as Old Woman In Bath | Barry Dennen as Bill Watson | Lisa Burns as Grady Daughter #1 | Louise Burns as Grady Daughter #2 | Anne Jackson as Doctor | In the shorter European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton are cut (although their names still appear in the credits).

In the film's dialogue, Mr. Ullman identifies them as \"about eight and ten.\" Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as \"the Grady twins.\" | The resemblance in the staging of the Grady girls and the \"Twins\" photograph by Diane Arbus has been noted both by Arbus' biographer, Patricia Bosworth,[12] and by numerous Kubrick critics.[13] Although Kubrick both met Arbus personally and studied photography under her during his youthful days as photographer for Look magazine, Kubrick's widow says he did not deliberately model the Grady girls on Arbus' photograph, in spite of widespread attention to the resemblance.[14]","m_reception":"The film had a slow start at the box office, but gained momentum, eventually doing well commercially during the summer of 1980 and making Warner Bros. a profit. It opened at first to mixed reviews. For example, Variety was critical, saying \"With everything to work with, ... Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.\"[38] It was the only one of Kubrick's last nine films to receive no nominations at all from either the Oscars or Golden Globes, but was nominated for a pair of Razzie Awards, including Worst Director and Worst Actress (Duvall),[39] in the first year that award was given.[40][41][42][43] | As with most Kubrick films, more recent analyses have treated the film more favorably. A common initial criticism was the slow pacing which was highly atypical of horror films of the time; viewers subsequently decided this actually contributes to the film's hypnotic quality.[44] Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 89% \"Certified Fresh\".[45] | Roger Ebert did not review the film on his television show when first released,[46] and in print complained that it was hard to connect with any of the characters[47] but in 2006, The Shining made it into Ebert's series of \"Great Movie\" reviews, saying \"Stanley Kubrick's cold and frightening The Shining challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust?\" ... \"It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick's film so strangely disturbing.\"[48] | In 1999, Jonathan Romney discussed Kubrick's perfectionism and dispelled others' initial arguments that the film lacked complexity: \"The final scene alone demonstrates what a rich source of perplexity The Shining offers [...] look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox\". Romney further explains:[49] | The dominating presence of the Overlook Hotel – designed by Roy Walker as a composite of American hotels visited in the course of research – is an extraordinary vindication of the value of mise en scène. It's a real, complex space that we don't just see but come to virtually inhabit. The confinement is palpable: horror cinema is an art of claustrophobia, making us loath to stay in the cinema but unable to leave. Yet it's combined with a sort of agoraphobia – we are as frightened of the hotel's cavernous vastness as of its corridors' enclosure. ... The film sets up a complex dynamic between simple domesticity and magnificent grandeur, between the supernatural and the mundane in which the viewer is disoriented by the combination of spaciousness and confinement, and an uncertainty as to just what is real or not. | Speaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".[27] Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation[50] and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could \"remember hating\".[51] However, in King's 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, he listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have \"contributed something of value to the [horror] genre\" and mentioned it as one of his \"personal favorites.\"[52] Before the 1980 movie King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.[6] | King himself was suffering from alcoholism at the time he wrote the novel, therefore giving a strong autobiographical element to the story. He has expressed disappointment that his novel's important themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less prevalent in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would ultimately go mad, due to Nicholson's famous identification with the character of McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). King had suggested that a more “everyman”-like actor such as Jon Voight, Christopher Reeve, or Michael Moriarty play the role, so that Jack's subsequent descent into madness would be more unnerving.[6] | In an interview with the BBC, King also criticized Shelley Duvall's performance in the film, stating \"(S)he's basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that's not the woman that I wrote about.\"[53] | Over the years, contradictions have arisen in the discussion of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself.[54] In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:[55] | King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining,” the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick. | King's oft-cited remark about Kubrick being a man who “thinks too much and feels too little” is often misconstrued as a remark on Kubrick's obsessive and detached approach to directing actors, but it is actually a less disparaging reference to Kubrick's skepticism regarding the verisimilitude of the supernatural, which emerged in pre-production conversations between King and Kubrick. The full context of King's well-known quote is: | Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.[56] | Mark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks.[57] Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little.\" | King was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled The Shining, filmed at The Stanley Hotel. | The animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\". | Nonetheless, writing in the afterword of Doctor Sleep, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember — for reasons I have never quite understood — as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.\" | Horror film critic Peter Bracke reviewing the Blu-ray release in Hi-Def Digest writes: | Just as the ghostly apparitions of the film's fictional Overlook Hotel would play tricks on the mind of poor Jack Torrance, so too has the passage of time changed the perception of The Shining itself. Many of the same reviewers who lambasted the film for \"not being scary\" enough back in 1980 now rank it among the most effective horror films ever made, while audiences who hated the film back then now vividly recall being \"terrified\" by the experience. The Shining has somehow risen from the ashes of its own bad press to redefine itself not only as a seminal work of the genre, but perhaps the most stately, artful horror ever made. | The Shining is widely acclaimed by today's critics, and has become a staple of pop culture.[44][58] In 2001, the film was ranked 29th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills list and Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list in 2003. In 2005, the quote \"Here's Johnny!\" was ranked 68 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list. It was named the all-time scariest film by Channel 4,[59] Total Film labeled it the 5th greatest horror film,[60] and Bravo TV named one of the film's scenes 6th on their list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. In addition, film critics Kim Newman[61] and Jonathan Romney[62] both placed it in their top ten lists for the 2002 Sight & Sound poll. Director Martin Scorsese placed The Shining on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.[63] Mathematicians at London's King's College used statistical modeling in a study commissioned by Sky Movies to conclude that The Shining was the \"perfect scary movie\" due to a proper balance of various ingredients including shock value, suspense, gore and size of the cast.[64][65] | AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills – #29 | AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains: Jack Torrance – #25 Villain | AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: \"Here's Johnny!\" – #68 \"Come play with us, Danny. Forever, and ever, and ever.\" - Nominated | AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – Nominated[66]","m_production":"Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick directed the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who attempts to make his way into the English aristocracy. Despite its technical achievement, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndon's lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all. \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining.\"[15] | After having chosen Stephen King's novel The Shining as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Britain — to enable chronological filming and changes during production, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production. The set for the Overlook Hotel was then the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel.[16] Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. | While most of the interior shots, and even some of the Overlook exterior shots were done on studio sets, a few exterior shots were done on location by a second-unit crew headed by Jan Harlan: Saint Mary Lake with Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana was the filming location for the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road. The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel, and notably absent in these shots is the hedge maze — something the Timberline Lodge does not have. In spring 1979, due to intense lighting used by Kubrick, the set burst into flames and destroyed the building; it had to be completely rebuilt.[17] | This film was among the first half-dozen to use the newly developed Steadicam (after the 1976 films Bound for Glory, Marathon Man, and Rocky), and was Kubrick's first use of it.[18] This is a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator's movement from the camera's, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface. It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production. Brown published an article in American Cinematographer about his experience,[19] and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release of The Shining. Brown describes his excitement taking his first tour of the sets which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\". Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used — as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\". Brown used an 18 mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames.[20] | Kubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam's video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick's film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that: | One of the most talked-about shots in the picture is the eerie tracking sequence which follows Danny as he pedals at high speed through corridor after corridor on his plastic Big Wheel tricycle. The soundtrack explodes with noise when the wheel is on wooden flooring and is abruptly silent as it crosses over carpet. We needed to have the lens just a few inches from the floor and to travel rapidly just behind or ahead of the bike. | This required the Steadicam to be on a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take.[21] Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam. | The Shining had a prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get on with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Jack Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team would give to him to memorize, knowing that it was just going to change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days.[22] | Nicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month),[23] Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval.[24] | The opening panorama shots (outtakes of which were used by Ridley Scott for the closing moments of the original cut of the film Blade Runner) and scenes of the Volkswagen Beetle on the road to the hotel were filmed from a helicopter in Glacier National Park in Montana on the Going-to-the-Sun Road. | For the final Gold Room sequence, Kubrick instructed the extras (via megaphone) not to talk, \"but to mime conversation to each other. Kubrick knew from years of scrutinizing thousands of films that extras could often mime their business by nodding and using large gestures that look fake. He told them to act naturally to give the scene a chilling sense of time-tripping realism as Jack walks from the seventies into the roaring twenties\".[25] | For international versions of the film, Kubrick shot different takes of Wendy reading the typewriter pages in different languages. For each language, a suitable idiom was used: German (Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf morgen — \"Never put off till tomorrow what may be done today\"), Italian (Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca — \"The morning has gold in its mouth\"), French (Un «Tiens» vaut mieux que deux «Tu l'auras» — \"One 'here you go' is worth more than two 'you'll have it'\", the equivalent of \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\"), Spanish (No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano — \"No matter how early you get up, you can't make the sun rise any sooner.\") These alternate shots were not included with the DVD release, where only the English phrase \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" was used. | In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.[26] | Speaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".[27] | During production, Kubrick screened David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977) to the cast and crew, to convey the mood he wanted to achieve for the film.[28] | The door that Jack chops through with the axe near the end of the film was a real door. Kubrick had originally shot this scene with a fake door, but Nicholson, who had worked as a volunteer fire marshal, tore it down too quickly. Jack's line, \"Heeeere's Johnny!\", is taken from Ed McMahon's famous introduction to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and was improvised by Nicholson. Kubrick, who had lived in England for some time, was unaware of the significance of the line, and nearly used a different take.[29] Carson later used the Nicholson clip to open his 1980 anniversary show on NBC. | Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks, starting at 9am and finishing at 10:30pm each day, with Turkel recollecting that his clothes would be soaked in his own sweat by the end of every day's shoot. He also added that it was his favorite scene in the film.[30]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Shining  by Stephen King","m_directed_by":"Stanley Kubrick","m_produced_by":"Stanley Kubrick","m_screenplay_by":"Stanley Kubrick | Diane Johnson","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jack Nicholson | Shelley Duvall | Scatman Crothers | Danny Lloyd","m_music_by":"Wendy Carlos | Rachel Elkind","m_cinematography":"John Alcott","m_edited_by":"Ray Lovejoy","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"May 23, 1980 (1980-05-23) (United States) | November 7, 1980 (1980-11-07) (United Kingdom) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"146 minutes (Premiere) | 144 minutes (American)[1] | 119 minutes (European)[2]","m_country":"United Kingdom | United States[3]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$19 million[4]","m_box_office":"$44.4 million (North America)[4] | The Shining is a 1980 British-American psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick,[5] co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers. The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel The Shining, although the film and novel differ slightly but significantly.[6] In the film, Jack Torrance, a writer and recovering alcoholic, takes a job as an off-season caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel. His young son possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future, such as the ghosts who haunt the hotel. Some time after settling in, the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm, and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a ghostly presence, descends into madness, and ultimately attempts to murder his wife and son. | The initial European release of The Shining was 25 minutes shorter than the American version, achieved by removing most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel. Unlike Kubrick's previous works, which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth, The Shining was released as a mass-market film, initially opening in two cities on Memorial Day, then nationwide a month later.[7] Although contemporary responses from critics were mixed, assessment became more favorable in following decades, and it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. American director Martin Scorsese, writing in The Daily Beast, ranked it one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time.[8] Critics, scholars, and crew members (such as Kubrick's producer Jan Harlan) have discussed the film's enormous influence on popular culture.[9][10][11] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE SHINING\".
