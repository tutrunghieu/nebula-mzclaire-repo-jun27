Kurt (Christopher Lee), the older son of Count Menliff (Gustavo De Nardo), was in marriage preparations with Nevenka (Daliah Lavi). However, Kurt had an affair with Tania, the daughter of Menliffs' servant Giorgia (Harriet Medin), and Tania committed suicide because of Kurt's prospective marriage. Count Menliff rejected Kurt and he left the castle. Meanwhile, Nevenka married Cristiano (Tony Kendall), Kurt's younger brother. | One day, Kurt arrives at the castle, superficially to celebrate Cristiano and Nevenka but in fact he is to reclaim his title and fortune, which supposedly also includes Nevenka. During an evening on the beach and following a session of flogging and sex, masochistic Nevenka understands that she is still in love with Kurt. Frustrated, she does not return to the castle and is eventually found unconscious by the butler Losat (Luciano Pigozzi). On the same night, Kurt is killed under curious circumstances, with the same dagger Tania had committed suicide with. Now, Kurt is dead but a series of events hints that his ghost has started to haunt the castle for revenge.","m_cast":"Daliah Lavi as Nevenka Menliff | Christopher Lee as Kurt Menliff | Luciano Stella as Christian Menliff | Ida Galli as Katia | Harriet Medin as Giorgia | Gustavo De Nardo as Count Menliff | Luciano Pigozzi as Losat | Jacques Herlin as the Priest | [1]","m_reception":"In contemporary reviews, The Monthly Film Bulletin reviewed the 77-minutes English-dubbed version titled Night is the Phantom in 1965.[7] The review referred to the film as \"slow, repetitive, verging on parody\" and that either \"censor or distributor cuts have rendered much of the plot incomprehensible, thought one doubts if it ever made sense entirely.\"[7] The review compared the film to other genre films of the era, calling it \"another of Italy's prankish simulations of British horror movie\" as well as stating that \"Mario Bava copies [Riccardo] Freda almost slavishly\" but \"still pulls off some arresting pictorial compositions\".[7] In 1970, screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi stated that the film disappointed him.[3] Gastaldi described that he felt about the story “in terms of a psychological nightmare, in the style of Clouzot's films, but Bava saw in it a baroque and decadent drama, and emphasized such tones beyond belief.”[3][8] | From retrospective reviews, Slant Magazine gave the film four and a half stars out of five, stating that the film found \"Bava at the peak of his visual prowess\"[9] Online film database AllMovie found that Bava's \"exceptional visual style helps to lift an otherwise gloomy picture\".
