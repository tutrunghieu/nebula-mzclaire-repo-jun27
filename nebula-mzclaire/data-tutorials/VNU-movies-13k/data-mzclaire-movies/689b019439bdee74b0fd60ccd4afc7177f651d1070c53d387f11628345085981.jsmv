{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A Dutch couple, Rex and Saskia, are on holiday in France. As they drive, Saskia shares a recurring dream in which she is drifting through space in a golden egg. In the most recent dream, another egg containing another person appeared; she felt the collision of the two eggs would signify the end of something. | Their car runs out of petrol and they stop at a rest area, where a man in another car dons a false sling and orthopedic cast. Rex promises to never abandon Saskia and they bury two coins at the base of a tree as a symbol of their romance. When Saskia enters the petrol station to buy drinks and does not return, Rex frantically searches for her. | Some time earlier, Raymond, a wealthy family man, secretly plots to abduct a woman. He buys an isolated house, experiments with chloroform, and rehearses scenarios in which he entices women into his car. When his initial attempts at abduction fail, he poses as an injured motorist in need of assistance and goes to the rest area out of town where he will not be recognised. | Three years after Saskia's disappearance, Rex is still searching for her. He has received several postcards inviting him to meet the kidnapper at a cafe in Nimes, but the kidnapper never comes. Unknown to Rex, the cafe is directly opposite Raymond's apartment, from where he watches Rex wait. Rex's new girlfriend, Lieneke, reluctantly helps him search for Saskia. One day, Rex has a dream similar to Saskia's in which he is trapped in a golden egg. Unable to endure his obsession, Lieneke leaves him. | Rex makes a public appeal on television, saying he only wants to know the truth about what happened to Saskia. Raymond confronts Rex and admits the kidnapping; he says he will reveal what happened to her if Rex comes with him. As they drive, Raymond says that he has known from a young age that he has no conscience, and is therefore capable of anything. After saving a young girl from drowning, he resolved to commit the worst crime he could imagine to learn whether doing something good felt better. He describes how he kidnapped Saskia at the rest stop by posing as a traveling salesman and enticing her into his car after she asked about buying a gift for Rex. | Raymond takes Rex to the rest area. He dismisses Rex's threats of police action, saying there is no evidence connecting him to the crime. He pours Rex a cup of drugged coffee, and tells him the only way to learn what happened to Saskia is to experience it himself. As Raymond waits in the car, Rex rages, unsure of what to do. After digging up the coins he and Saskia buried years earlier, he drinks the coffee and awakens buried in a box underground. Raymond relaxes at his country home, surrounded by his wife and children.","m_cast":"Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu as Raymond Lemorne (his surname means 'gloomy'), a French chemistry professor, who was diagnosed as a sociopath in his teens.

Extensive use of flashbacks and gradually revealed personality traits of the central characters lend depth to the film.;[14] the second major difference involves the direct interaction between the characters Rex Hofman and Raymond Lemorne, who spend more time together following their meeting.[14] | Sluizer was suggested by a casting woman to see Johanna ter Steege who was in a student play for the role of Saskia Wagter.[15] When Sluizer saw Steege's hair was a similar colors to his daughter, he decided that she would be right for the role in the film.[16] For the role of Rex, there was a choice between two actors: a Dutch actor and the Belgian actor Gene Bervoets.[17] Sluizer chose Bervoets as his French was stronger but was unsure on set if he chose the right actor for the role and Bervoets which led to the two being slightly uncomfortable on set.[18] Sluizer initially wanted Jean-Louis Trintignant for the role of Raymond Lemorne but found he was already booked for the entire year.[19] On thinking of French actors who could fill the role, he thought of the actor Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu who was had a small role in his film Twice a Woman (1979).[20] Sluizer found he had worked in television and leading film roles since Twice a Woman and got him signed to agree for the role.[21]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Golden Egg  by Tim Krabbé","m_directed_by":"George Sluizer","m_produced_by":"Anne Lordon | George Sluizer","m_screenplay_by":"George Sluizer | Tim Krabbé","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu | Gene Bervoets | Johanna ter Steege | Gwen Eckhaus","m_music_by":"Hennie Vrienten","m_cinematography":"Toni Kuhn","m_edited_by":"George Sluizer | Lin Friedman","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Argos Films","m_release_dates":"27 October 1988 (1988-10-27) (Netherlands) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"107 minutes","m_country":"Netherlands France","m_language":"Dutch, French[2] | The Vanishing (Dutch: Spoorloos, literally \"Traceless\" or \"Without a Trace\") is a Dutch–French film adaptation of the novella The Golden Egg by Tim Krabbé, released on 27 October 1988.
