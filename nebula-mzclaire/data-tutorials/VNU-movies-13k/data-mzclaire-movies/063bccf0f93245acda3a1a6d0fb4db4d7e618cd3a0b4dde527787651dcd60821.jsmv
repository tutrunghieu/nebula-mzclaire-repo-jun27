{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set within Terminal 3 of London Heathrow Airport during a fog. As flights are delayed, the VIPs (very important people) of the title play out the drama of their lives in a number of slightly interconnected stories. The delays have caused serious hardship for most of the characters and have plunged some of them into a deep personal or financial crisis. | The central story concerns famed actress Frances Andros (Elizabeth Taylor) trying to leave her husband, millionaire Paul Andros (Richard Burton), and fly away with her lover Marc Champselle (Louis Jourdan). Because of the fog, Andros has the opportunity to come to the airport to convince his wife not to leave him. | Film producer Max Buda (Orson Welles) needs to leave London, taking his newest protégée Gloria Gritti (Elsa Martinelli) with him, by midnight if he is to avoid paying a hefty tax bill. The Duchess of Brighton (Margaret Rutherford), meanwhile, is on her way to Florida to take a job which will pay her enough money to save her historic home. | Les Mangrum (Rod Taylor), an Australian businessman, must get to New York City to prevent his business from being sold. His dutiful secretary, Miss Mead (Maggie Smith), is secretly in love with him. It being a matter of great urgency, she decides to approach Andros and ask him to advance the money, which will save Mangrum's company. | Buda spots a poster picturing the Duchess's home. She is offered a sum of money if she will permit Buda to use it as a location in a film, enough to keep the house she loves. Andros, meanwhile, about to lose the woman he loves, is spared a possible suicide at the last minute when he and his wife reconcile.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"According to Rattigan, the film is based on the true story of actress Vivien Leigh's attempt to leave her husband, actor Laurence Olivier, and fly off with her lover, the actor Peter Finch, only to be delayed by a fog at Heathrow.[3] | Asquith chose Sophia Loren for Andros's role, remembering the box-office success of the romantic comedy film The Millionairess (1960) he did with Loren in the main role. However, Taylor, scared by the appeal Loren had for Burton, persuaded Asquith to hire her instead; \"Let Sophia stay in Rome\", she told him.[4] | This was the first time Australian actor Rod Taylor had ever played an Australian character on film. Terence Rattigan allowed him to Australian-ise some of the dialogue.[5] Stringer Davis, Rutherford's husband, appears in a tiny role as Mr. Stringer, a sympathetic hotel waiter in a scene with her. Raymond Austin, a stuntman and a friend of Burton's, appears in the film as Andros's driver. Television personality David Frost portrays a reporter interviewing the VIPs at the airport.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Anthony Asquith","m_produced_by":"Anatole de Grunwald","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Richard Burton Elizabeth Taylor Louis Jourdan Maggie Smith Orson Welles Rod Taylor Elsa Martinelli Margaret Rutherford","m_music_by":"Miklós Rózsa","m_cinematography":"Jack Hildyard","m_edited_by":"Frank Clarke (editor)","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"19 September 1963 (United States)","m_running_time":"119 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$4 million[1]","m_box_office":"$15,000,000[2] | The V.I.P.s, also known as Hotel International, is a 1963 British drama film in Metrocolor and Panavision.
