{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is based on the fate of the brigantine Albatross, which sank May 2, 1961, allegedly because of a white squall. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), whom the boys call \"Skipper\". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Gieg (Scott Wolf), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont (Jeremy Sisto), shy Gil Martin (Ryan Phillippe) and bad-boy Dean Preston (Eric Michael Cole). When a white squall threatens their ship, the boys try to use what Skipper has taught them to survive the horrific ordeal.","m_cast":"Jeff Bridges as Christopher \"Skipper\" Sheldon | Caroline Goodall as Alice Sheldon | John Savage as McCrea | Scott Wolf as Chuck Gieg | Jeremy Sisto as Frank Beaumont | Ryan Phillippe as Gil Martin | Eric Michael Cole as Dean Preston | Julio Oscar Mechoso as Girard Pascal | Balthazar Getty as Tod Johnstone | Jason Marsden as Shay Jennings | David Lascher as Robert March | Ethan Embry as Tracy Lapchick | David Selby as Francis Beaumont | Jordan Clarke as Charles Gieg, Sr. | Željko Ivanek as Capt.

In his review he said \"I enjoyed the movie for the sheer physical exuberance of its adventure.\"[5]","m_production":"Part of the film was shot using a horizon tank in Malta, with a full-sized ship, the Eye of the Wind, used to depict the Albatross.[3] Maurice Jarre was originally slated to compose the original score, but was replaced by Hans Zimmer's protégé Jeff Rona. Zimmer was set to replace Jarre, but due to time difficulties failed to commit. The song in the end credits is Valparaiso by Sting.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Last Voyage of the Albatross  by Charles Gieg","m_directed_by":"Ridley Scott","m_produced_by":"Mimi Polk Gitlin Rocky Lang","m_screenplay_by":"Todd Robinson","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jeff Bridges John Savage Ryan Phillippe Scott Wolf Balthazar Getty Jeremy Sisto Jason Marsden Eric Michael Cole","m_music_by":"Jeff Rona","m_cinematography":"Hugh Johnson","m_edited_by":"Gerry Hambling","m_production_company":"Hollywood Pictures Largo Entertainment Scott Free Productions","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"February 2, 1996 (1996-02-02) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"129 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$38 million[1]","m_box_office":"$10,292,300 (United States)[2] | White Squall is a 1996 American drama feature film, directed by Ridley Scott. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"White Squall - Box Office Data\".
