There is no trace of a special premiere for the program. In Moving Picture World, Pathé simply announced the film as one of its current \"dramatic\" releases, at a length of 853 feet—considerably shorter than the version for which Saint-Saëns had composed his score; and the company dropped the film from its listings five weeks later. There is no record that the score was even heard in America at that time. Neither the film nor the score was suited to the nickelodeon-centered American film industry in 1909, but it was nevertheless reviewed extensively over the next several weeks. | It received considerable attention from critics because of the reputation of its creators and crew. Many critics noted that with the movie's basis in French history, the film might appeal to the upper class, but the average American moviegoer might not be able to follow the plot. When comparing the movie with contemporary American historical drama, many critics considered The Assassination to have better photography, better acting, and better dramatic construction.","m_production":"The Assassination was one of the first and most successful films to be made by Le Film d'Art (fr), a production company founded in 1907 with the intention of making films that would earn the respect of the cultural elite as well as the patronage of large audiences.[4] The script was written for the screen (by Henri Lavedan), but its costumes and staging followed the historical tradition of the French theater. | The movie contains the rudiments of the more elaborate narrative techniques of films to come. Although it consists of only nine shots, with theatrical rather than cinematic acting and staging, it presents enough elements of a story that it could be understood on its own. It does this through continuity of action and space. Leading up to and including the assassination, the camera follows the movements of the main character over five separate shots, through three separate rooms and back. Other elements were theatrical rather than filmic, such as sets with painted backdrops and the camera's single stationary position for each scene, reminiscent of a seat on the main floor, not far from the \"stage.\" | Calmettes and Le Bargy were both eminent actors, and Le Bargy a member of the Comédie-Française.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Charles Le Bargy André Calmettes","m_produced_by":"Frères Lafitte","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Charles Le Bargy Albert Lambert Gabrielle Robinne Berthe Bovy","m_music_by":"Camille Saint-Saëns","m_cinematography":"Èmile Pierre","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Pathé Frères","m_release_dates":"17 November 1908 (France) 17 February 1909 (US)","m_running_time":"approx. 15 minutes","m_country":"France","m_language":"French | The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (1908) (original French title: La Mort du duc de Guise; often referred to as L'Assassinat du duc de Guise) is a French historical film directed by Charles Le Bargy and André Calmettes, adapted by Henri Lavedan, and featuring actors of the Comédie-Française and prominent set designers.
