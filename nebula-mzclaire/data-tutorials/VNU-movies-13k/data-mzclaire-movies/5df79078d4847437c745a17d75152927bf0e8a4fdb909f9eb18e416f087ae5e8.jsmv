{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Roy Alston (Maxwell Caulfield) and Bo Richards (Charlie Sheen) are two outcasts of their high school community. Bo receives $200 as a graduation gift from his grandparents. Facing a lifetime of working blue-collar factory jobs, the boys spontaneously decide to use the money to go on a vacation to Los Angeles. | During the drive to Los Angeles, Bo and Roy rob a gas station and beat the attendant with a crowbar. The next day, the boys go to a beach boardwalk, where Roy throws an empty beer bottle in the air and it hits an elderly woman on the forehead. Three young women see this, and chase Bo and Roy to the parking lot. The women yell at the boys and damage their car. Enraged, Roy starts the car and drives around in circles in the parking lot with the woman still on the hood. After several loops, Roy throws the car into reverse, throwing one of the women from the hood of the car. After the incident, one of the women finds Bo and Roy's dog, Boner the Barbarian, and reads his dogtag, which leads to speculation of where Bo and Roy are from. | During a visit to La Brea Tar Pits, Bo expresses his wish that the world could just \"go caveman\" for one day, abandoning all rules and order. Roy agrees, and they hit the streets of Los Angeles for the night. | Several additional encounters lead to more deaths, including a gay man named Chris, a young couple, and an older woman named Angie Baker (Patti D'Arbanville), whom Roy kills and rapes while she is having sex with Bo. Eventually they are tracked and found by the LAPD and chased into a shopping mall. After unsuccessfully trying to steal some guns, Bo tries to talk some sense into Roy about surrendering. Roy refuses, and orders Bo to give him the gun so he can go out in a \"blaze of glory\". Bo refuses and shoots Roy when he tries to take the gun away. The police surround Bo and ask him why he killed his friend. Bo replies, \"Because I had to.\" Bo is then arrested and led away while reporters take his picture.","m_cast":"Charlie Sheen as Bo Richards | Maxwell Caulfield as Roy Alston | Patti D'Arbanville as Angie Baker | Christopher McDonald as Detective Mark Woods | Hank Garrett as Detective Ed Hanley | Grant Heslov as Joe Gonzales | Moon Unit Zappa as Nancy | Dawn Schneider as Bonnie Roberts | Kurt Christian as Shakir | Blackie Dammett as Bartender","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Penelope Spheeris","m_produced_by":"Sandy Howard Keith Rubinstein","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Charlie Sheen Maxwell Caulfield","m_music_by":"George S.
