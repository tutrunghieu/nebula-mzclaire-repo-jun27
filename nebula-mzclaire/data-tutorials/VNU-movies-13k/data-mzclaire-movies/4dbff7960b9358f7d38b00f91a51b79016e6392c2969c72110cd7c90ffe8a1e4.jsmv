{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"An American family—Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" McKenna (James Stewart), his wife, popular singer Josephine Conway \"Jo\" McKenna (Doris Day), and their son Henry \"Hank\" McKenna (Christopher Olsen)—are vacationing in Morocco. Traveling from Casablanca to Marrakesh, they meet Frenchman Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin). He seems friendly, but Jo is suspicious of his many questions and evasive answers. | Louis offers to take the McKennas out to dinner, but cancels when a sinister-looking man knocks at the McKennas' hotel-room door. Later, at a local restaurant, the McKennas meet friendly English couple Lucy (Brenda De Banzie) and Edward Drayton (Bernard Miles). The McKennas are surprised to see Bernard arrive and sit at another table, apparently ignoring them. | The next day, attending a busy outdoor market with the Draytons, the McKennas see a man being chased by police. After being stabbed in the back, the man approaches Ben, who discovers it is actually Louis in disguise. The dying Bernard whispers that a foreign statesman will be assassinated in London soon, and that Ben must tell the authorities there about \"Ambrose Chappell\". Lucy offers to return Hank to the hotel while the police question Ben and Jo. An officer explains that Louis was a French Intelligence agent on assignment in Morocco. | Ben is told via a phone call that Hank has been kidnapped but will not be harmed if the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's warning. | In London, Scotland Yard's Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman) tells them Louis was trying to uncover an assassination plot, and that they should contact him if they hear from the kidnappers. Leaving friends in their hotel suite, the McKennas search for a man named \"Ambrose Chappell\" and find \"Ambrose Chapel\", where Drayton is leading a service. Ben confronts Drayton and is knocked out and locked in the chapel. The Draytons take Hank to a foreign embassy just before Jo arrives with police at the now-deserted chapel. Jo learns that Buchanan has gone to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. There, she sees the sinister man who came to her door in Morocco. When he threatens to harm Hank if she interferes, she realizes that he is the assassin sent to kill the foreign Prime Minister (Alexis Bobrinskoy) at the concert. | Ben escapes and follows Jo to the Hall, where she points out the assassin. Ben searches the balcony boxes for the killer, who is waiting for a cymbal crash to mask his gunshot. Jo screams and the assassin misses his mark, merely wounding his target. Ben struggles with the would-be killer, who falls to his death from the balcony. | The grateful Prime Minister invites the McKennas to the embassy, where they learn that the Draytons and Hank are also there. The ambassador (Mogens Wieth) himself organized the plot to kill the Prime Minister. | The Prime Minister asks Jo to sing. She loudly performs \"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\", so that Hank will hear her. Lucy is guarding Hank, but tells him to whistle along with the song, and Ben finds him. Drayton tries to escape with them at gunpoint, but when Ben hits him, he falls and dies accidentally. | The McKennas return to their hotel room. Ben explains to their now-sleeping friends, \"I'm sorry we were gone so long, but we had to go over and pick up Hank.\"","m_cast":"James Stewart – Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" McKenna | Doris Day – Josephine Conway \"Jo\" McKenna | Brenda De Banzie – Lucy Drayton | Bernard Miles – Edward Drayton | Ralph Truman – Inspector Buchanan | Daniel Gélin – Louis Bernard | Mogens Wieth – Ambassador | Alan Mowbray – Val Parnell | Hillary Brooke – Jan Peterson | Christopher Olsen – Henry \"Hank\" McKenna | Reggie Nalder – Rien | Alexis Bobrinskoy – the Prime Minister | Richard Wattis – Assistant Manager | Noel Willman – Woburn | Alix Talton – Helen Parnell | Yves Brainville – Police Inspector | Richard Wordsworth – Ambrose Chappell, Jr. | George Howe – Ambrose Chappell, Sr. | Carolyn Jones – Cindy Fontaine | John Barrard - Taxidermist (uncredited)[5] | Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In The Man Who Knew Too Much he can be seen 25:42 into the film, in the lower left corner, watching acrobats in the Moroccan marketplace, with his back to the camera, wearing a light gray suit, and putting his hands into his pockets, just before the spy is killed.","m_reception":"The film was a commercial success. Filmed on a budget of $1.2 million, it grossed $11,333,333 at the domestic box office,[1] earning $4.1 million in US theatrical rentals.[11]","m_production":"Alfred Hitchcock first considered an American remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1941, but only brought back the idea in 1956, to make a film that would fulfill a contractual demand from Paramount Pictures. The studio agreed it was a picture that could be well-adapted to the new decade. Screenwriter John Michael Hayes was hired on the condition that he would not watch the early version or read its script, with all the plot details coming from a briefing with Hitchcock.[6]:167 Only the opening scenes of the script were ready when filming begun, and Hayes had to send by airmail the subsequent script pages as he finished them.[6]:187–191 | Hitchcock again brought James Stewart to be his protagonist as he was considering the actor a creative partner, and Paramount wanted a sense of continuity between his works. The director requested blonde Doris Day for the main female role as he liked her performance in Storm Warning, though associate producer Herbert Coleman was reluctant on Day, whom he only knew as a singer. Coleman strongly suggested that the more serious blonde actresses like Lana Turner, Grace Kelly, or Kim Novak be cast in the role, or a suitable brunette, like Jane Russell, Gene Tierney, or Ava Gardner. However, Day was eventually cast in the female lead. | The film started its principal photography on location in Marrakesh, where the schedule had to be changed so the Marrakesh shoot did not coincide with Ramadan.[citation needed] Day was shocked by the health of the local animals, prompting her to only accept filming once the studio set up an animal-feeding station in Marrakesh.[citation needed] Afterwards, production moved to London, with external shots, and the interiors of both the taxidermist shop and the Royal Albert Hall. Once the external shoots were finished, the other interiors – which included a replica of most of the Albert Hall – were shot in the Paramount soundstages in Los Angeles. The Albert Hall sequence drew some inspiration from H. M. Bateman's comic \"The One-Note Man\", which followed the daily life of a musician who only plays one note in a symphony, similar to the cymbal player in the film.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"story by Charles Bennett D.
