W. Pabst. It was produced by Seymour Nebenzal's Nero-Film for Tonbild-Syndikat AG (Tobis), Berlin and Warner Bros. Pictures GmbH, Berlin. The film is loosely based on the 1928 musical theatre success The Threepenny Opera by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. As was usual in the early sound film era, Pabst also directed a French language version of the film, L'Opéra de quat'sous, with some variation of plot details (the French title literally translates as \"the four penny opera\"). A planned English version was not made. The two existing versions were released by The Criterion Collection on home video. | The Threepenny Opera differs in significant respects from the play and the internal timeline is somewhat vague.
