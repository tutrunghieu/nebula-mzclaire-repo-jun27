{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jean Brodie (Maggie Smith) is a teacher in the junior-aged section of the Marcia Blaine School for Girls in Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1930s. Brodie is known for her tendency to stray from the hard knowledge of the school's curriculum, to romanticize fascist leaders like Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco, and to believe herself to be in the prime of life. Brodie devotes her time and energy to her four special 12-year-old junior school girls, called the Brodie Set: Sandy (Pamela Franklin), Monica (Shirley Steedman), Jenny (Diane Grayson) and Mary (Jane Carr). | The set often go to art museums, theatre, concerts, have picnics on the school lawn, among other things, which rather upsets the school's austere headmistress, Emmeline Mackay (Celia Johnson), who dislikes the fact that the girls are cultured to the exclusion of hard knowledge, and the Brodie girls seem precocious for their age. She also seems to have a running grudge against Brodie, who has tenure and had been at Marcia Blaine for six years prior to Mackay being appointed headmistress. Miss Brodie boasts to her girls that the only way she will stop teaching is if she is assassinated. | Besides working with her girls, Jean catches the eye of music teacher/church choirmaster Gordon Lowther (Gordon Jackson), with whom she and her girls spend a lot of time at his home in Cramond, a seaside village on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Brodie sometimes spends the night with Mr. Lowther, although she tries to conceal this from the girls. Mr. Lowther wants to get married, but Brodie drags her feet. She still has feelings for her married ex-lover, Teddy Lloyd (Robert Stephens), who is the art teacher in the senior section of the school. | Also working with Brodie (and all somewhat disapproving of her unorthodox teaching methods and her influence on the girls) are Miss Campbell (Margo Cunningham), the physical education teacher; Miss Ellen (Helena Gloag) and Miss Allison Kerr (Molly Weir), two sisters who serve as the school's sewing teachers; Miss McKenzie (Isla Cameron), the strict librarian; and Miss Gaunt (Ann Way), the headmistress's mouselike, non-talking secretary. Miss Gaunt's brother is a deacon at Mr. Lowther's church who eventually asks for his resignation as church organist and elder because of his relationship with Miss Brodie. | Over a number of years, Miss Brodie rises to her apex, but then spectacularly falls, given that Miss Mackay and most of the other teachers and staff at the very conservative school don't want her to continue teaching there. During her downfall, she loses Mr. Lowther, who gets engaged to Miss Lockhart (Rona Anderson), the chemistry teacher in the Senior School, and one of the few teachers at Marcia Blaine who tended to be more sympathetic towards Miss Brodie as a person and to her teaching style. | As the Brodie Set grow older and become students in the Senior School, Miss Brodie begins to cast her spell over a new group of junior students, particularly a girl called Clara who reminds her of her favourite, Jenny. While Mary, Monica and Jenny become closer friends, Sandy becomes slightly distant from the set, although she is still part of it. | Miss Brodie tries to manoeuvre Jenny and Mr. Lloyd into having an affair, and Sandy into spying on them for her. However, it is actually Sandy (who grows resentful of Miss Brodie's constant praise of Jenny's beauty) who has an affair with Mr. Lloyd. Sandy ends the affair because of Mr. Lloyd's overwhelming obsession with Miss Brodie. | Mary, influenced by Brodie, sets out to Spain to join her brother, who she believes is fighting for Franco. She is killed when her train is attacked shortly after crossing the frontier. This event serves as the last straw for Sandy, who betrays Miss Brodie's efforts to impose her politics on her students to the school's board of governors, who finally decide to terminate Miss Brodie's employment. | Sandy confronts Miss Brodie on her crimes, most especially her manipulation of Mary, her part in her senseless death (for which she is unapologetic) and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls, adding that Mary's brother is actually fighting for the Spanish Republicans. Miss Brodie, on her part, makes some harsh but astute comments about Sandy's character, particularly her ability to coldly judge and destroy others. Sandy retorts that Brodie professed to be an admirer of conquerors and then finally walks out of her classroom, with a frantic Miss Brodie following her to the landing screaming \"Assassin!!\" at Sandy. | After the confrontation, Sandy, Monica, and Jenny graduate along with the other girls. Despite knowing full well that she had betrayed Brodie to Mackay and the board of governors, Sandy did so out of concern for any other girl who could have been a target of Miss Brodie and her fanatical ways, and, perhaps too, resentment over Miss Brodie's preference for Jenny and Teddy Lloyd's unending obsession with Miss Brodie. | As Sandy leaves the school for the last time, her face streaked with angry and bitter tears, Miss Brodie (in voiceover) states her motto: \"Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders, and all my pupils are the crème de la crème. Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life.\"","m_cast":"Maggie Smith as Jean Brodie | Robert Stephens as Teddy Lloyd | Pamela Franklin as Sandy | Gordon Jackson as Gordon Lowther | Celia Johnson as Miss Mackay | Diane Grayson as Jenny | Jane Carr as Mary McGregor | Shirley Steedman as Monica McLaren | Lavinia Lang as Emily Carstairs | Antoinette Biggerstaff as Helen McPhee | Margo Cunningham as Miss Campbell | Isla Cameron as Miss McKenzie | Rona Anderson as Miss Lockhart | Ann Way as Miss Gaunt | Molly Weir as Miss Allison Kerr | Helena Gloag as Miss Ellen Kerr | Heather Seymour as Clara | There were two married couples in the cast: Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens, and Gordon Jackson and Rona Anderson.","m_reception":"Upon its initial release, the film received positive feedback from critics.
