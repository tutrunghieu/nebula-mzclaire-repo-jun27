{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Two Supreme Court justices are assassinated by the professional assassin \"Sam\" Khamel (Stanley Tucci). | Tulane University Law School student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) writes a legal brief detailing her theory on why they were killed and under whose orders. She delivers it to her law professor, mentor and lover Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepard). He gives a copy to his friend Gavin Verheek (John Heard); a lawyer at the FBI. | Callahan is killed by a car bomb; Darby escapes because she refuses to enter the car with her drunk lover and is subsequently attacked by an unknown assailant. Realizing that her brief was accurate, she goes into hiding and reaches out to Verheek for dire assistance. | Political reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) is contacted by an informant claiming to be \"Garcia\" with information about the assassinations. \"Garcia\" suddenly disappears and Darby contacts Grantham, mentioning her brief; Grantham discovers the information Darby discloses has validity. | Darby finds out her computer, disks and files have disappeared. Soon after, she is attacked again but manages to escape. She contacts Verheek and arranges to meet him, but he is murdered by Khamel who continues to the meeting impersonating Verheek. Before Khamel can kill her, he is shot and killed by an unknown agent. | Darby contacts Grantham again and agrees to meet him in New York City. There she gives him the details of her brief. | The legal brief speculates the assassins were loyal to Victor Mattiece, an oil tycoon who wants to drill for oil on a Louisiana marshland, a known habitat of an endangered species of brown pelicans. A court case on appeal is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court. The two slain justices have a history of environmentalism; their only common view. Intelligently, Darby surmised Mattiece hoped to turn the case in his favor by eliminating the two Justices. Grantham tells her about \"Garcia\" and together they discover \"Garcia\" is Curtis Morgan (Jake Weber), a lawyer in the oil and gas division of White & Blazevich in Washington. | Darby visits White & Blazevich while pretending to have an appointment with Morgan. She is told he had been killed and suspects this was related to the information known to him. She and Grantham visit his widow who gives them a key to a safe deposit box. | Darby visits the bank to retrieve the contents of the box. After barely escaping death by a car bomb, they reach the Washington Herald building where they review the documents and a videotape recovered from Morgan's box. The tape confirms Morgan's discovery that Mattiece ordered the assassination of the Justices and the documents confirm the accusations. With this evidence, Grantham writes his story. He gives the FBI a chance to comment and FBI Director Voyles (James B. Sikking) confirms the Pelican Brief was delivered to the White House. Off the record, he reveals the President ordered the FBI to \"back off\", CIA agents were investigating Mattiece and one of them killed Khamel to save Darby's life. A plane is arranged for Darby to flee the country. | The movie ends with Darby at her hideaway watching a TV interview of Grantham where it is revealed that Mattiece and four of his lawyers and aides have been indicted in federal court, the President's chief of staff has resigned and the President himself will not run for office again. Grantham deflects speculation that Darby is fictional, but does agree that she is \"almost\" too good to be true. Darby smiles as the screen cuts to black.","m_cast":"Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) - second year Tulane University Law School student; author of the brief | Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) - reporter for the fictional Washington Herald | Fletcher Cole (Tony Goldwyn) - White House Chief of Staff | Khamel \"Sam\" (Stanley Tucci) - hired assassin | Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepard) - Tulane law school professor; romantically involved with Darby Shaw | Gavin Verheek (John Heard) - lawyer, special counsel to the FBI director; friend to Thomas Callahan | F.
