{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Student Bodies is about a serial killer who stalks female students at Lamab High School, while at the same time, voyeuristically watching them. The killer calls himself \"The Breather,\" presumably because the killer is always breathing heavily. | The Breather enjoys stalking victims over the telephone and much like Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th films, he hates seeing youngsters having sex. The Breather uses many unusual objects to kill his female victims such as a paper clip, a chalkboard eraser, and a horse-head bookend. He kills his male victims by placing them in trash bags alive. | The film itself ends with several twists: initially, it is revealed that the Principal and his elderly female assistant are working as a duo as \"The Breather\", even though they are shown at one point in the film in the same room as other characters when the Breather contacts the school to threaten to commit further murders. The film then goes to reveal that the entire film was a fevered dream, caused by the main character Toby being sick and consumed by overwhelming sexual repression. In a send-up of The Wizard of Oz, many characters are revealed to be much the opposite of what they appeared to be for the bulk of the film: the jock-like shop instructor is really the school's French teacher, the stuck-up would-be prom queen is actually the school nerd (who is given the crown by Toby after she wakes up, due to her kind nature), the two handicapped kids turn out to be able-bodied, and a local ROTC cadet is a hippie. | After being released from the hospital, Toby and her boyfriend are about to have sex, at which point he puts on gloves similar to the ones worn by the Breather and strangles Toby, as he has lost respect for her. However, in a homage to the nightmare-ending of Carrie, Toby's hands rise up from the freshly dug grave after her funeral to attack her killer.","m_cast":"Kristen Riter as Toby Badger | Matt Goldsby as Hardy | Cullen Chambers as Charles Ray | Jerry Belson as The Breather (credited as Richard Brando) | Joe Flood as Mr. Dumpkin | Joe Talarowski as Principal Harlow Hebrew Peters | Mimi Weddell as Miss Mumsley | Dario Jones as Mawamba | Carl Jacobs as Dr. Sigmund | Peggy Cooper as Ms. Van Dyke | Janice E.

Some sources say that Ritchie was actually the co-director/writer, and had to take the \"Alan Smithee\" credit due to a strike by the Writer's Guild of America; others maintain that he took said credit to distance himself from the project. Mickey Rose was (and is) also a WGA member and received full credit; this would seem to debunk the \"union problem\" rumors. | Student Bodies contains no graphic violence or foul language—until 26 minutes into the film, when the action is interrupted by a man sitting at a desk. He explains that, in order to achieve an R rating, a film \"must contain full frontal nudity, graphic violence, or an explicit reference to the sex act.\" He intones that R-rated films are by far the most popular, so \"the producers have asked me to take this opportunity to say, 'fuck you'.\" A slide indicating that the film has been indeed given an R rating by the MPAA appears for a few seconds, then the film continues. | The film parodies several slasher and horror films, including Carnival of Souls, Black Christmas, Carrie, Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, The Shining, Friday the 13th, and Prom Night. | One of the film's oddest aspects is a character called Malvert, a creepy-looking janitor (itself a familiar trope in slasher films). Malvert mumbles, does bizarre things like urinate into wastepaper baskets (\"Sometimes Malvert pee red!\" being one the film's more memorable lines), and moves about in a herky-jerky fashion. (At film's end, Malvert is revealed to be something of a sophisticate; when Toby informs him that he was a janitor in her dream, he responds, \"Absurd!\") | Malvert was played by a tall, double-jointed stand-up comedian known only as \"The Stick\", who made no other films; his only other credit seems to be as a guest appearance in the pilot episode on the 1984 TV series Out Of Control. Several online reviews give the film itself a mixed reaction but praise The Stick's performance.[1][2][3] | An obituary from the Corsicana Daily Sun dated May 8, 1989, confirms The Stick's real name as Patrick Boone Varnell, born in Lawton, Oklahoma on January 22, 1941. He died at Medical City Dallas Hospital in Dallas, Texas on May 7, 1989, aged 47. His body was donated to science, by his sister who was a lab technician in Corsicana at the time of his death.[4] | Lamar Consolidated Junior High School in Richmond, Texas – called Lamab in the film (not to be confused with Lamar High School in Houston, Texas which is known for its use in the film Rushmore). Taylor High School in Katy, Texas was used for the film's football stadium, exterior and some interior scenes. The parade scene was filmed in downtown Houston, Texas, on Main Street.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mickey Rose | Michael Ritchie (uncredited)","m_produced_by":"Michael Ritchie (as Allen Smithee)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Kristen Riter | Matt Goldsby | Cullen Chambers","m_music_by":"Gene Hobson","m_cinematography":"Robert Ebinger","m_edited_by":"Kathryn Ruth Hope","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"August 7, 1981 (1981-08-07) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"86 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$5.2 million | Student Bodies is a 1981 comedy film written and directed by Mickey Rose, with an uncredited Michael Ritchie co-directing.
