{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in suburban Las Vegas, 10-year-old Lucas Nickle is tormented by a bully and his gang. In turn, he attacks an anthill with a squirt gun which terrifies the ants. An eccentric wizard named Zoc tries to fight back but is overwhelmed. His girlfriend, a nurse named Hova attempts to communicate with Lucas, but is saved by Zoc. The leaders of the colony decide to use a potion created by Zoc, to shrink Lucas down to ant size to punish him, for destruction of their hill. | His parents go to Puerto Vallarta for the weekend, leaving him with his older sister, Tiffany, and their grandmother, who is obsessed with aliens. | The local exterminator, Stan Beals convinces Lucas to sign a contract to kill vermin. At night, Zoc and a small troop of ants sneak up and pour the potion into Lucas's ear and when he wakes up being shrunk down to ant size. He is carried to the anthill into a world of giant caves, caterpillars, and ants. During the trial, Zoc insists that he should be studied then eaten, but he is overruled by the Queen. She sentences him to hard labor. Hova volunteers to train him, much to Zoc's objections. They become friends learning more about differences between ants and humans. But when she forces him to forage for jelly beans with Kreela and her husband, Fugax, he ends up unsuccessful. The ants are attacked by wasps. Lucas finds a discarded firecracker and uses it to destroy the attacker wasp and scare the other ones away. The ants begin to admire Lucas, except for Zoc, who grows jealous of him. | By nightfall, Lucas is introduced to honeydew and quickly becomes sick only to be cured by Hova. They wander in the chamber of ages where he is shown a painting which depicts the Great Ant Mother and the evil Cloudbreather. He is told that the Great Ant Mother will return and shower the ants with honeydew, while the Cloudbreather will spell destruction for them. He and his friends go back to his house, where he tries to call Stan to cancel the contract but calls a pizza restaurant instead. Then Tiffany comes home and they are forced to escape down the kitchen sink's drain. | When Zoc finds out that Lucas put Hova in possible danger, he accuses him of treachery and tells him that he should find another wizard because there is no way that he will give him the potion to return him back to normal size. Hova berates with Zoc for what he had done to Lucas and convinces him 'A Wizard Knows No Such Word' that made him lost love for Hova. Lucas was eaten by a frog, with Hova, Kreela, and Fugax in pursuit, but Zoc frees him and returns. Zoc explains that ants work for the benefit of the colony. Lucas states that most humans work for personal gain. | The next morning, Lucas finds the Great Ant Mother approaching. He discovers that it is actually a giant balloon strapped to the top of Stan Beals' van used as a symbol for pest control. The ants enlist the aid of the wasps to stop Stan for aiding chaos. They threaten Lucas, but hearing that their hill will be destroyed by Stan, they agree to help. During the battle with Stan, Lucas saves the lives of Hova and an injured wasp. Both the ants and wasps are no match against pesticide, but just as Stan is about to exterminate the anthill, a beetle and glowworm manage to bite him in the crotch. Lucas injects him with a shrinking potion, misshaping him, and forcing him to escape on a tricycle. The group returns to the colony, where Lucas is hailed as a hero for his brave actions. Zoc, having understood who he is, gives him the potion and he returns to his normal size. His parents return from their trip and reunites with him. He managed to beat the bigger bully by getting the other Kronies to join him and be \"bigger\" than the bully, while his former ones become his friends. Before leaving he gives a bag of jelly beans to the colony.","m_cast":"Zach Tyler Eisen as Lucas Nickle (known to the ants as Peanut The Destroyer), a clever boy whose family has moved into a new neighborhood where he gets tortured by a bully.

The website's consensus reads, \"Sometimes inventive and witty, this animated adventure into an ant-sized world is a pleasant diversion.\"[7] Tom Long of the Detroit News wrote that \"there's a sweet simplicity and humility to this film.\" Ruthe Stein of The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \"the brilliance of The Ant Bully is in the crafty way it delves into the minds of ants as they plot to save themselves from extermination...Davis creates a marvelously labyrinthine society for them, right below the surface of a bland suburb.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly liked Roberts and Cage in their roles, and referred to Streep's queen ant as \"excellently magisterial.\" She also wrote that \"the kind of life lessons that usually gum up the fun go down as easily as jelly beans in The Ant Bully.\"[8] However, Jeffrey E. McCants of the Minneapolis Star Tribune wrote that \"the film's heavy-handed lessons turn it from a fun romp through a cartoonish insect world to a predictable and preachy snoozefest\". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called the film \"generic\" and wrote that \"adults will be less than enchanted by its preachiness, talkiness and Communist Party-line political views\". Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic wrote that \"The Ant Bully, in trying to match Antz or A Bug's Life, just digs itself into a big hole\".[9] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News was positive about the film's lack of pop culture references and thought that the film does not \"talk down\" to children. Additionally, he noted that \"adults may be amused (or maybe not) by the Christian parallel in the ants' religion.\"[10] | The film opened at #5 on July 28, 2006 and closed on November 16, 2006, with $28 million in North America and a total of $55 million worldwide. The estimated production budget was $50 million.[11]","m_production":"Hanks originally conceived the idea for an animated film adaptation after reading the book with his child. He then sent a copy to Davis because of Davis' work on the computer-animated film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.[2] Davis came up with a potential take on the story within a few days. \"To be honest, when I first looked at it, I thought Oh, why does it have to be ants again?\" said Davis. \"But the more I thought about it, I said, So what? It's got as much to do with The Incredible Shrinking Man as it does the other bug movies. It's a completely different story.\"[3] Also, Hanks agreed that the story could be expanded considerably (the original book being around only 2,000 words). Alcorn had a similar initial reaction to the project as Davis did. \"My first thought,\" recalled Alcorn, \"was, 'not another ant movie.' But looking at the actual story, this was really about a little boy and how he learns about the world by having to live beneath the surface.\"[4] Davis states that he felt like something of a hypocrite when, while he was working on the script, carpenter ants infested his house and he called an exterminator.[5] The film was rendered on DNA Productions' 1400-CPU render farm, managed by the open source Sun Grid Engine job scheduler. The nodes started out with Fedora Core 2 Linux with a modern 2.6.x kernel, but the new AMD Opteron nodes are running Fedora Core 4. Most of the applications are commercial, including Maya, Lightwave 3D, Houdini, Massive and the Pixar RenderMan.[6] Along with the theatrical release of The Ant Bully, there was an IMAX 3D version presented in only some of the IMAX theaters. The others continued to run the 3D version of Superman Returns. The special IMAX 3D version was remastered in 3D with IMAX DMR. Critics within the 3D motion picture community have given the film high marks, as unlike Superman Returns, the entire film is projected in 3D stereo. The process to turn a pure animation film into 3D is much simpler than converting a film having live actors. Some of the production took place at C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures in Canada.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Ant Bully  by John Nickle","m_directed_by":"John A. Davis","m_produced_by":"Tom Hanks Gary Goetzman John A.
