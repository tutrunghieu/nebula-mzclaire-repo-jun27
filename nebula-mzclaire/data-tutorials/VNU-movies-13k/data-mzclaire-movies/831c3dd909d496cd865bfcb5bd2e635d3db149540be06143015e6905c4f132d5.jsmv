In this alternative reality, it is a large underclass of European Americans who live in rundown, crime-infested ghettos and face prejudice from the broader society, while the comfortable middle and upper class is predominantly African American. | In an effort to go above and beyond in his position (hoping to become a foreman soon), in the candy factory in which he works, Pinnock delivers a package for his boss to successful CEO Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte). After Pinnock accidentally sees Thomas's wife coming out of the shower, he is subsequently dismissed from his job, assaulted by the police and forced to watch his family evicted. In a radical quest for justice, Pinnock kidnaps Thomas, which forces the two men to bond, as well as argue over race relations and the roots of social inequality.","m_cast":"John Travolta as Louis Pinnock | Harry Belafonte as Thaddeus Thomas | Kelly Lynch as Marsha Pinnock | Margaret Avery as Megan Thomas | Tom Bower as Stanley | Andrew Lawrence as Donnie Pinnock | Bumper Robinson as Martin | Tom Wright as Lionel | Sheryl Lee Ralph as Roberta | Judith Drake as Dorothy | Robert Gossett as John | Wesley Thompson as Williams | Tom Nolan as Johansson | Willie C.
