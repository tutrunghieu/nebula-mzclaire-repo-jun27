{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In an unnamed city in a time period that resembles the 1950s, Ellen Aim (Lane), lead singer of Ellen Aim and The Attackers, has returned home to give a concert. The Bombers, a biker gang, led by Raven Shaddock (Dafoe), kidnap Ellen. | Witnessing this is Reva Cody (Van Valkenburgh), who hires her brother Tom Cody (Paré), an ex-soldier and Ellen's ex-boyfriend, to rescue her. Tom returns and checks out the local tavern, the Blackhawk. He is annoyed by a tomboyish ex-soldier named McCoy (Madigan), a mechanic who \"could drive anything\" and who is good with her fists. They leave the bar and later Tom hires McCoy to be his driver. That night, Tom and Reva plan to rescue Ellen; Reva contacts Billy Fish (Moranis), Ellen's manager and current boyfriend. | While Reva and McCoy go to a diner to wait for Billy, Tom acquires a cache of weapons, including a pump action shotgun, a revolver, and a lever action rifle. Tom and Billy meet at the diner and Tom agrees to the rescue for $10,000, and that Billy goes with Tom back into \"the Battery\" to get Ellen. | In the Battery, they visit Torchie's, where Billy used to book bands. They wait until nightfall under an overpass, watching bikers come and go. Raven has Ellen tied up in an upstairs bedroom. As Tom, Billy, and McCoy approach, Tom directs Billy to get the car and be out front in fifteen minutes. | McCoy enters and is stopped by one of the \"Bombers\". McCoy, pretending to like him, follows him to his special \"party room,\" close to where Raven is playing poker. McCoy knocks him out. Tom finds a window and, as a distraction, starts shooting the gas tanks on the gang's motorcycles; he then reaches Ellen's room, cuts her free and, with McCoy's help, escapes just as Billy arrives at the front door. | Riding in the convertible, Tom sends his crew off to meet at the Grant Street Overpass,and leaves to blow up the gas pumps outside a bar. Raven appears out of the flames and chaos to confront Tom. After learning who he is, Raven warns he will be back for Ellen and for him, too. Tom escapes on the one intact motorcycle. Billy is persuading Ellen the only reason her ex-boyfriend rescued her was for money. Tom returns as McCoy explains to Billy that Tom used to be Ellen's boyfriend. | Ellen follows Tom, while Billy and McCoy go back and forth once again about Tom and Ellen's love affair. Ellen and Tom also have an argument. When they all meet up on the street, they are in \"the Battery\". They return Ellen safely home where she initially rejects her home town as well as Tom. Later, he goes to the hotel where Ellen and Billy are staying to collect his reward. He only takes McCoy's cut and throws the rest in Billy's face. He then tells Ellen that there was a time he would've done anything for her but no more. As Tom storms out, Ellen follows and the two embrace in the rain. | Meanwhile, Raven informs Officer Ed Price (Lawson), the head of the police department, that he wants Tom to meet him alone. If he agrees he will leave the Richmond alone. Price tells Tom to get out of town. Tom, Ellen, and McCoy leave on a train. He knocks out Ellen and returns to town for a climactic fight with Raven. Tom defeats Raven and the defeated gang carries their leader away. Later that night, Tom says a final goodbye to Ellen and rides off with McCoy.","m_cast":"Michael Paré: Tom Cody | Diane Lane: Ellen Aim | E.G.

Afterwards, Gross and Hill worked on the screenplay, writing ten pages a day. When they were finished, they submitted the script to Universal executive Bob Rehme on a Friday (in January 1983) and by the end of the weekend, the studio had given them the go-ahead to make the film. This was the fastest ever greenlight Hill had received and he put it down to the box office success of 48 Hours.[4][5][6] | Walter Hill later recalled: | Larry and I wrote it with the idea we were doing a musical fantasy... We wrote it and began production when there was no MTV. By the time it came out, always a problem with movies, the movie was damned as the first MTV movie and condemned... I think we tripped into something which was you could set up - I was always fascinated. The audience will go with you when you set up an abstract world with teenage values and play out a drama within this. It was kind of real but it wasn't really. I always said whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney--esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, that was kind of different at the time... People asked me about STREETS OF FIRE, I always thought of it as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.[7] | The film's title came from a song written and recorded by Bruce Springsteen on his 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town.[8][9] Negotiations with Springsteen for rights to the song delayed production several times.[3] Originally, plans were made for the song to be featured on the film's soundtrack, to be sung by Ellen Aim at the end of the film, but when Springsteen was told that the song would be re-recorded by other vocalists, he withdrew permission for the song to be used.[8] Jim Steinman was brought in to write the opening and closing songs, and \"Streets of Fire\" was replaced by \"Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young\".[3] The studio claimed that they replaced Springsteen's song because it was a \"downer\".[8] | When it came to casting the movie, Hill wanted to go with a young group of relative unknowns. He heard about Michael Paré from the same agent who recommended Eddie Murphy to him for 48 Hrs.[4] At the time he was cast, in March 1983, Paré had appeared in two films, Eddie and the Cruisers and Undercover, which had not yet been released.[10] For Hill, Paré \"had the right quality. He was the only actor I found who was right for the part ...a striking combination of toughness and innocence.\"[4] Paré said of his character, \"He's someone who can come in and straighten everything out.\"[4] However, according to writer Larry Gross, they had initially wanted Tom Cruise for the role of Tom Cody but they \"couldn’t pull the trigger on either deal in the right moment of time.\"[11] | The character of Ellen Aim was written as a 28-year-old woman and Diane Lane read for the part when she was 18.[3] Hill was reluctant to cast her because he felt that she was too young for the role. Hill met Lane in New York City and she auditioned for him in black leather pants, a black mesh top and high-heeled boots. He was surprised with her \"total commitment to selling herself as a rock 'n' roll star\".[3] The actress had been in more than 10 films by the time she did Streets of Fire. She described her character as \"the first glamorous role I've had\".[4] Hill was so impressed with her work on the film that he wrote additional scenes for her during the shoot.[4] Amy Madigan originally read for Reva, Cody's sister, and told Hill and Silver that she wanted to play the role of McCoy which, she remembers, \"was written to be played by an overweight male who was a good soldier and really needed a job. It could still be tough and strong and have a woman do it without rewriting the part.\"[4][5] Hill liked the idea and cast her.[4] | Production began on location in Chicago in April 1983, then moved to Los Angeles for 45 days, and finally two weeks at a soap factory in Wilmington, California, with additional filming taking place at Universal Studios. Shooting wrapped on August 18, 1983.[4] All ten days of filming in Chicago were exteriors at night, on locations that included platforms of elevated subway lines and the depths of Lower Wacker Drive. For Hill, the subways and their look was crucial to the world of the film and represented one of three modes of transportation—the other two being cars and motorcycles.[4] While shooting in Chicago, the production was plagued by inclement weather that included rain, hail, snow, and a combination of all three. The subway scenes were filmed on location in Chicago at many locations, including: LaSalle Street (Blue line), Lake Street (Green line), Sheridan Road (Red, Purple lines), and Belmont Avenue (Red, Brown, and Purple lines). The Damen Avenue stop (Blue Line, at Damen, North, and Milwaukee Avenues) was also used.[4] | Production designer John Vallone and his team constructed an elevated train line on the backlot of Universal Studios that perfectly matched the ones in Chicago.[3] The film crew tarped-in the New Street and Brownstone street sets to double for the Richmond District setting, completely covering them so that night scenes could be filmed during the day. This tarp measured 1,240 feet long by 220 feet wide over both sets, and cost $1.2 million to construct.[3] However, this presented unusual problems. The sound of the tarp flapping in the wind interfered with the actors’ dialogue. Birds who had nested in the tarp provided their own noisy interruptions.[4] | The exterior of the Richmond Theater where Ellen Aim sings at the beginning of the film was shot on the backlot, with the interior done in the Wiltern Theater in L.A. for two weeks.[4] The factory scenes that take place in the Battery were filmed at a rotting soap factory in Wilmington, California, for ten nights. The Ardmore Police roadblock was filmed near 6th street in East Los Angeles, near the flood basin. Though only three districts are seen, the city has a total of five districts: the Richmond, the Strip, the Battery, the Cliffside, and the Bayside.[4] | The production employed 500 extras to play the citizens of the Richmond District.[4] Cinematographer Andrew Laszlo shot the film with very low light, giving the images a stark, \"low-tech\" quality. The choreography for the two songs Ellen Aim sings and the one by the Sorels was done by Jeffrey Hornaday.[4] The lighting for these concert scenes were done by Mark Brickman, who also lit concerts for Bruce Springsteen and Pink Floyd. The car that Cody drives in the movie is a 1951 Mercury that was chopped, channeled, nosed, and decked.[clarification needed] In addition, 12 1950 and 1951 model Studebakers were used as police cars.[4] More than 50 motorcycles and their drivers were featured as the Bombers, and were chosen from 200 members of real L.A.-based clubs like The Crusaders and The Heathens.[3] | According to cinematographer Andrew Laszlo, the film's style was dictated by the story.[3] The Richmond's look was very soft and the colors did not call attention to themselves. The light in The Battery was contrasting and harsh, with vivid colors. Argyle prints and plaids are used in the Parkside District, and neon lights color the Strip.[3] | A massive tent was used to cover the backlot and shoot day for night. It cost $1.2 million.[12] | Walter Hill later said he felt \"humbled\" by the shoot: | I think I thought I could handle things. Didn't know how to shoot music. Music had been important in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem to work it out without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.[7] | Due to the choreography and setups in between takes of every scene, the climactic 4-minute showdown between Cody and Raven took a considerable time to shoot.[3] Paré estimated it as four weeks: | Willem and I shot that for two weeks, and then Walter shot it for another two week with the stunt guys. That whole scene was a Walter thing. He had to do something like that, especially after what he had done in Hard Times (1975).[13] | Michael Paré later recalled: | You gotta realize that, out of the whole cast, nobody was over thirty. Diane Lane was, I think, eighteen. It was an enormous Hollywood production. My manager had me hire a limousine to pick me up at home and take me to work. I was like, \"Jesus, this is incredible. This is... Hollywood. The real Hollywood. The Hollywood they make movies about.\"... It was scary. And Walter isn't the kind of guy who works well with kids. He's a cowboy. He's like John Ford. \"Don't ask me how to act! I'm a director!\" (Laughs)[14] | Paré also said he had troubles with Rick Moranis: | Rick Moranis drove me out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say whatever they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, \"Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?\" That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, \"Oh... this is not going to go well.\" But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.[14] | Paré said that the original draft of the script had Tom Cody kill Raven with a knife. \"Walter really liked the idea, because it had Tom Cody winning at all costs.\" However, this was changed to a fair fight in order to get a PG rating.[13] | Paré did not always work well with Walter Hill: | I think Walter is a writer at heart. Writers aren't always that good at communicating in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and on the back of it read \"Lone Wolf\". He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, \"We need to ADR the love scene.\" I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.[13] | E.G. Daily who played Baby Doll says it was \"a very frustrating thing for me\" to not sing in the film \"Because Diane Lane was singing, and I remember thinking, “Ah!” It was so frustrating for me. It was painful. Because I wanted to be on that stage singing with those guys... But back then I always played those quirky characters. I didn’t get those fancy leads. I got those best friend of the leads, quirky, funny characters. Hookers with a heart of gold. Weirdos. I liked my roles, I just wanted to be singing, too.\"[15]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Walter Hill","m_produced_by":"Lawrence Gordon Joel Silver","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Paré | Diane Lane | Rick Moranis | Amy Madigan","m_music_by":"Ry Cooder","m_cinematography":"Andrew Laszlo","m_edited_by":"James Coblentz Freeman A.

It is described in its opening credits and posters as \"A Rock & Roll Fable\".[2] The film is a mix of musical, action, drama, and comedy, with elements both of retro-1950s and 1980s. It stars Michael Paré as a soldier of fortune who returns home to rescue his ex-girlfriend (Diane Lane) who has been kidnapped by Raven (Willem Dafoe), the leader of a biker gang. Some of the film was shot on the backlot of Universal Studios in California, on two large sets covered in a tarp 1,240 feet long by 220 feet wide, so that night scenes could be filmed during the day. | The film was promoted as a summer blockbuster but failed critically and commercially, grossing only US$8 million in North America, compared to a production budget of $14.5 million. However, its musical score, by Jim Steinman, Ry Cooder, and others, as well as the hit Dan Hartman song \"I Can Dream About You\", from the film's soundtrack, have helped it attain a cult following. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Box office figures for Walter Hill films in France at Box Office Story | ^ Henderson, Odie (1 October 2014). \"Tonight is What Means To Be Young: \"Streets of Fire\" at 30\". rogerebert.com.
