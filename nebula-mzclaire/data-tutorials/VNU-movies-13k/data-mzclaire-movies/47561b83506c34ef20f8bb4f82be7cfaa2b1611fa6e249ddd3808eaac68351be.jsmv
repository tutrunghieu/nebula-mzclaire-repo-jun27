{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Eight years after the death of district attorney Harvey Dent, the Dent Act grants the Gotham City Police Department powers which nearly eradicate organized crime. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels increasingly guilty for covering up the crimes committed by Dent, who was turned into a murderer by the Joker. He writes a resignation speech confessing the truth but decides not to use it. | Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, broken by the death of his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes and has retired as the vigilante Batman after taking the blame for Dent's crimes, as well as Dent's death. Cat burglar Selina Kyle obtains Wayne's fingerprints from his home and kidnaps congressman Byron Gilley. She sells the fingerprints to Phillip Stryver, an assistant to Wayne's business rival John Daggett. In return, she requests her payment: a \"clean slate\" that can wipe all traces of a person from the internet. | Stryver double-crosses Kyle, but she uses Gilley's phone to alert the police to their location. Gordon and the police arrive to find the congressman, and then pursue Stryver's men into the sewers while Selina flees. The police attempt to follow them into the sewers, but the men that enter the sewers are killed, and Gordon is captured, while the rest of the police are assailed down by sniper fire. | The assailants drag Gordon to Bane, a masked mercenary, who has him searched and finds his resignation speech. Gordon escapes and is found by John Blake, a patrol officer. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with Blake reporting directly to him. Bane and multiple accomplices attack the Gotham Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints in a transaction that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth reveals that Rachel had intended to marry Dent before she died. Alfred then resigns in an attempt to convince Bruce to move on from being Batman. | Wayne Enterprises is losing profits after Wayne discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that the core could be weaponized. Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Wayne asks Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate to take over his company. Kyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham with the League of Shadows remnant. He engages Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is virtually impossible. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping—the only prisoner to have ever done so. Wayne assumes the child to be Bane. | Bane lures Gotham police underground and traps them there. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Dr. Leonid Pavel, a Russian nuclear physicist he kidnapped from Uzbekistan six months prior, to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb. Bane uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating anarchy. The wealthy and powerful have their property expropriated, are dragged from their homes, and are given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane, where all are sentenced to death. | After spending months recovering and re-training, Wayne escapes from the prison. He enlists Kyle, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Lucius Fox to help stop the bomb's detonation. He hands the Batpod to Kyle, tasking her with helping people evacuate and saving herself. She asks him to come along, leaving Gotham to its fate, but he refuses. While the police and Bane's forces clash, Batman overpowers Bane. He interrogates Bane for the bomb's trigger, but Tate intervenes and stabs him. She reveals herself to be Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. Bane is her protector, who aided her escape from the prison. She uses the detonator, but Gordon has successfully approached the bomb and blocks her signal, preventing remote detonation. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle returns on the Batpod and saves Batman by killing Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it detonates. | In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Wayne also presumed dead, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage, and his remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Wayne had fixed the Bat's autopilot and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished. Alfred finds that Wayne is alive and well, together with Selina, while visiting Florence. Blake resigns from the police force and discovers the Batcave and its contents.","m_cast":"Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman: | Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth:[12] | Gary Oldman as Commissioner James Gordon:[12] | Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle / Catwoman:[14][15] | Tom Hardy as Bane:[14] | Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate / Talia al Ghul: | Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Sgt.

Viewing it as an ending, that sets you very much on the right track about the appropriate conclusion.\" | Warner Bros. president of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film would be released in 2011 or 2012.[53] Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. \"On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question,\" he reasoned, \"how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?\"[54] Nolan said that he never even thought a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy.[55] Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary.[56] By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception.[57] Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors.[58] Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.[59] | Following the success of the Joker in The Dark Knight, studio executives wished for the Riddler to be included as the primary villain as he was considered a similar character and encouraged the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.[60] However, Nolan wanted the antagonist to be vastly different from the previous incarnations and committed to using Bane instead,[60] citing the need for a character with a physical presence within the film.[61] He was initially unfamiliar with the character's back-story,[20] but pointed out the appeal of an archetype, labelling it as \"the extreme of some type of villainy\". When comparing the choice of Bane with the Joker, Nolan highlighted the Joker as an example of \"diabolical, chaotic anarchy and has a devilish sense of humor\", juxtaposing him against Bane, whom he likened to \"a classic movie monster [...] with a terrific brain.\"[61] Nolan has said that his draft of the script was inspired by Charles Dickens' 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, which centers around the French Revolution.[62] This homage to Dickens was briefly illustrated by having Bane inconspicuously finger knit paracord in the film, symbolizing his literary character Madame Defarge, and more overtly by Commissioner Gordon's eulogy for Bruce Wayne at the end of the film, which is taken directly from the classic book.[62] | It was not until February 9, 2010, that it was announced that Nolan had \"cracked\" the story of a sequel to The Dark Knight and was committed to return to the project.[63] Shortly afterward, it was announced David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan were working on a screenplay.[64] Goyer would leave the project during pre-production to begin work on Man of Steel; Jonathan continued writing the script based on the story by his brother Chris and Goyer.[12] Chris Nolan said that his brother's original draft was about 400 pages.[65] The film's storyline has been compared with the Batman comic book series' story arc \"Knightfall\" (1993), which showcased Bane; the mini-series The Dark Knight Returns (1986), in which Batman returns to Gotham City after a ten-year absence; and the story arc \"No Man's Land\" (1999), which depicts a Gotham cut off from the rest of the world and overrun by gangs.[66][67] The nickname \"the Dark Knight\" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.[68][69] Nolan confirmed the Joker would not return in the third film, and dismissed rumors that he considered using unused footage of Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight.[70] The Dark Knight Rises reunited Nolan with many of his past collaborators, including cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Lee Smith, costume designer Lindy Hemming, special effects supervisors Paul Franklin and Chris Corbould, and composer Hans Zimmer.[71] | During location scouting in December 2010, Nolan began searching for locations such as India, Romania, and Michigan.[72][73][74] According to the Romania Insider, Nolan was interested in Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine.[72] The film had an estimated budget of $250–300 million, coming down to about $230 million after tax credits.[3] Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated that he intended to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format.[75] The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes).[76][77] Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues.[77] Wally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX,[78] but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35mm and 70mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes,[77][79] as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras.[80] Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX planned to run the film in its theatres for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks.[81] Nolan also bypassed the use of a digital intermediate for the film, resulting in less manipulation of the filmed image and higher film resolution.[82] | Filming was scheduled to start in May and conclude in November 2011.[83] Principal photography commenced on May 6, 2011, in Jodhpur, India at the Mehrangarh Fort[84][85][86] before moving to Pittsburgh, where it operated under the working title Magnus Rex to reduce the visibility of the production.[87][88] Shooting locations within the city included Heinz Field, the site of an American football game,[89] with members of the Pittsburgh Steelers playing the Gotham Rogues football team. More than 11,000 extras were used to depict the shot sequence.[7][45][46] Filming in Pittsburgh also took place at the Mellon Institute and Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.[88] A letter sent out to residents and business owners detailing road closures revealed that the streets of the city would be featured \"as the start of [the] film\".[90] 9-1-1 operators were told to expect an increase in calls related to gunshots and explosions in the film's production.[91] The Pittsburgh leg of production wrapped after three weeks on August 21, 2011.[92] The next portion of the filming began in Los Angeles in late August and finished up on October 23 after nine weeks of filming. New York and New Jersey were the next places of filming. The Trump Tower replaced the Richard J. Daley Center as the location for the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises.[93] In November 2011, shooting shifted to Newark, New Jersey.[94][95] Newark City Hall and Military Park were among the locations used for filming.[96] Other shooting locations include London and Glasgow, the latter of which was used for \"additional exterior filming\".[97] Principal photography concluded on November 14, 2011.[98] The external waterfall scene at the end of the film was shot at Sgwd Henrhyd falls, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales.[99] | Production photos from filming in Pittsburgh showed a second Tumbler chassis after the first was destroyed, indicating that a new Batmobile would be in the film, following the destruction of the first in The Dark Knight.[100] Further set photos revealed a \"new vehicle\" being transported to Wabash Tunnel, prompting speculation as to its nature.[101] In June 2011, Autoblog confirmed the presence of the new Lamborghini Aventador on the film set.[102] | Several accidents occurred during the production of the film. While filming at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, a tractor-trailer crashed into the main entrance, though no one was injured.[103] A stuntman parachutist later crashed through the roof of a home in Cairngorm Gliding Club, Feshiebridge in Scotland, and became wedged there after a failed landing during a skydiving stunt; he was not seriously injured.[104] While filming scenes in Pittsburgh, Hathaway's stunt double crashed into an IMAX camera while filming a sequence that required her to ride a Batpod down a flight of stairs during a riot. There were no injuries, but the camera was destroyed.[105] A second accident took place in Pittsburgh when the truck carrying the then-unidentified vehicle later termed \"the Bat\" went off-course and crashed into a lighting array, damaging the model of the aircraft. Production was delayed while the model was repaired.[106] | Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several prominent directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre for a private screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling that the use of film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option.[107][108] Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"[107] | Costume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\".[7][109][110] Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.[7] Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.[7] The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.[111] | The Batsuit consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since The Dark Knight.[7] | In creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being polyurethane coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.[7] | Concept artist Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of cinematography when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film.\"[citation needed] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"[112] | The film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache.[7] Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.[7][113][114] | When designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.[7] Another set was designed at Cardington as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a 120 foot (37 m) vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the \"forbidding landscape added to the desolation\".[7] | In an interview in October 2010, composer Hans Zimmer confirmed that he would be returning to score The Dark Knight Rises. James Newton Howard was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of Inception would make him seem like a \"third wheel\".[115] Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.[7] | The film features a prevalent Moroccan chant of the phrase deshi basara (proper transliteration: Tījī basara’ah) (Arabic: تيجي بسرعة), which translates to \"rise up\" (literally: \"come quickly\").[116][117] In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score.[118][119] When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.\"[120]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters appearing in comic books published  by DC Comics","m_directed_by":"Christopher Nolan","m_produced_by":"Emma Thomas | Christopher Nolan | Charles Roven","m_screenplay_by":"Jonathan Nolan | Christopher Nolan","m_story_by":"Christopher Nolan | David S.

Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008). Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of allies: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The film introduces Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), and Bane (Tom Hardy). Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, merciless revolutionary Bane forces an older Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction. | Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a second time, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"Knightfall\" storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline \"No Man's Land\". Filming took place in locations including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot. | The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, 2012, and in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. It received positive reviews from critics, many of whom named it one of the best films of 2012.[5] Like its predecessor, the film grossed over $1 billion worldwide at the box office, making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion. It is currently the 16th-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the fourth-highest-grossing superhero film of all time. |  | ","m_marketing":"The official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote The Dark Knight. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.[121] | In July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[122] The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of Slate wrote it successfully built hype,[122] while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the Inception trailer.[123] The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.[124][125][126] Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of income inequality and an \"Occupy Gotham\" campaign within the world of the story.[127][128][129] Receiving more than 12.5 million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from iTunes, beating the previous record held by The Avengers.[130] However, the second trailer for The Avengers again set the record with 13.7 million downloads.[131] Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for The Dark Knight Rises to theatrical prints of The Avengers. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see—and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\"[132] Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of The Avengers.[133] | Continuing a method used with The Dark Knight whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of I Am Legend seven months before release,[134] a six-minute prologue of The Dark Knight Rises was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, again approximately seven months before release.[135] Critical reaction to the prologue was positive,[136][137][138] with one critic commenting that \"no one gets to make a film on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan,\" though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear.[139] Addressing the issue in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"[140] | Viral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies Empire and Wired received \"CIA documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian nuclear physicist, while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted.[29] These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.[136] The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.[141][142] Various websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" T-shirt.[143] In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.[144] | In January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.[145] | At the American International Toy Fair, Mattel unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also released in the \"Movie Masters\" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. Lego released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, Funko released a series of plush toys, Mezco Toyz released vinyl figures, and Hornby released the Batman Tumbler car.[146] Other partners include Jakks Pacific, who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys,[147] and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed Mr. Potato Head.[148] Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.[149] | A video game of the same name was released on the same day as the release of the film for the iOS and Android devices for promoting the movie. The game features an open world with primary focus on stealth and combat. The combat system of the game is inspired from Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. It takes place in Gotham City, with a somewhat similar but still significantly different plot from that of the movie. IGN gave it a mediocre score of 5.5/10.[150] | The film novelization, written by author Greg Cox and published by Titan Books, was released alongside the film on July 24, 2012.[151] | Warner Bros. partnered with Mountain Dew to do a cross-promotion that included a special paint scheme on the number 88 Chevrolet Impala owned by Hendrick Motorsports and driven by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[152] On June 17, 2012, the car won the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway.[153] On July 4, 2012, the studio signed a deal with Formula One team Lotus F1 to have the film's logos appear on the Lotus E20s driven by Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean at the 2012 British Grand Prix.[154] Räikkönen and Grosjean went on to finish the race in fifth and sixth place respectively.[155] Warner Bros. had previously followed a similar promotion at the 2008 British Grand Prix, when the now-defunct Toyota F1 carried a livery to promote The Dark Knight.[156] | Two digital comic books entitled Batman Origins[157] and The Dark Knight: Prologue[158] were released exclusively for Nokia Lumia devices. A special movie application has also been released, featuring trailers, wallpapers, movie schedules and Batman trivias.[159] Limited editions of the Lumia 710, Lumia 800 and Lumia 900 were also released featuring a laser-etched Batman logo.[160][161][162]","m_reference":"^ \"The Dark Knight Rises\".
