In comparison to that other British picture about the same subject that opened [in New York City] last week, this one is more impressive in every respect, save one.\"[4] Crowther concludes the review saying \"The only thing is you wonder if this is a fairly true account, if Mr. Wilde was as noble and heroic as he is made to appear. And if he was, what was he doing with those cheap and shady young men? It looks to us as if they are trying to whitewash a most unpleasant case, which is one of the more notorious and less ennobling in literary history.\"[4] | Variety magazine, commenting on the performances, said \"Peter Finch gives a moving and subtle performance as the ill-starred playwright. Before his downfall he gives the man the charm that he undoubtedly had....John Fraser as handsome young Lord Alfred Douglas is suitably vain, selfish, vindictive and petulant and the relationship between the two is more understandable. Where Trials suffers in comparison with the B&W film is in the remarkable impact of the libel case court sequence. James Mason never provides the strength and bitter logic necessary for the dramatic cut-and-thrust when Wilde is in the witness box.\"[5]","m_production":"The production was filmed in Technirama. It was one of two films about Wilde released in 1960, the other being Oscar Wilde. According to production designer Ken Adam, producer Irving Allen set up four editing rooms for the production, working in parallel during principal photography; the setup permitted the film on the screen in the West End seven weeks after they had started filming.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Ken Hughes","m_produced_by":"Irving Allen Albert R.
