{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Down on his luck, veteran movie director and writer Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart) is reduced to working for abusive, emotionally stunted business tycoon Kirk Edwards (Warren Stevens), who has decided he wants to produce a film to stroke his monumental ego. Looking for a fresh leading lady, they discover, in a Madrid night club, stunning dancer Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner), a blithe but proud spirit who likes to go barefoot and has a troubled home life. | Maria takes an instant dislike to Kirk but trusts Harry, whose work she knows. Thanks to his expertise and the help of sweaty, insincere publicist Oscar Muldoon (Edmond O'Brien), her film debut is a sensation. Kirk tries to control Maria's life by publicly ordering her to stay away from wealthy Latin American playboy Alberto Bravano (Marius Goring), but Maria rebels. | She is a great star, but Maria is not satisfied. She envies the happiness her friend Harry has found with his wife Jerry (Elizabeth Sellars) and wants a prince charming of her own. Alberto is too frivolous and shallow for her. When he berates her in public for supposedly ruining his luck at a gambling table, he receives a slap in the face from a stranger. This turns out to be Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini (Rossano Brazzi), who offers Maria his arm. They walk out. | Maria has found the great love of her life. They wed in a lavish ceremony, but there is a problem. The count and his widowed sister (Valentina Cortese) are the last of the Torlato-Favrinis; without offspring, the noble line will die out. She however is incapable of bearing children while he, because of a war injury, is impotent. He does not tell Maria about this until their wedding night. | Some time later, Harry is in Italy and an unhappy Maria tells him about her husband and confesses that she is pregnant. She believes the count will want this child and plans to tell him about it that night. However, her husband had suspected she was unfaithful and shoots both her and her lover before she could tell him about the child. Harry arrives just as the shots are fired and does not tell the count about the pregnancy. The story ends (as it began) with flashbacks at her funeral.","m_cast":"Humphrey Bogart as Harry Dawes | Ava Gardner as Maria Vargas | Edmond O'Brien as Oscar Muldoon | Marius Goring as Alberto Bravano | Valentina Cortese (billed as Valentina Cortesa) as Eleanora Torlato-Favrini | Rossano Brazzi as Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini | Elizabeth Sellars as Jerry | Warren Stevens as Kirk Edwards | Franco Interlenghi as Pedro Vargas | Mari Aldon as Myrna | Bessie Love as Mrs. Eubanks | Diana Decker as Drunken blonde | Bill Fraser as J.

Bogart had the matter rectified with the addition of a large line drawing of his face. | The film's Italian production was part of the \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" phenomenon.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Joseph L.
