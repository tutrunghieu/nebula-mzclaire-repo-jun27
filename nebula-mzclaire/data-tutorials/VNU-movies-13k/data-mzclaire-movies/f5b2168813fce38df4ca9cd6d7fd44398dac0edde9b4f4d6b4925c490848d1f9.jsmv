And why did it have to do it in such a hackneyed and sentimental way as to grate on the sensibilities of even the most affectionately disposed?\" | Variety began its review with a similar sentiment: \"Why quibble about the story?\"[9] | The film earned $4,748,000 in the US and Canada box office and $1,976,000 elsewhere, but because of its high cost the profit was only $732,000.[4][10]","m_production":"The working title for the film was \"As the Clouds Roll By\".[2] Gene Kelly was originally intended to play Kern, with Gloria deHaven, Jacqueline White, Imogene Carpenter, a stage actress, and Jeanette MacDonald in major parts. None appeared in the film.[2] | The first 15 minutes of the film consist of a condensed adaptation of Act I of Show Boat, with the order of some of the songs shifted - \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" is sung after \"Life upon the Wicked Stage\", and \"Ol' Man River\" was used as an Act I Finale, dissimilar to the show.[citation needed] \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" as sung by Lena Horne was filmed, like many of her other musical numbers in MGM films, so that it could be easily eliminated by sensitive Southern distributors.[citation needed] | When the film started production in the fall of 1945, Judy Garland was signed as Broadway singer-dancer Marilyn Miller, having just returned to California after a long New York honeymoon with her new husband, director Vincente Minnelli.[1] Soon after, Kern returned to New York towards the end of October and died in November 1945. | During the six months that it took to shoot the film, producer Arthur Freed had to come up with one director after another. Lemuel Ayers, a set designer, was originally scheduled to make his directorial debut on the film, but was replaced by Busby Berkeley late in August 1945. Meanwhile, Minnelli – who, it was rumored at the time, would be taking over the direction of the film – was shooting Garland's sequences even before the beginning of principal photography, as Garland was pregnant and expected to give birth in March 1946; her shooting was completed on November 8, 1945. By the time full shooting began in the middle of December, Berkeley had been replaced by Henry Koster, who was also replaced after a short period by Richard Whorf. Whorf ended up receiving the onscreen directorial credit.[1][2] There was a break in production from some time in January 1946 to the middle of March of that year.[2] | The film includes two versions of \"Ol' Man River\" - the first sung by Caleb Peterson and an African-American chorus as part of the \"Show Boat\" medley, and the second, a \"crooner version\" by Frank Sinatra, featured as the grand finale. | Barbette consulted on the creation of the film's circus sequence.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Richard Whorf Uncredited Busby Berkeley[1] Henry Koster[1] Vincente Minelli (Judy Garland seqs.)[2] George Sidney (\"Ol' Man River\"/Finale)[2] | Busby Berkeley[1] | Henry Koster[1] | Vincente Minelli (Judy Garland seqs.)[2] | George Sidney (\"Ol' Man River\"/Finale)[2]","m_produced_by":"Arthur Freed","m_screenplay_by":"Myles Connolly Jean Holloway George Wells Uncredited:[2] Fred Finklehoffe John Lee Mahin Lemuel Ayers Hans Willheim","m_story_by":"Guy Bolton","m_starring":"June Allyson | Lucille Bremer | Judy Garland | Kathryn Grayson | Van Heflin | Lena Horne | Van Johnson | Angela Lansbury | Tony Martin | Virginia O'Brien | Dinah Shore | Frank Sinatra | Robert Walker","m_music_by":"Music: Jerome Kern Lyrics:[3] Leonard Joy Otto Harbach Ira Gershwin P.
