{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Care-a-lot, the Care Bears are visited by the White Rabbit, the uncle of Swift Heart Rabbit. The White Rabbit gives the Care Bears the task of finding the missing Princess of Heart, who is to be crowned queen in Wonderland, otherwise the villainous Wizard of Wonderland will gain the throne. Tenderheart, Grumpy, Good Luck, Brave Heart, Lotsa Heart, Swift Heart and the White Rabbit search all over the world for the Princess, but to no avail. Grumpy is pointed to a girl who resembles the Princess, Alice. The Care Bears decide that Alice could act as the Princess until the real one is found. The group is separated by the power of the Wizard, forcing Grumpy, Swift Heart and the White Rabbit to use a rabbit hole to reach Wonderland. | In Wonderland, Tenderheart's group gain directions to Heart Palace from Officer Caterpillar. The Wizard sends his minions Dim and Dum to capture Alice using large battle robots, but the Care Bears defeat them with a Care Bear Stare. Grumpy's group reunite with the others, as the Cheshire Cat appears, portrayed as a rap artist. The Cheshire Cat splits the group of two, directing Tenderheart, Lotsa Heart, Alice and the White Rabbit to Heart Palace, and Brave Heart, Grumpy, Good Luck and Swift Heart to look for the Mad Hatter, who knows where the Princess is. The Wizard captures Alice briefly and explains to her that when he rules he will make Wonderland less insane and more controlled. Alice flees and runs into the Queen of Hearts' throne room, where the Queen accepts Alice as her daughter whilst knowing she is not. Brave Heart's group locate the Mad Hatter who takes them to the lair of the Jabberwocky, where the Princess is. Grumpy rescues the princess, but the Jabberwocky gets a thorn in his foot which is removed by the Care Bears. In gratitude, the Jabberwocky (or \"Stan\" as he prefers to be called) decides to help them back to Heart Palace. | As the Princess' coronation day arrives, the Wizard decides to expose Alice's identity to the court via the Princess Test, to prove that she is not the princess. Alice climbs a mountain to retrieve some water from a spring, aided secretly by Tenderheart and Lotsa Heart; however, Alice gives the water to an injured unicorn. Angered by this, the Wizard demands that Alice make the flowers in the palace garden bloom magically. The princess secretly steps in and makes the flowers bloom. The Wizard, who had not been anticipating the Princess' return, suddenly exclaims he had her kidnapped, exposing his crime. The Care Bears, Alice, and the Wonderland characters confront the Wizard but the appearance of the Jabberwocky drives the villain insane, and he is arrested. The princess is crowned the new queen, and she helps Alice and the Care Bears return home. At Care-A-Lot, Grumpy raps with the Cheshire Cat who joins the Care Bears for dinner as the film ends.","m_cast":"The cast of the film:[6]","m_reception":"\"It's always been hard to care for these bears. These adventures do not change them for the better.\" | Like the first Care Bears Movie,[59]Adventure in Wonderland received mixed reviews from critics. Henry Herx in The Family Guide to Movies and Videos deemed it a \"vastly superior sequel\" to the \"failed original\": \"[It is] a lively, colourful, complexly designed and orchestrated travelolgue through Wonderland ... Director Raymond Jafelice holds even adult interest with his fast cuts and engaging fantasy characters.\"[60] while the Bantam Books guide, Movies on TV and Video Cassette gave it two and a half stars out of four and called it \"Enjoyable [...] for the tyke set.\"[61] The 1988–1989 edition of the Film Review called it \"the best of the trio\", adding that it \"may well please the youngsters\" with its \"non-stop entertainment\";[62] this view was also shared by Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch.[63] John Teerds of Brisbane, Australia's Sunday Mail wrote of the film positively,[64] while another Australian critic, Rob Lowing of Sydney's The Sun-Herald, gave it two and a half stars out of four and noted that there was \"Nothing original here, although that also means nothing to shock\".[52] Similarly, the Christian Science Monitor wrote that \"The animated action holds few surprises for grown-ups, but the cute characters and fetching designs should enthrall young children.\"[65] | In her New York Times review, Caryn James said, \"[The] movie is paced so it won't strain the attention span of a 6-month-old, but there is nothing to spark a child's imagination.\"[66] As noted Hal Hinson of The Washington Post, \"Watching [this movie] is like being pelted mercilessly for 75 minutes with Lucky Charms. It's nonfatal (unless you have a sugar problem, in which case you're likely to lapse into a coma), but it's not exactly my idea of fun either.\"[67] Rick Groen of Toronto's The Globe and Mail expressed disappointment over the way the villain was handled.[68] | Comparing this installment to its predecessors, Newsday's Joseph Gemlis declared that Wonderland \"aspires to be more than a merchandising gimmick. It has a story to tell\". However, he criticised the plot and treatment of the fictional land's denizens.[69] Film critic Leonard Maltin called it a \"typically bland kiddie outing\", awarding it two stars out of four.[70] The staff of Halliwell's Film Guide called it \"Undemanding and uninteresting whimsy for the under-sixes\",[5] while London's Time Out referred to it as \"Hemlock to Lewis Carroll fans.\"[71] In a 1988 issue, the Video Librarian labelled it a \"dud\".[72] | Adventure in Wonderland was nominated for Best Music Score (by Patricia Cullen) and Best Original Song (\"Rise and Shine\" by Maribeth Soloman) at the 1987 Genie Awards in Canada.[73] At the Young Artist Awards, it was also nominated for Best Motion Picture in the Animated category.[74]","m_production":"A third feature film based on American Greetings' Care Bears characters was under development at Toronto's Nelvana studio as early as June 1986, a few months after the release of the second instalment, The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation.[7] Nelvana had also begun production of a Care Bears television series set to air on the ABC network in the U.S., and Global in Canada.[7] Whereas the other two were co-financed with U.S. companies, Nelvana raised its own money (US$5 million)[1] for the new instalment,[4] with assistance from Middlefield Entertainment Group.[6] Production of Adventure in Wonderland, Nelvana's fourth animated feature,[8] took place at the Toronto company's facilities;[9] overseas work was handled by Taiwan's Wang Film Productions.[10] Raymond Jafelice, the director, was previously involved in the original Care Bears Movie as a storyboard artist.[11][nb 3] Nelvana's founders—Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith—were once again producers.[6] Jack Chojnacki, the co-president of American Greetings' licensing division Those Characters from Cleveland,[12] served as a creative consultant on this instalment;[6] for the previous ones, he was an executive producer.[11][13] In December 1986, Toronto actor Colin Fox recorded his lines for the film at the Nelvana studios.[14]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Raymond Jafelice","m_produced_by":"Michael Hirsh Patrick Loubert Clive A.

It was released in the United States and Canada on August 7, 1987, by Cineplex Odeon Films, and is based on Lewis Carroll's Alice stories. The fourth feature film made at Toronto's Nelvana studio, it was directed by staff member Raymond Jafelice and produced by the firm's founders (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith). It starred the voices of Keith Knight, Bob Dermer, Jim Henshaw, Tracey Moore and Elizabeth Hanna. | In the third film to feature the title characters, the Care Bears must rescue the Princess of Wonderland from the Evil Wizard and his assistants, Dim and Dumb. After the White Rabbit shows them her photo, the Bears and Cousins search around the Earth for her before enlisting a most unlikely replacement—an ordinary girl named Alice—to save her true look-alike. Venturing into Wonderland, the group encounters a host of strange characters, among them a rapping Cheshire Cat and the Jabberwocky. | Adventure in Wonderland was produced and self-financed by Nelvana, after a consortium of U.S. companies helped them with the first two films. Animation was handled by the Toronto studio and Taiwan's Wang Film Productions. The film featured a music score by Patricia Cullen, along with songs by pop musicians John Sebastian and Natalie Cole. Upon its North American release, the film opened weakly to mixed reviews, and ended up with a US$2.6 million gross; worldwide, it barely made back its US$5 million cost. In the years since it opened, Wonderland has received many VHS and DVD releases in various countries; a North American Region 1 premiere has yet to occur. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Hayden, Gene (August 7, 1989). \"Babar's triumphs\".
