{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":"The following is a list of cast members who voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the extended version of The Lord of the Rings film series.","m_reception":"Unadjusted for inflation, The Lord of the Rings film series is the highest grossing film trilogy worldwide of all time, higher even than other film franchises such as the original Star Wars trilogy and The Godfather trilogy. The film series grossed a total of $2.92 billion and also tied a record with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the total number of Academy Awards won for a single film, with The Return of the King receiving eleven Oscars.[55] | The majority of critics have also praised the series, with Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times writing that \"the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal\".[56] Some were critical of the films' pacing and length: \"It's a collection of spectacular set pieces without any sense of momentum driving them into one another\" according to Philadelphia Weekly.[57] | On Rotten Tomatoes, the films received approval ratings of 91%, 96%, and 95% respectively.[58][59][60] Metacritic, based on its ratings for each film (92, 88, and 94 respectively),[61][62][63] lists the series as one of the two most critically acclaimed trilogies of all time.[citation needed] Every film is placed in the top 100 of the 'Metacritic Best-Reviewed Movies' list.[citation needed] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the films an average grade of A-, A, and A+ respectively on an A+ to F scale.[64] | The series appears in the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association's Top 10 Films, Time magazine's All-Time 100 Movies, and James Berardinelli's Top 100.[65] In 2007, USA Today named the series as the most important films of the past 25 years.[66] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Bringing a cherished book to the big screen? No sweat. Peter Jackson's trilogy — or, as we like to call it, our preciousssss — exerted its irresistible pull, on advanced Elvish speakers and neophytes alike.\"[67] Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000–2009), ranking it at No. 4.[68] In another Time magazine list, the series ranks second in \"Best Movies of the Decade\".[69] Empire magazine voted the films at #1 on the '32 Greatest Film Trilogies'.[70] In addition, six characters and their respective actors made the list of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Characters', also compiled by Empire, with Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn ranking No. 15, Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf ranking No. 30, Ian Holm's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins (shared with Martin Freeman for his portrayal of the same character in The Hobbit films) ranking No. 61, Andy Serkis' portrayal of Gollum ranking No. 66, Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee ranking No. 77, and Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Legolas ranking No. 94.[71] | The three films together were nominated for a total of 30 Academy Awards, of which they won 17, a record for any movie trilogy (the three nominations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug along with the single nomination for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies brings the series' total to 37 nominations). The Fellowship of the Ring earned thirteen nominations, the most of any film at the 74th Academy Awards, winning four. The Return of the King won in every category in which it was nominated, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 Academy Awards wins ties the record held by Ben-Hur and Titanic (though both of those films had additional nominations that they ultimately lost). The Return of the King became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture (after The Godfather Part II) and the first and only fantasy film to receive this honor, though this has been widely perceived as an award by proxy for the entire series (the first two films were also nominated for Best Picture).[72] No actors in any of the three films won Oscars, and Ian McKellen was the only actor in the trilogy to receive a nomination, for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring.[72] | The Fellowship of the Ring – Nominations: 13, Wins: 4 | The Two Towers — Nominations: 6, Wins: 2 | The Return of the King — Nominations: 11, Wins: 11 | As well as Academy Awards, each film in the series won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the MTV Movie Award for Best Movie, and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. The first and third films also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. The soundtrack for The Two Towers did not receive a nomination because of a rule prohibiting a soundtrack including music from a previous soundtrack to be eligible for nomination. This rule was changed in time for The Return of the King to receive the Oscar for Best Music Score. The New York Film Critics Circle awarded The Return of the King its Best Picture Award at the 2003 Awards Ceremony, hosted by Andrew Johnston, chair of the organization at that time, who called it \"a masterful piece of filmmaking.\"[73] | The film series provoked both positive and negative reaction from fans and scholars of the novels, and was sometimes seen as changing parts Tolkien felt thematically necessary in terms of characters, themes, events and subtlety. Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released fan edits of the films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition,[74][75] which removed many of the changes to bring them closer to the original. | Various changes to characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were seen by some to alter the tone and themes found in the books. Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.[76][77][78][79] Wayne G. Hammond, a Tolkien scholar,[80][81] said of the first two films that he found them to be \"travesties as adaptations... faithful only on a basic level of plot\" and that many characters had not been depicted faithfully to their appearance in the novel.[82][83] Other critics have argued that Tolkien's characters were weakened and misinterpreted by their portrayal in the films.[84][85][86] | Changes to events (such as the Elves participating at the Battle of Helm's Deep,[87] Faramir taking the hobbits to Osgiliath,[88] and the deletion of the chapter \"The Scouring of the Shire\") are also seen as changing Tolkien's themes.[88] | Janet Brennan Croft criticized the films using Tolkien's own terms \"anticipation\" and \"flattening\", which she used in critiquing a proposed film script. She contrasts Tolkien's subtlety with Jackson's tendency to show \"too much too soon\".[89] | Supporters of the series assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book and that most of the changes were necessary.[22] Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person,[90] and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, \"Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie.\"[91][92] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible.[93] This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of \"faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone.\"[94] Douglas Kellner argues that the conservative community spirit of Tolkien's Shire is reflected in Jackson's films as well as the division of the Fellowship into \"squabbling races\".[95] | The release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture.[96] It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with Christopher Tolkien and his son Simon Tolkien feuding over whether or not it was a good idea to adapt.[97] Christopher has since denied these claims, saying, \"My own position is that The Lord of the Rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, even to the extent of thinking ill of those with whom I may differ, are wholly without foundation.\" He added that he had never \"expressed any such feeling\".[98] In 2012, however, he described the films as having \"eviscerated\" the book, and criticized the resulting \"commercialisation\" of his father's work.[99][100] | As a result of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become a major player in the film business (sometimes called a mogul) in the mold of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series. Jackson has been called a \"favourite son\" of New Zealand.[101] In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score. Along with the Harry Potter films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. Tourism for New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series,[102] with the country's tourism industry waking up to an audience's familiarity.[103] | In December 2002, The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: The Exhibition opened at the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand. As of 2007, the exhibition has traveled to seven other cities around the world. A musical adaptation of the book was launched in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2006, but it closed after mostly poor reviews. A shortened version opened in London, United Kingdom, in the summer of 2007. The success of the films has also spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise. | They eviscerated the book by making it an action movie for young people aged 15 to 25, and it seems that The Hobbit will be the same kind of film. [...] Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed by the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has gone too far for me. Such commercialisation has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of this creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: turning my head away. | The legacy of The Lord of the Rings is also that of court cases over profits from the trilogy. Sixteen cast members (Noel Appleby (de), Jed Brophy, Mark Ferguson, Ray Henwood, Bruce Hopkins, William Johnson, Nathaniel Lees, Sarah McLeod, Ian Mune, Paul Norell, Craig Parker, Robert Pollock, Martyn Sanderson, Peter Tait and Stephan Ure (de)) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance. The case was resolved out of court in 2008. The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007.[104] Saul Zaentz also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties. The next year, Jackson himself sued the studio over profits from the first film, slowing development of the prequels until late 2007.[105] The Tolkien Trust filed a lawsuit in February 2008, for violating Tolkien's original deal over the rights that they would earn 7.5% of the gross from any films based on his works.[106] The Trust sought compensation of $150 million.[107] A judge denied them this option, but allowed them to win compensation from the act of the studio ignoring the contract itself.[108] On 8 September 2009, a settlement of this dispute between the Trust and New Line was announced, clearing a potential obstacle to the making of a new film based on The Hobbit.[109]","m_production":"Jackson began storyboarding the series with Christian Rivers in August 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.[21] Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997,[14] famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations.[22] Production designer Grant Major was charged with the task of converting Lee and Howe's designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, while Dan Hennah worked as art director, scouting locations and organising the building of sets. | Jackson's vision of Middle-earth was described as being \"Ray Harryhausen meets David Lean\" by Randy Cook.[23] Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted to make the world rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand Army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow.[24] Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the fell beast to help it fly.[25] In total, 48,000 pieces of armour, 500 bows, and 10,000 arrows were created by Weta Workshop.[26] They also created many prosthetics, such as 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet for the lead actors,[14] as well as many ears, noses, and heads for the cast, and around 19,000 costumes were woven and aged.[14] Every prop was specially designed by the Art Department, taking the different scales into account.[14]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Lord of the Rings  by J.

They are based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). They were distributed by New Line Cinema. | Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million),[3] the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native country.[4] Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material. | Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship becomes divided and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite and rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring. | The series was a major financial success, with the films collectively being among the highest-grossing film series of all time. The films were critically acclaimed and heavily awarded, winning 17 out of 30 total Academy Award nominations. The final film in the series, The Return of the King, won all of its 11 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects.[5][6][7] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition commentary - 2003 New Line Cinema | ^ \"'Hobbit' Trilogy Has Cost $561 Million So Far\".
