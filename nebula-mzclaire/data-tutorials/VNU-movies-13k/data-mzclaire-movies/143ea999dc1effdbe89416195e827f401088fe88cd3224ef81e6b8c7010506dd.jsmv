{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Vacationing in a small seaside village, Aochi, a professor of German, runs into Nakasago, a former colleague turned nomad. Nakasago is being pursued by an angry mob for allegedly seducing and killing a fisherman's wife. Police intervene and Aochi vouches for his friend, preventing his arrest. The two catch up over dinner where they are entertained by and become smitten with the mourning geisha Koine. Six months later, Aochi visits his friend and is shocked to find he's settled down and is having a child with Sono, a woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to Koine. Nakasago plays him a recording of Zigeunerweisen and they discuss inaudible mumbling on the record. Nakasago suddenly takes to the road again with Koine, leaving Sono to birth their child alone. Both men enter affairs with the other's wife. Sono later dies of the flu and is replaced by Koine as a surrogate mother. Nakasago takes to the road yet again. Aochi learns of Nakasago's death in a landslide. Koine visits Aochi and requests the return of the Zigeunerweisen record but he is sure he never borrowed it.","m_cast":"Yoshio Harada as Nakasago | Naoko Otani as Koine/Sono | Toshiya Fujita as Aochi | Michiyo Okusu as Shuko, Aochi's wife | Kisako Makishi as Taeko | Kirin Kiki as Kimi | Akaji Maro as Blind Man | Sumie Sasaki as Maid in a hotel | Isao Tamagawa as Doctor Amaki | Hatsuo Yamaya as a Policeman","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Director Seijun Suzuki was ostensibly terminated from his contract with Nikkatsu Studios in 1968 for making \"movies that make no sense and no money\" and subsequently blacklisted.[1] In the proceeding years he met frequently with his crew at his home in developing ideas for new projects. This resulted in Zigeunerweisen and Kagero-za—the first two films in what would become Suzuki's Taishō Roman Trilogy. Suzuki felt that action films were falling out of favour and wanted to create a new type of film. Writer Yōzō Tanaka lived close by and visited Suzuki regularly where they infrequently discussed the film during games of Go. The story was based on Hyakken Uchida's novel, Disk of Sarasate. It was felt to be too short and was expanded from their conversations. For example, when Tanaka's uncle died during that time, he noticed that his cremated bones were pink. This was incorporated into the screenplay.[2] | Suzuki's de facto blacklisting ended with the release of his critically and commercially unsuccessful 1977 film A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness. The money to finance Zigeunerweisen only became available in 1979 when Suzuki met then–theatre producer Genjiro Arato.[3] Thus it became their first fully independently produced film.[4] It was shot on location in Japan.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Seijun Suzuki","m_produced_by":"Genjiro Arato","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Yoshio Harada Naoko Otani Toshiya Fujita","m_music_by":"Kaname Kawachi","m_cinematography":"Kazue Nagatsuka","m_edited_by":"Nobutake Kamiya","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Cinema Placet","m_release_dates":"April 1, 1980 (1980-04-01) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"145 minutes","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"Japanese | Zigeunerweisen (Japanese: ツィゴイネルワイゼン, Hepburn: Tsigoineruwaizen?, from the German \"Gypsy Airs\") is a 1980 independent Japanese film directed by Seijun Suzuki and based on Hyakken Uchida's novel, Disk of Sarasate. It takes its title from a gramophone recording of Pablo de Sarasate's violin composition, Zigeunerweisen, which features prominently in the story. The film makes the first part of Suzuki's Taishō Roman Trilogy, followed by Kagero-za (1981) and Yumeji (1991), surrealistic psychological dramas and ghost stories linked by style, themes and the Taishō period (1912-1926) setting. All three were produced by Genjiro Arato. | When exhibitors declined to screen the film, Arato screened it himself in an inflatable, mobile tent to great success. It won Honourable Mention at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival, was nominated for nine Japanese Academy Awards and won four, including best director and best film, and was voted the number one Japanese film of the 1980s by Japanese critics. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Suzuki, Seijun (interviewee) (1999).
