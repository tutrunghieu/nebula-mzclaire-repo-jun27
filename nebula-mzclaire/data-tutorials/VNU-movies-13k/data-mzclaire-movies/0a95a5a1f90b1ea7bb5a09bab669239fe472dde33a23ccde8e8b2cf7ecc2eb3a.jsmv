Having been only a child during the move, Ah-ha quickly acclimatizes himself to the new country, often putting him at odds with his more traditional family; he joins a street gang and has to choose between that life and taking the college entrance exam.","m_cast":"Chia-bao Chang | Neng Chang | Chih-chen Chen | Han-wen Chen | Shu-fang Chen | Bao-te Chiang | Tung-hung Chou | Ai Hsiao | Hsiang-ping Hu | Tung-lai Kao | Chung-wen Lin | Kuo-bao Liu | Cheng-ye Lo | Shun-lin Lo | Tse-chung Lo","m_reception":"Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval for The Time to Live and the Time to Die, based on five reviews with an average rating of 8.2/10. Janet Maslin of the New York Times praised its cinematography and wrote that \"much of the film is about suffering and loss, detailing the painful circumstances in which family members, one by one, grow ill and die. The simplicity and tact with which these illnesses are chronicled help to give an otherwise largely uneventful film some emotional impact…It's an unpretentious and largely unremarkable film that occasionally reaches unexpected depths of feeling.\"[1] Variety called it a \"beautifully controlled and highly nostalgic picture of childhood.\"[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Hou Hsiao-Hsien","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"You An-shun Tien Feng Xin Shufen","m_music_by":"Wu Chu-chu","m_cinematography":"Mark Lee Ping-Bin","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Central Motion Pictures Corporation","m_release_dates":"1985","m_running_time":"138 minutes","m_country":"Taiwan","m_language":"Mandarin/Hakka Chinese/Taiwanese | The Time to Live and the Time to Die (also known as A Time to Live, A Time to Die; Chinese: 童年往事; pinyin: Tóngnián wǎngshì, lit. \"Incidents from a Childhood Past\") is a 1985 film directed by Hou Hsiao-Hsien.
