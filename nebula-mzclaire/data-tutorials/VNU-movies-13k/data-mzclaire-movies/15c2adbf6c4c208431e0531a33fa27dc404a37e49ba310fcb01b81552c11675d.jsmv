{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bob McGraw, Max, Gonzer, and Irwin, students at Lepetomane University (known derisively by some as \"Lobotomy U\"), are volunteered to compete in a collegiate raft race. They are \"recruited\" by Dean Burch who uses records of McGraw's checkered past as a means of blackmail to get them to compete. \"You're not AT the bottom of the list. You ARE the bottom of the list!\", says Burch. He even offers them degrees in the major of their choice as additional incentive. They're up against Ivy University, prep schoolers who, with the help of an Ivy alumnus named Dr. Roland Tozer, plan to cheat their way to the Winner's Circle. | Their adversaries also include the Washington Military Institute, disqualified for their attempts to sabotage the other schools' rafts. Captain Braverman, the leader of the Military men, has it in for McGraw because he personally curtailed the attempts to sabotage the other rafts. Also entered is a team of beautiful co-eds, one of whom ends up falling for Bob. The dangerous rapids as well as Ivy's cheating end up disabling many of the other teams' rafts. It is all down river adventure for the Lepetomane gang.","m_cast":"Tim Matheson ... Bob McGraw | Dan Monahan ... Max | Sandy Helberg ... Irwin | Stephen Furst ... Gonzer | Jennifer Runyon ...

They don't push themselves upon us, and that allows us to identify with them in a relaxed way. The result is a very tight script with breathing room. That's most unusual for a teen comedy, and that's why Up the Creek is one of the best.\"[5]","m_production":"This film was filmed near Bend, Oregon. | Writer Jim Kouf later said Robert Butler \"was not a great comedy director, he missed a lot of jokes.‚Äù[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"story by Jim Kouf Jeff Sherman Douglas Grossman","m_directed_by":"Robert Butler","m_produced_by":"Michael L.
