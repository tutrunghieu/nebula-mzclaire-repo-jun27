{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1988, the US submarine USS Montana has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object and sinks near the Cayman Trough. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a hurricane moving over the area, the US government opts to send a SEAL team to Deep Core, a privately owned experimental underwater drilling platform near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on coming along with the SEAL team, despite her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman being the current foreman. | During initial investigation of the Montana, a power outage in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub. At the same time, one of Deep Core's crew, \"Jammer\", damages his breathing apparatus in an apparent panic, and falls into a coma. This prompts the admiral in charge of the operation to send Lt. Coffey, the SEAL team leader, to take one of the mini-subs and recover a Trident missile warhead from the Montana, just as the storm hits above. The Benthic Explorer, which Deep Core is tethered to, is rocked by the storm, and the cable crane is torn from the ship. The crane falls into the trench and, without the mini-sub to disconnect the cable, Deep Core is dragged towards the trench, stopping just short of it. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems. Coffey shows little remorse when they return to the damaged base. | Lindsey is sent in dive gear to retrieve some oxygen bottles from a damaged portion of the rig to give the crew enough time to wait out the storm. While working, she's accosted by a small, maneuverable pink/purple device, followed by a much larger one. Before she can take a picture as proof, the large craft zooms downward into the trench, leaving her to take fuzzy, smeared pictures of the smaller one following it. She coins the term \"non-terrestrial intelligence\", or \"NTI\". As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed a living column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew becomes convinced that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsay give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch to the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts over the edge of the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsay opts to enter deep hibernation when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her. Bud and Lindsay reaffirm their lost love. | One SEAL, unaware of Coffey's plan at the time, helps to locate the warhead, stopped on a ledge several thousand feet down the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsay's voice keeping him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in disarming it, but his only light source is yellow, making two high-contrast striped wires appear identical, forcing him to make a 50-50 choice on which wire to cut. With nearly no oxygen left in the system, Bud types out that he knew this was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsay he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and takes his hand. He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife and the two look at each other with understanding. | On Deep Core the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warning them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with Deep Core and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of Deep Core leave the platform, surprised they aren't suffering from decompression sickness, when they see Bud walking out of the alien ship. Lindsay races to hug Bud. | In the extended version, the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war; the sinking of the Montana fueling the aggression. There is more conflict between Bud and Lindsay in regards to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive tidal waves that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. They then show Bud his message to Lindsay, and let the tidal waves disperse without damage, as a warning to humanity.","m_cast":"Ed Harris as Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman, Deep Core's foreman and Lindsey's estranged husband. | Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Dr. Lindsey Brigman, designer of the rig and Bud's estranged wife. | Michael Biehn as US Navy SEAL Lieutenant Hiram Coffey, the commander of the Navy SEAL team. | J.C.

It went on to make $54,461,047 in North America and $35,539,051 throughout the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $90,000,098, above its estimated $70 million production budget.[25] | On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, The Abyss has \"Certified Fresh\" score of 89% based on 44 reviews with an average rating of 7.2 out of 10. The critical consensus states: \"The utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that The Abyss is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters.\"[26] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 14 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[27] | Newsweek magazine's David Ansen, summarizing the theatrical release, wrote, \"The payoff to The Abyss is pretty damn silly â€” a portentous deus ex machina that leaves too many questions unanswered and evokes too many other films.\"[28] In her review for The New York Times, Caryn James claimed that the film had \"at least four endings,\" and \"by the time the last ending of this two-and-a-quarter-hour film comes along, the effect is like getting off a demon roller coaster that has kept racing several laps after you were ready to get off.\"[29] Chris Dafoe, in his review for The Globe and Mail, wrote, \"At its best, The Abyss offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension. In the end, however, this torpedo turns out to be a dud - it swerves at the last minute, missing its target and exploding ineffectually in a flash of fantasy and fairy-tale schtick.\"[30] | While praising the film's first two hours as \"compelling\", the Toronto Star remarked, \"But when Cameron takes the adventure to the next step, deep into the heart of fantasy, it all becomes one great big deja boo. If we are to believe what Cameron finds way down there, E.T. didn't really phone home, he went surfing and fell off his board.\"[31] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"Most of this underwater blockbuster is 'good,' and at least two action set pieces are great. But the dopey wrap-up sinks the rest 20,000 leagues.\"[32] In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote that the film \"asks us to believe that the drowned return to life, that the comatose come to the rescue, that driven women become doting wives, that Neptune cares about landlubbers. I'd sooner believe that Moby Dick could swim up the drainpipe.\"[33] Halliwell's Film Guide claimed the film was \"despite some clever special effects, a tedious, overlong fantasy that is more excited by machinery than people.\"[34] Conversely, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers enthused, \"[The Abyss is] the greatest underwater adventure ever filmed, the most consistently enthralling of the summer blockbusters...one of the best pictures of the year.\"[35] | The reviews tallied therein contain reviews for both the theatrical release and the Special Edition. The release of the Special Edition in 1993 garnered much praise. Each giving it thumbs up, Siskel remarked, \"The Abyss has been improved,\" and Ebert added, \"It makes the film seem more well rounded.\"[36] In the book Reel Views 2, James Berardinelli comments, \"James Cameron's The Abyss may be the most extreme example of an available movie that demonstrates how the vision of a director, once fully realized on screen, can transform a good motion picture into a great one.\"[37] | The Abyss won the 1990 Oscar for Best Visual Effects (John Bruno, Dennis Muren, Hoyt Yeatman, and Dennis Skotak). It was also nominated for: | Best Art Direction/Set Decoration (Leslie Dilley, Anne Kuljian) | Best Cinematography (Mikael Salomon) | Best Sound (Don J. Bassman, Kevin F. Cleary, Richard Overton, and Lee Orloff)[38] | The studio unsuccessfully lobbied hard to get Michael Biehn nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[citation needed] | Many other film organizations, such as the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films and the American Society of Cinematographers, also nominated The Abyss. The film ended up winning a total of three other awards from these organizations.","m_production":"H. G. Wells was the first to introduce the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story In the Abyss.[5] The idea for The Abyss came to James Cameron when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture about deep sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who was the first human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Dr. Johannes A. Kylstra.[6][7][8] He subsequently wrote a short story[9] that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details evolved over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.[10] While making Aliens, Cameron saw a National Geographic film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story.[8] He and producer Gale Anne Hurd decided that The Abyss would be their next film.[9] Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987.[9] Cameron and Hurd were married before The Abyss, separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.[11] | The cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the Cayman Islands.[12] This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.[13] | Cameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the Bahamas where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.[13] He considered shooting the film in Malta, which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.[8] Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the Gaffney Studios, situated outside Gaffney, South Carolina, which had been abandoned by Duke Power officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant.[12] | Two specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held 7.5Â million US gallons (28,000Â m3) of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held 2.5Â million US gallons (9,500Â m3) of water.[13] As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.[14] The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.[15] | Can-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in saturation diving systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.[10] | Filming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world â€” a mine in Bonne Terre, Missouri, which was the background for several underwater shots.[16][17] | The main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.[14] Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and 150,000 US gallons (570Â m3) of water a minute rushed out.[9] The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.[9] | Cameron's choice of cinematographer on the movie was Mikael Salomon â€“ a US-based Danish national who would go on to work on other blockbusters such as Backdraft and Arachnophobia before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series Band of Brothers. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.[15] Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin.[15] Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.[15] | The breathing fluid used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.[18] Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed, although the scene was censored in Britain for perceived cruelty to animals.[19] | Ed Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.[11] Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.[11] | The cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ever want to go through this again\".[10] For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.[11] Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting The Abyss has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\"[12] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.[14] Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.[20] In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.[20] | As production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\".[11] At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.[20] While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\" For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.[11] He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out.\"[7] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, \"For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air.\"[11] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988.[20] Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film.[11] But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying \"I'm never talking about it and never will.\" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, \"The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them.\"[21] | To create the alien water tentacle, Cameron initially considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic.[14] The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM.[10] ILM designed a program to produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod.[14] For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage.[14] The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed for more than a month by production and special effects problems.[11] The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.[22] | Studio executives were nervous about the film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also a question of the size of the film's budget. One executive claimed $47 million while The Wall Street Journal reported a figure of $60 million.[23] Box office revenue tracker site The Numbers lists the production budget at $70 million.[3] When promoting the film on Late Night with David Letterman, Cameron himself said the production budget was $43 million.[24] None of these figures include marketing or distribution costs.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Cameron","m_produced_by":"Gale Anne Hurd Special edition: Van Ling","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ed Harris | Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio | Michael Biehn","m_music_by":"Alan Silvestri","m_cinematography":"Mikael Salomon","m_edited_by":"Conrad Buff IV Joel Goodman Howard E.
