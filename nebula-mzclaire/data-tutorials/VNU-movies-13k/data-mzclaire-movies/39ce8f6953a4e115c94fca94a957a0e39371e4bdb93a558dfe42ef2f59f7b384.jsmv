{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins in a maternity ward of a hospital, where the mother of Solmaz Gholami is upset to learn that her daughter has just given birth to a girl, even though the ultrasound indicated that the baby would be a boy. Worrying that her in-laws will force their son to divorce her daughter, she tells another daughter to call her uncles. | At the phone booth, she passes by three young women, including Arezou and Nargess, who have just escaped prison. The three of them are trying to come up with money so that they can go to Nargess's home village. The third prisoner is immediately arrested, as she tries to pawn a gold chain, leaving just the two women. Nargess spots what she thinks is a landscape-painting of her hometown at a nearby shop and describes to Arezou the paradise awaiting them at the end of their bus journey. Arezou in the meantime finds enough money from an acquaintance to get Nargess a bus ticket, deciding not to go herself. The two of them separate. | At the bus station, however, Nargess can't get on the bus, because it is being searched by the police, and she is afraid that she will be arrested again. Instead she tries to find another prisoner, Pari, who also snuck out of the prison that day. Pari's father will not let her in the house, however, and just as Nargess leaves, Pari's two brothers arrive, and angrily force their way into the house, in order to \"talk\" to their sister. Pari manages to escape, and eventually makes her way to a hospital where she finds Elham, another former prisoner who has hidden her past and is now a nurse, married to a doctor. | From her conversation with Elham, we learn that Pari is pregnant, but the father of her baby has been executed, and she has no one to approve her having an abortion. Elham, concerned about arousing suspicions about her own past, is reluctant to do anything to help her, so Pari is left to wander the streets at night. Without ID, she cannot get into a hotel. At a street corner, she finds a mother trying to abandon her little girl, hoping that she will find a better life with a family. She continues wandering the street. | The mother is caught by an undercover police officer who thinks she is a prostitute, but she later manages to escape. Then, another woman who has been picked up as a prostitute is taken to prison. She is placed in a cell with other women we met so far in the film, and the phone rings outside the metal door. A guard answers and comes to the window, calling for Solmaz Gholami, the woman with a baby girl in the first scene, bringing the story to a full circle.","m_cast":"Nargess Mamizadeh as Nargess | Maryiam Parvin Almani as Arezou | Mojgan Faramarzi as Prostitute | Elham Saboktakin as Nurse | Monir Arab as Ticket seller | Solmaz Panahi as Solmaz | Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee as Pari | Fatemeh Naghavi as Mother | Abbas Alizadeh as Pari's father | Negar Ghadyani | Liam Kimber as Sahij | Ataollah Moghadas as Haji | Khadijeh Moradi | Maryam Shayegan as Parveneh | Maedeh Tahmasebi as Maedeh","m_reception":"The Circle received critical acclaim.
