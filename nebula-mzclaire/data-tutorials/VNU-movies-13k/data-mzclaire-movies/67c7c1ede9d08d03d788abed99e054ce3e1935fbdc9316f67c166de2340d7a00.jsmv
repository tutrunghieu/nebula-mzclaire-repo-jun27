He lives in Chorcán, a small hamlet in the Jujuy Province. | One day Mr. Lehrer (Juan José Camero) arrives in Chorcán to take the job as the new school teacher. Verónico comes to idolize his new teacher, who is also known as el maestro as a sign of respect and affection. | At one point in the film el maestro takes Verónico on his first road trip to San Salvador de Jujuy, the capital of the Jujuy Province, to look for Verónico's father, who the boy has never met. While there Lehrer is interrogated harshly by government authorities and discovers Castulo Cruz is considered a subversive by the military and that he probably has become a desaparecido. | As Verónico Cruz learns about the outside world from his teacher, so too does Lehrer come to understand and appreciate the indigenous people who live in northwest rural Argentina and their history. | Lehrer, near the end of the film, is given a promotion and leaves Verónico's small village to teach at a larger school far away. | However, the warm relationship between el maestro and Verónico ends after Verónico joins the navy and Argentine troops invade the Falkland Islands. | El maestro later gets a letter from Verónico, that he is serving at the ARA Belgrano as a crewman, at the same time that he gets news that the ARA Belgrano has been sunk by a British submarine.","m_cast":"Juan José Camero as Lehrer, the teacher who befriends Verónico.

This second group of films uses metaphor and hints at wider socio-political issues.[2][3] | Miguel Pereira, in neo-realist fashion, used extras and bit players when he filmed in the Jujuy Province and Chorcán. | Filming locations include; Chorcán, Humahuaca Department; San Salvador de Jujuy; both in the Jujuy Province, Argentina. Jujuy Province is located in the northwest part of Argentina, high in the Andes.[4] | According to the New Internationalist some of the English press was critical of the film's funding. The British Film Institute and Channel Four partly funded the film and the English provincial press called their action \"treasonable.\" The Falklands War was, after all, between Great Britain and Argentina they argued.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Miguel Pereira","m_produced_by":"Julio Lencina Sasha Menocki","m_screenplay_by":"Miguel Pereira Eduardo Leiva Muller","m_story_by":"Fortunato Ramos","m_starring":"Juan José Camero Gonzalo Morales","m_music_by":"Jaime Torres","m_cinematography":"Gerry Feeny","m_edited_by":"Gerry Feeny","m_production_company":"British Film Institute Mainframe Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Cinevista Channel Four Films Yacoraite Film Limitada","m_release_dates":"August 4, 1988 (1988-08-04) (Argentina) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 minutes","m_country":"Argentina United Kingdom","m_language":"Spanish | Verónico Cruz (Spanish: Verónico Cruz: La deuda interna) is a 1988 Argentine and British drama film.
