{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"April O'Neil, a reporter for Channel 6 Eyewitness News in New York City, investigates a crime wave by a group of criminals called the Foot Clan. At a dock at night, she sees the Foot raiding cargo containers. After an unseen vigilante attacks the thieves, April notices a symbol left behind. April's supervisor Bernadette Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg) and her coworkers are oblivious to her story. Later while covering a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, April expresses gratitude to the company's CEO Eric Sacks, who was her late father's lab partner. | Frustrated by the vigilante, the Foot Clan's leader Shredder has the Foot Soldiers take hostages at a subway station in order to draw him out. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. Four mysterious figures arrive, take out the Clan, and free the hostages. April follows them to a rooftop and is confronted by four anthropomorphic mutant turtles, causing her to pass out. When she regains consciousness, they advise her not to tell anyone of them. As they leave, April hears Raphael and Leonardo's names. | April returns to her apartment and remembers \"Project Renaissance\", her father's science experiment, which involved four turtles named Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, and a mutated rat called Splinter. Unable to convince Bernadette of the Turtles' existence, April is dismissed. Her coworker Vern Fenwick drives her to Sacks' estate where she confides in him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought lost in the fire that killed her dad. | At Splinter's behest, the Turtles bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewers. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, using April's father as an example. After finding a book on Ninjitsu in a storm drain, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, in the fighting style. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks turned on her father and killed him. | Then, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, defeating Splinter and incapacitating Raphael while the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks' estate, he has the Turtles' blood drained in order to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks hopes to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group then escapes the compound in pursuit of Sacks. | On a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus while Sacks is preparing to convert the mutagen to healing factor. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles battling Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the tower's support beams collapse. As the turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, April confronts Shredder with the mutagen. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it with them, while Shredder falls to the street and is confronted by police. Believing they are about to die, the Turtles confess their secrets, while Raphael gives an impassioned speech of his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover. | Sometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date. The Turtles appear in a special modified \"Turtle Van\", and Michelangelo accidentally blows up Vern's new car with a rocket. As police respond to the explosion, the Turtles leave, but not before Mikey tries to serenade April with \"Happy Together\", much to his brothers' annoyance and April's joy.","m_cast":"Megan Fox as April O'Neil Malina Weissman as young April O'Neil | Will Arnett as Vern Fenwick | William Fichtner as Eric Sacks | Tohoru Masamune as Oroku Saki / The Shredder [8] | Whoopi Goldberg as Bernadette Thompson | Minae Noji as Karai | Abby Elliott as Taylor | Taran Killam as McNaughton | K.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"Neither entertaining enough to recommend nor remarkably awful, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles may bear the distinction of being the dullest movie ever made about talking bipedal reptiles.\"[117] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 31 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[118] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a B grade on a scale of A to F.[119] | Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"The comedy-action mash-up is as weird as if the Dark Knight took a break from belting the Joker to plug Pizza Hut and bang out a hiphop beat on his nunchucks.\"[120] Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"While this reboot is fun, it's also forgettable and occasionally infuriating.\"[121] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film zero stars, saying \"Even youngsters may wonder why any hint of charm or fun has scurried away. Those new to the franchise may withdraw their head into their neck, turtle-like.\"[122] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Rougher and slightly funnier than the 1990 original, but still harmless junk at best.\"[123] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film one and half stars out of four, saying \"Not much of an effort is made to differentiate the personalities of the turtles, who all frankly look as grotesque as a Terry Gilliam cartoon.\"[124] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times said \"Attached to this movie, the title no longer sounds zany; it looks like a series of keywords.\"[125] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said \"There is something half-hearted about the entire film, as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it, not because they should make it, but just because they could.\"[126] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+, saying \"Too-brief thrills only shine a harsher light on the film's laborious pacing and cringeworthy one-liners spilling from the maws of the ninja teens.\"[127] | Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying \"Liebesman relies on his genre-film resume to keep events moving at a brisk clip and the motion-capture process employed to facilitate live-action integration with cutting-edge VFX looks superior onscreen.\"[128] Justin Chang of Variety said the film is \"Neither a particularly good movie nor the pop-cultural travesty that some were dreading.\"[129] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying \"What the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lacks is not fidelity, but a spirit of genuine boyish fun -- the sense that anyone involved saw more than a very specific shade of green in the freshly digital scales of these 30-year-old characters.\"[130] Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"If ever there was a movie that should not have been made, this is that movie.\"[131] Drew Hunt of Chicago Reader said \"The light, comedic tone is weighed down by unimaginative pop-culture references and half-witted one-liners.\"[132] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"It's just kind of a mess, as unfocused and immature as the four mutant turtles at its core. Stuff happens, stuff blows up and this is probably a good time to mention that Michael Bay produced the film.\"[133] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a movie that takes its characters and its premise seriously, until it doesn't, and that operates at two speeds: tortoise (ponderous) and hare (head-spinning).\"[134] | Adam Graham of The Detroit News gave the film a B-, saying \"There's enough turtle power to please kids and fans of the original series.\"[135] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The kind of cliched, misfit crimefighters-versus-demented villains scenario that Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird happily parodied when they came up with the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic books way back in the 1980s.\"[136] Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying \"The repartee, as ever, is weak.

Bay, Fuller, and Form would produce alongside Walker and Mednick.[10] For the script, the studio originally hired Art Marcum and Matt Holloway to write the film for close to a million dollars. According to TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman, the John Fusco version was a little too edgy for what Paramount wanted.[11] A year later, the studio turned to writers Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec to rewrite the script.[12][13] In February 2012, Jonathan Liebesman began negotiations to direct the film, beating out Brett Ratner.[14] Later in March, it was announced that Paramount had pushed back film's release date to Christmas Day 2013.[15] In early March 2012, Bay revealed at Nickelodeon's 2012 upfront presentation that the film will be simply titled Ninja Turtles and that the turtles would be \"from an alien race\".[16][17] News of Bay's creative change was met with criticism from within the fan community.[18] | In response to the announcement, actor Robbie Rist, who voiced Michelangelo in the first three films, wrote to Bay accusing him of \"sodomizing\" the franchise. Rist later remarked that he could have been out of line since Bay makes more money than he does.[19] In response to the feedback, Bay issued a statement asking fans to calm down since a script had not been revealed, his team was working closely with the creators, and would include all the elements that made them fans to begin with.[20] Both Brian Tochi, who voiced Leonardo in the first three films, and Judith Hoag, who played April O'Neil in the first film, have voiced their support towards the creative change.[21] TMNT co-creator Peter Laird expressed his thoughts on the change asking fans to take Bay's advice and wait until more of Bay's plan is made available. Laird also stated that he felt the \"ill-conceived plan\" could be a \"genius notion,\" as it would allow fans to have the multitude of bipedal anthropomorphic turtles that they have been asking for. He would point out that while the concept of a turtle-planet backstory made for a great run-of-the-mill science fiction story, it had no real place in the Ninja Turtles universe.[22] | Franchise's co-creator Kevin Eastman stated that he had been invited behind the scenes of the film, and concluded that he was officially on board with the project and that, although he could not say much, he believes it to be \"awesome\".[23] Via Twitter, Corey Feldman, who voiced Donatello in the first and third films, voiced his support for the film saying that he loves Bay's remakes and he is eager to reprise his role.[24] In response to the backlash, Liebesman stated that he was glad to hear about the fans' response, since he and Eastman had been locked in a room working on ideas that, from his own perspective as a fan, everybody would love.[25] While he would not confirm whether or not Bay's comment did represent the film's premise, he did stress on the ooze itself and its background in the original comic, reminding that the ooze was the product of alien technology. In regards to how the Turtles would be rendered, Liebesman would not say exactly what visual direction would be taken, but he did state that he enjoyed Weta Digital's work in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He also pointed out that the film would not be exclusively about action but will also focus on brotherhood, friendship, and responsibility.[26] | In late March 2012, Bay posted on his website explaining the title change and stressing that nothing had changed regarding the Turtles. He stated the reason the title was shortened was a request by Paramount to make the title \"simple\". He continued that the Turtles were the same as fans remember and regardless of the title change they still act like teenagers. He urged everyone to give everybody who was involved a chance, as they had the fans interest at top priority and would not let anybody down.[27] On June 12, 2012, Eastman revealed some of the things for the film stating that April would not be 16 years old like in the 2012 cartoon series, he feels Ken Watanabe would make a great Shredder, he would like to bring Reyes back as a Foot lieutenant, and martial arts wise they are looking at Fist of Legend and The Raid: Redemption.[28] Three days later, it was reported that production for this project had been shut down. While the release date had been pushed back five months, the work stoppage for the film was said to be \"indefinite\".[29] However, other sources said that the film would be released on May 16, 2014 due to problems in that script that need to be corrected.[30][31] In July 2012, Eastman called it \"easily the best Turtle movie yet\".[32] Kevin Eastman stated that the movie is creating its own story but has to be true to the source material or else they will get \"murdered\".[33] | In August 2012, an early version of the script, dated January 30, 2012, titled \"The Blue Door\" and written by Appelbaum and Nemec, was leaked online. It featured major changes to the origins: the Turtles hail from another dimension that consists of turtle warriors, Splinter is an alien from the same dimension as well, Shredder is \"Colonel Schrader\", a government agent who is secretly an alien who can grow blades from his body, \"The Foot Clan\" is just \"The Foot\", an elite Black Ops unit led by Col. Schrader, Casey Jones is an 18-year-old security guard/amateur ice hockey player that finds the Turtles and is the focus of the film, April is also 18 and is having relationship troubles with Casey because she is moving to New York due to an internship at CBS, Raphael is the comic relief instead of Michelangelo, and Michelangelo falls in love with a turtle woman from his home planet.[34] A cease and desist order was sent by Paramount Pictures to a website that was hosting the script.[35] Peter Laird read the script and commented on his blog that \"all true TMNT fans should be grateful to the new 'powers that be' that they did not allow this wretched thing to go any further.\"[36] In response to The Blue Door, Bay stated that the draft had been written before he and Platinum Dunes joined the project and was promptly rejected some time before.[37] On January 12, 2013, Production Weekly revealed the film would start filming in April 2013 in New York.[38][39] The following month, the studio pushed back the film's release date until June 6, 2014, and a new writer, Evan Daugherty, was brought on board.[40] On August 15, 2013, Paramount postponed the release date to August 8, 2014 in order to avoid competition with family-friendly films released in June 2014 as well as one of Paramount and Michael Bay's other releases, Transformers: Age of Extinction.[41] | In mid-February 2013, actress Megan Fox was reported to be cast as April O'Neil,[42] marking her first collaboration with Bay since her remark comparing him to Adolf Hitler.[43] Bay confirmed Fox is back in good terms with him as early as April 2011.[43] Jessica Biel had expressed interest in playing the part.[44] In regards to Fox's casting, Laird commented that he felt there were better choices to play April, but that he would prefer not to get too worked up over the issue.[45] | A month later, it was reported that Alan Ritchson, Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard and Noel Fisher were cast as Raphael, Leonardo, Donatello and Michelangelo respectively.[46][47] In early April, Will Arnett was cast in a role that was being kept secret until leaked photos revealed that he had been cast as April's cameraman and rival, Vern Fenwick.[48][49] Soon after that, actor Danny Woodburn joined the cast as Splinter.[50] | In early May, William Fichtner was cast in the film as a lead with iconic stature in the Turtles' mythology, marking his third collaboration with Bay following Armageddon and Pearl Harbor.[51] That same month, former Saturday Night Live star Abby Elliott was cast in the film.[52] Also, it was revealed that Whoopi Goldberg appeared on set, and that she is portraying Bernadette Thompson, a female version of Burne Thompson.[53] On June 22, 2013, instead of playing The Shredder, Fichtner revealed to the Huffington Post that he is playing a character named Eric Sacks.[54][55] In October 2013, William Fichtner revealed that Bebop and Rocksteady would not be appearing in the film.[56] In March 2014, it was revealed that Abby Elliott would be playing April O'Neil's roommate.[57] In April 2014, Elliott revealed that her character will be named Taylor, and on April 3, actors Johnny Knoxville and Tony Shalhoub joined the film to dub Ploszek and Woodbury as the voices of Leonardo and Splinter respectively.[58][59] | Principal photography commenced March 22, 2013 in Tupper Lake, New York.[60] Shooting began in April in New York City and at Jones Beach State Park in Wantagh on Long Island, New York under the code words \"four squared\" (4SQ).[61] On April 20, 2013, the film was renamed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[62] On April 29, 2013, Michael Bay retracted comments that the turtles would be aliens.[63] Early set photos were made public showing the turtles' actors in black and grey motion capture suits, complete with life-sized turtle shells, with each actor wearing arm bands and accents of their corresponding turtle's signature color.[64] Brazilian cinematographer Lula Carvalho, who was invited to work in the film during production of the 2014 remake of RoboCop, described the process as \"demanding much imagination and participation of the visual effects supervisor\", given that despite their presence on the set the actors would effectively be replaced by computer-generated creatures.[65] Production for the film wrapped on August 6, 2013.[66] Additional filming occurred in January and April 2014.[67][68][69] | The visual effects of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were handled by Industrial Light & Magic, who had previously worked with Michael Bay before, doing the special effects for the Transformers film series. To make sure the digital turtles had more nuanced facial expressions, the technicians employed a new motion capture system that captured the actors' faces with two high-definition cameras, which captured roughly 1 terabyte of data per day.[70] Along with a more realistic design, the effects artists wanted the Ninja Turtles to be \"charming, intimidating and individually recognizable\".[71] Thus each had a distinctive body figure resembling their personalities and physicality. According to effects supervisor Pablo Helman, “Donatello is more like a basketball player, Raph is more like a football player and Mikey is a very short Messi and plays soccer.”[72] | The film's score was composed by Brian Tyler. The soundtrack was released by Atlantic Records on August 5, 2014.","m_sequel":"Noel Fisher revealed in an interview that all four of the turtle actors have signed on for three films.[143] | Liebesman and Fuller have confirmed that Casey Jones as well as Bebop and Rocksteady will appear in the sequels.[144][145][146] There are also plans for Krang and Dimension X in the sequels as well.[147] On August 10, 2014, Paramount announced that a sequel will be released on June 3, 2016, with Michael Bay returning as producer and Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec coming back as screenwriters and executive producers.[6][7] Fox and Arnett returned in the sequel along with the character Shredder.[146] | In December 2014, it was revealed that Dave Green, director of Earth to Echo, is in talks to direct the sequel.[148][149] Green was confirmed as the film's director three months later.[150] In January 2015, Fuller and Form told that the sequel would start filming in New York and Buffalo in April 2015.[150][151][152] In March 2015, Victoria's Secret's supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio was cast as herself and a love interest to Vern, also Los Angeles Clippers and Charlotte Hornets players DeAndre Jordan, Matt Barnes, J.J. Redick, Austin Rivers and Spencer Hawes made cameos in the film. It was also announced that actor Stephen Amell has been cast as Casey Jones for the sequel.[153][154][155] In April 2015, Paramount officially confirmed that Bebop and Rocksteady would appear in the sequel and showed the first images of them at CinemaCon.[156] Variety announced that Tyler Perry was cast as Baxter Stockman and Brian Tee portrayed Shredder in the sequel.[157][158] In May 2015, Gary Anthony Williams and Stephen \"Sheamus\" Farrelly were cast as Bebop and Rocksteady respectively.[159][160] Brittany Ishibashi also replaced Noji as Karai in the sequel.[161] Johnny Knoxville did not return to voice Leonardo in the sequel as he was not asked to reprise the role.[162] Instead, Pete Ploszek did both motion-capture and voice.","m_based_on":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  by Peter Laird Kevin Eastman","m_directed_by":"Jonathan Liebesman","m_produced_by":"Michael Bay | Andrew Form | Brad Fuller | Galen Walker | Scott Mednick | Ian Bryce","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Megan Fox | Will Arnett | William Fichtner | Danny Woodburn | Noel Fisher | Jeremy Howard | Pete Ploszek | Alan Ritchson","m_music_by":"Brian Tyler","m_cinematography":"Lula Carvalho","m_edited_by":"Joel Negron | Glen Scantlebury","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"July 29, 2014 (2014-07-29) (Mexico City premiere)[1] | August 8, 2014 (2014-08-08) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"101 minutes[2][3]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$125 million[4]","m_box_office":"$493.3 million[4] | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 2014 American science fiction action comedy film based on the Mirage Studios characters of the same name, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Platinum Dunes, and distributed by Paramount Pictures.
