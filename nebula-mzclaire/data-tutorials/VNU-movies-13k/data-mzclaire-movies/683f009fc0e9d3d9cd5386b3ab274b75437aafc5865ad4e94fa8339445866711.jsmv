She was taught by UCLA student Bessie Nyi. She encountered problems in her communication with the extras on the set however, as she found out they were actually speaking a south Chinese dialect. In the film, she impersonates Ginger Rogers (with a life-sized male doll fixed to her toes), Eddie Cantor, and Al Jolson singing “Mammy”. In the first take, the elastic band of the dummy, which she named Tommy Wonder, snapped off her foot. In preparation for the Jolson imitation, she had to listen and watch Jolson, something she did not enjoy doing.[2] | Production of the movie was held up for close to four weeks while first Alice Faye then Shirley Temple came down with the flu.[3] | The dog in the film, a miniature Chinese Pekinese which was owned by the wife of a local photographer, was given to Temple and renamed Ching-Ching (after her character in the movie). Temple's mother worked out a trade in which Temple and her father would agree to pose for the photographer in exchange for the dog.[4] | Temple’s IQ was tested during the Stowaway period and found to be 155, the genius classification.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"William A.
