On the operating table, he briefly suffers clinical death, after which there appear to be two heartbeats on the monitor. When he awakes, Pelham finds his life has been turned upside-down; in his job as a director of a marine technology company he learns that he now supports a merger that he once opposed, and that he apparently is having an affair. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances claim to have seen him in places where he has never been, and Pelham starts being followed by a mysterious silver car (a Lamborghini Islero). Does Pelham have a doppelgänger or is he actually going insane?","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was one of the first greenlit by Bryan Forbes while he was head of EMI Films.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Basil Dearden","m_produced_by":"Michael Relph","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Roger Moore Hildegarde Neil","m_music_by":"Michael J.
