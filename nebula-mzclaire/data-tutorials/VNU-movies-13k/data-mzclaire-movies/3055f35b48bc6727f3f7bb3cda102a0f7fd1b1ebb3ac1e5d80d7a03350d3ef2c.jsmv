Catherine is a nun with the Children of the Lord, a mysterious heretical order based in Bavaria and founded by the excommunicated Roman Catholic priest Michael Rayner (Lee), where Beddows is allowed to come to visit Catherine only on her birthdays. But after Catherine arrives, Beddows then insists that she stay with Verney. The order, however, under Father Michael, makes all efforts to get Catherine back and uses black magic to stop Verney as he protects her. Verney learns that the order really harbours a group of practicing Satanists, who have prepared Catherine to become an avatar of Astaroth upon her eighteenth birthday. The priest kill Verneys friends and tries to later get Verney. Verney battles the priest and his henchmen and is able to rescue Catherine.","m_cast":"Richard Widmark as John Verney | Christopher Lee as Father Michael Rayner | Honor Blackman as Anna Fountain | Denholm Elliott as Henry Beddows | Michael Goodliffe as George De Grass | Nastassja Kinski as Catherine Beddows | Eva Maria Meineke as Eveline de Grass | Anthony Valentine as David Kennedy | Derek Francis as The Bishop | Constantine Gregory as Kollde | Brian Wilde as Black Room Attendant | Howard Goorney as Critic | Frances de la Tour as Salvation Army Major","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was adapted by Christopher Wicking and John Peacock from the 1953 novel of the same name by Dennis Wheatley.
