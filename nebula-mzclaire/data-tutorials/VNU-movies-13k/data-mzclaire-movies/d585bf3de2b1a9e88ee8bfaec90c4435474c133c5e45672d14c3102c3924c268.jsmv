{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sixteen-year-old Lynda Mansell (Emily Lloyd) lives in a small English seaside town in the early 1950s. She is feisty and precocious and tries to shock other people with her vulgar and saucy tongue (her favourite insult is \"Up yer bum\"). Bored with conventional jobs (which she frequently loses) and her town's dull young men, Lynda has her first sexual experience with Dave (Jesse Birdsall) but after she has slept with one of her father's middle-aged friends (Tom Bell), her life changes. She becomes pregnant and her father, a somewhat rigid and conventional man, disowns her. Desperately she tries to seek an illegal abortion but in the end decides to become a mother.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Wish You Were Here has an overall approval rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes.[4]","m_production":"The film was based loosely on the memoirs of the British madam Cynthia Payne as an adolescent growing up on the Sussex coast.[3] It was filmed in the West Sussex towns of Worthing and Bognor Regis.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Leland","m_produced_by":"Sarah Radclyffe","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Emily Lloyd | Tom Bell","m_music_by":"Stanley Myers","m_cinematography":"Ian Wilson","m_edited_by":"George Akers","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Atlantic Releasing Corp","m_release_dates":"24 July 1987 (1987-07-24) (U.S.) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"92 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"₤1.2 million[1] | Wish You Were Here is a 1987 British comedy-drama film starring Emily Lloyd and Tom Bell.
