Paramount ordered the producer to have Sinatra sing in the film with Hazlewood quickly composing a title song for her reminiscent of John Barry's Thunderball. The resulting song, \"The Last of the Secret Agents\", did not appear on the Pete King soundtrack album. | At the end of Nancy Sinatra's performance of the title song, she suffers a comic \"wardrobe malfunction\" leaving her only clad in bra, panties, stocking and heels. | Neal Hefti wrote the song You Are for Steve Rossi, which does appear on the soundtrack, as does the song \"Don Jose, Ole\" written by Tolkin and Abbott. | Sinatra's title song was reused as an end title song in Bill Murray's The Man Who Knew Too Little.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Allen & Rossi were a popular comedy team in their nightclub and television appearances, notably on The Ed Sullivan Show. Paramount Pictures had highly successful comedy teams of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in the 1940s and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in the 1950s and no doubt wished to recreate their success with the duo's screen debut in the film. (This proved not to be the case, and no sequels were produced for the film, although the duo did appear in the 1974 film Allen and Rossi Meet Dracula and Frankenstein.[3]) | Mel Tolkin had written for Your Show of Shows and had many other comedy credits, whilst Norman Abbott, the nephew of Bud Abbott, had the experience of directing many successful American television comedy shows.
