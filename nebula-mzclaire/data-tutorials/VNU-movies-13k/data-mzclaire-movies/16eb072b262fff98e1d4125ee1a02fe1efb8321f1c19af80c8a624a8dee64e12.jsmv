{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Beginning with a montage of bloopers entailing reporters losing their professional demeanor with cursing, freudian slips of sexual innuendos and ending with local channel KZLA6 (a likely parody of KTLA) segment reporter Meghan Miles (Elizabeth Banks) who has the undesired paranormal ability of turning cats psychotic towards her, being swarmed at an animal shelter, also an integral plot device. Meghan is being considered for an anchor position with the cnb network and her interview with network executives has her answering her final question, claiming \"I'm a good girl\". Two weeks after the interview, her producer, Dan Karlin (Willie Garson) receives a call that out-of-town Wendy Chang is being chosen over her, a likely tokenism requirement. Upset over her steady boyfriend leaving her and taking his stuff, her two friends Deanise (Sarah Wright) and Rose (Gillian Jacobs) take her out clubbing and Megan drinks heavily. Meghan wears Denise's yellow dress. Being locked out of the club on a fire escape from a one way door, Gordon (James Marsden), a handsome and charismatic man woos her and takes her to his place where they indulge in frat house-style games ending with Megan waking up in his bed in just her underwear. Receiving a call that Chang has racy pictures of her circulating and Megan is hired, has her collecting her clothes from around the place, she comes across a cat, with its eyes turning shiny. Trapping it under a box is futile as it reappears unrevealed. She flees the place with just her car keys, leaving behind her phone. Outside, her car is towed past her with her purse inside and the call buttons to the buildings residents is just numbers. She walks down the street, coming across an off duty taxi, but strongly insisting that he drive her to the \"tow-to place\", referring to the impound lot. He reluctantly does, instead driving her to the Tattoo strip club, Megan refusing to give in to his demand of \"dances\" has her dashing away, starting her slew of a misinterpreted crime spree of a hooker to gang member and other mishaps by the police force. While she walks through the streets Meghan is questioned by the police, as they think she is a hooker; she is given a warning and is left alone . Meghan meets some strange men who help her call her ex boyfriend but the men engage in a gun fight on the streets; Meghan feels happy she is having a fun time and starts laughing with one of the men. The same policemen who cautioned Meghan Coke to find her.","m_cast":"Elizabeth Banks as Meghan Miles | James Marsden as Gordon | Gillian Jacobs as Rose | Sarah Wright as Denise | Ethan Suplee as Officer Dave | Oliver Hudson as Kyle | Willie Garson as Dan Karlin | Kevin Nealon as Chopper Steve | Bill Burr as Officer Walter | Vic Chao as Shift Captain | Larry Gilliard, Jr. as Scrilla | Ken Davitian as Immigrant CAB driver | P.
