It tells the cross-cut tale of two men, Abu Jandal and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, whose meeting launched them on juxtaposed paths with al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the September 11 attacks, US military tribunals and the U.S. Supreme Court. The film is the second of a trilogy, with the first being My Country, My Country (2006), documenting the lives of Iraqi citizens during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. The third, Citizenfour (2014), focuses on the NSA's domestic surveillance programs. The Oath is distributed both theatrically and non-theatrically in the US by New York-based Zeitgeist Films. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ John H, Cushman, Jr. (2012-10-16). \"Appeals Court Overturns Terrorism Conviction of Bin Laden’s Driver\".
