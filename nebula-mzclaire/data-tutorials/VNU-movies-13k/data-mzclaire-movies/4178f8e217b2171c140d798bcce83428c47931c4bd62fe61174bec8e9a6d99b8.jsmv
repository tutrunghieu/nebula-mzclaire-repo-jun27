{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film stars Liza Minnelli as the title character Junie Moon, a girl whose face is scarred in a vicious battery acid attack by her boyfriend (Ben Piazza). Later in an institution, she meets a man with epilepsy (Ken Howard), and a gay paraplegic who uses a wheelchair (Robert Moore). Disabled, but not down, they live together in an older, rented house and bond, determined to prove themselves and to help each other.[2] | Unlike Liza Minnelli's previous film, 1969's The Sterile Cuckoo, which was a triumph artistically and financially, as well as netting Minnelli an Oscar nomination as Best Actress, Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon was a quick and resounding failure with critics and at the box office. It was virtually forgotten. Minnelli's next film two years later, Cabaret, would not only win her the Academy Award but also establish her as a superstar.","m_cast":"Liza Minnelli as Junie Moon | Ken Howard as Arthur | Robert Moore as Warren | James Coco as Mario | Kay Thompson as Miss Gregory | Fred Williamson as Beach Boy | Ben Piazza as Jesse | Emily Yancy as Solana | Leonard Frey as Guiles | Clarice Taylor as Minnie | James Beard as Sidney Wyner | Julie Bovasso as Ramona | Gina Collens as Lila | Barbara Logan as Mother Moon | Nancy Marchand as Nurse Oxford | Lynn Milgrim as Nurse Holt | Ric O'Feldman as Joebee | James D.
