{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1982, a shady transaction is occurring between an East German scientist, Dr. Krause, and a group of Americans. It is revealed that MM88 is a deadly virus, created accidentally by an American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the MM88, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the virus is released, creating a pandemic initially known as the \"Italian Flu\". | Within seven months, virtually all the world's population has died off. But the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius, and the polar winter has spared the 855 men and eight women stationed in Antarctica. The British nuclear submarine HMS Nereid joins the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew attempt to make landfall near Palmer Station. | However, just as the group begins to repopulate their new home, it is revealed that an earthquake will activate the Automated Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States nuclear arsenal. | The Soviets have their own version of the ARS that will fire off their weapons in return, including one targeted at Palmer Station. Yoshizumi and Major Carter embark aboard the Nereid on a mission to shut down the ARS, protected from MM88 by an experimental vaccine. | The submarine arrives at Washington, D.C. and Yoshizumi and Carter make a rush for the ARS command bunker. They reach the room too late and all but a few of the survivors (who left aboard an icebreaker at the same time as the Nereid) perish in the nuclear exchange. Over the course of years Yoshizumi walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching Tierra del Fuego in 1988,[2] he encounters the survivors from the icebreaker.","m_cast":"Masao Kusakari as Yoshizumi | Sonny Chiba as Dr. Yamauchi | Glenn Ford as President Richardson | George Kennedy as Admiral Conway | Robert Vaughn as Senator Barkley | Chuck Connors as Captain McCloud | Bo Svenson as Major Carter | Olivia Hussey as Marit | Henry Silva as General Garland | Isao Natsuyagi as Commander Nakanishi | Stephanie Faulkner as Sarah Baker | Stuart Gillard as Dr. Meyer | Cec Linder as Dr. Latour | George Touliatos as Colonel Rankin | Chris Wiggins as Dr. Borodinov | Edward James Olmos as Captain Lopez","m_reception":"The film was a box office bomb despite its enormous budget. Although it may have had some special showings in the United States and elsewhere, it did not receive a general release. It was sold directly to pay television and edited down to a 108-minute version. This cut left out much of the love story between Yoshizumi and Marit, and nearly all the Japanese scenes including Yoshizumi's entire trek back towards Antarctica. The cut left out nearly all character development for Yoshizumi as well. It also starts off with the meeting in East Germany between Doctor Krause and Rankin's agents, while the Nereid's arrival in Tokyo Bay was moved to much later in the film. Some versions even end with the nuclear explosions, leaving the film with a quite pessimistic outcome as opposed to the Japanese version's optimistic ending.[4]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Virus  by Sakyo Komatsu","m_directed_by":"Kinji Fukasaku","m_produced_by":"Haruki Kadokawa","m_screenplay_by":"Kinji Fukasaku Kōji Takada Gregory Knapp","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Masao Kusakari Sonny Chiba Glenn Ford Chuck Connors","m_music_by":"Kentaro Haneda Janis Ian Teo Macero","m_cinematography":"Daisaku Kimura","m_edited_by":"Akira Suzuki","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Toho","m_release_dates":"June 26, 1980 (1980-06-26) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"156 minutes","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"English Japanese","m_budget":"¥ 3,351,000,000 (approx. at 1980s rates) $16 million | Virus (復活の日 Fukkatsu no hi?), literally \"Day of Resurrection\", is a 1980 Japanese post-apocalyptic science fiction film directed by Kinji Fukasaku,[1] based on the 1964 novel of the same name by Sakyo Komatsu.
