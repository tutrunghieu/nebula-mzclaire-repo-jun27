According to some sources, Wang Yu directed parts of the film.[4] Trenchard Smith says Yu was difficult to deal with and shooting was hard - \"there was a great clash of personalities, coupled with the inevitable mutual distrust that occurs in a co-production where both sides think the other is trying to rip them off.\"[1] However he says John Fraser of Greater Union was very supportive and encouraging. The film s team of producers also included the late David Hannay. | Trenchard-Smith received nine offers of co-production after the film's release.[5] | The film was originally costed at $450,000 but the budget increased when the producers wanted more action sequences and a hit song on the soundtrack. British band Jigsaw recorded 'Sky High' which was used over the opening credits. It went number one in several countries.[1] Production funding came from Greater Union, Golden Harvest and the Australian Film Development Corporation. (The film's production company, The Movie Company, was owned 50% by Trenchard-Smith and 50% by Greater Union,) | Wang Yu was injured in a hang gliding sequence whilst Lazenby had severe burns on his hands during a fight scene.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Brian Trenchard-Smith","m_produced_by":"John Fraser Raymond Chow","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jimmy Wang Yu George Lazenby Rosalind Speirs Frank Thring Hugh Keays-Byrne Roger Ward Sammo Hung Rebecca Gilling Grant Page Bill Hunter","m_music_by":"Noel Quinlan","m_cinematography":"Russell Boyd","m_edited_by":"Peter Cheung Ron Williams","m_production_company":"The Movie Company Golden Harvest","m_distributed_by":"Cathay (Asia) British Empire Films (Australia) Rank (UK) 20th Century Fox (USA)","m_release_dates":"31 July 1975 (1975-07-31) (Hong Kong) | August 1975 (1975-08) (U.S.) | 5 September 1975 (1975-09-05) (Australia) |  | ","m_running_time":"111 minutes","m_country":"Hong Kong Australia","m_language":"English","m_budget":"A$550,000[1]","m_box_office":"A$1.1 million (Australia)[2] | The Man from Hong Kong (known in the U.S.A. as The Dragon Flies) is a 1975 action film that marked the first Australian-Hong Kong co-production filmed in both nations.
