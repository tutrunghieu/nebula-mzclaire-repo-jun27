{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Eons ago, Bor, father of Odin, clashes with the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the Aether on the nine realms. After conquering Malekith's forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unbeknownst to Bor, Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim, and a handful of Dark Elves escape into suspended animation. | In present-day Asgard, Loki stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth.1 Meanwhile, Thor, alongside warriors Fandral, Volstagg, and Sif, repel marauders on Vanaheim, home of their comrade Hogun; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the Nine Realms following the reconstruction of the Bifröst, the \"Rainbow Bridge\" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier.2 The Asgardians soon learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random. | In London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Jane, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Jane, but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. | Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Jane, sensing that she contains the Aether. Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith and Algrim are forced to flee without Jane. Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Jane to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Jane head to Svartalfheim. | There, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterwards, Thor and Jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Darcy and Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig — who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship. | Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin's offer to take the throne and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin's form transforms into Loki, who is alive and impersonating Odin. | In a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the Collector and entrust the Aether to his care, commenting that with the Tesseract already in Asgard, having two Infinity Stones so close together would be dangerous. As they leave, the Collector remarks, \"One down, five to go.\" In a post-credits scene, Jane and Thor reunite on Earth while somewhere in London a frost monster from Jotunheim, accidentally transported to Earth during the final battle, continues to run amok.","m_cast":"Chris Hemsworth as Thor: | Natalie Portman as Jane Foster: | Tom Hiddleston as Loki: | Anthony Hopkins as Odin: | Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig: | Idris Elba as Heimdall: | Christopher Eccleston as Malekith: | Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim / Kurse: | Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis: | Ray Stevenson as Volstagg: | Zachary Levi as Fandral: | Tadanobu Asano as Hogun: | Jaimie Alexander as Sif: | Rene Russo as Frigga: | Additionally, Alice Krige portrays Eir, an Asgardian physician.[45] Chris O'Dowd was cast as Richard,[46][47] a suitor of Jane Foster's.

The website's consensus reads, \"It may not be the finest film to come from the Marvel Universe, but Thor: The Dark World still offers plenty of the humor and high-stakes action that fans have come to expect.\"[143] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 54 out of 100 based on 44 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[144] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A-\" average, based on a grading scale ranging from A+ to F.[135] | Ben Child of The Guardian said, \"Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's impressive collective charisma, Thor: The Dark World is far from a franchise killer.\"[145] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \"This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements.\"[146] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said, \"Thor: The Dark World delivers the goods—action, otherworldly grandiosity, romance, humor—above and beyond its predecessor\".[147] Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com said, \"There's just enough tension and humor in Thor: The Dark World to make the film's otherwise listless proceedings worth watching, but only just.\"[148] Echoing other critics' sentiments, Frank Lovece of Film Journal International wrote, \"Is it wrong that the best relationship in Thor: The Dark World is between the titular Norse-god superhero and his adoptive brother Loki? To take nothing away from Oscar-winner Natalie Portman, ... it's the complicated love-hate between Thor and the trickster god Loki that you can't turn your eyes from.\"[149] | Conversely, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph said, \"It feels entirely made by committee—the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight.\"[150] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Although director Alan Taylor manages to get things going properly for the final battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag, like filler episodes of Game of Thrones but without the narrative complexity, mythical heft or all-pervading sexiness.\"[151] Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times described Thor: The Dark World as having the \"same old threats of galaxy annihilation spiced with fairly entertaining fish-out-of-water jokes\".[152] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said, \"the battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story\".[153] | The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences placed Thor: The Dark World on its shortlist of potential nominees for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects but ultimately did not nominate it for the award.[154]","m_production":"\"In both cases, it's using the conceit of a fantastical, alien world to make fresh what is really a domestic drama. In Game of Thrones, seeing Tyrion battle with his sister Cersei, seeing the relationships between children and their fathers... It's all the stuff we're interested in at a psychological level because we're living it all the time. But it takes place in this otherwise fantastical, foreign realm. I think the same thing is true in Thor. The brilliant thing Ken Branagh did in launching it was making it very much a story about two brothers, a story about brothers competing for the love of their father. So it's small, confined and human at the same time it's this blown-out, intergalactic world.\" | In April 2011 before the release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), \"Thor will go off into a new adventure.\"[59] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, \"It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether there should be a second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [among] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true\".[60] Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, \"Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [Branagh] to discuss coming back, but right now the focus is on the first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky\".[61] | In June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, release date for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising his role as the title hero. It was also reported that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity.[6] The Los Angeles Times cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects-heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh's departure, although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel.[62] Branagh noted, \"It was a long time [making the first film] and they were way too quick for me to get straight back into another, [but] it was a pleasurable experience and a film I'm very proud of.\"[63] The following day, Marvel formally hired Payne, one of the credited writers of the first film, to script the sequel.[64] In August, Brian Kirk entered early negotiations to direct the Thor sequel. The film would have marked Kirk's first time directing a big-budget motion picture, after having directed television series for HBO, Showtime and the BBC, including Game of Thrones.[65] | In September 2011, Tom Hiddleston confirmed he would return in the sequel, speculating that in the film, \"[Loki will] have to take responsibility for what he's done\".[16] Patty Jenkins, the director of Monster and the pilot episode of AMC's The Killing, entered early negotiations with Marvel Studios and Disney to direct the film, after Kirk had passed due to contractual sticking points that arose during negotiations.[66] Later in the month, Feige stated the sequel would \"take Thor literally to other worlds\" and would \"primarily be the journey of that character, of he and Jane Foster and how the new dynamic with his father is working out, as well as what are the broader stakes for The Nine Worlds\".[67] On October 13, 2011, Marvel confirmed that Jenkins would direct the sequel and Natalie Portman would return to star.[10] Disney also moved the release date for the film to November 15, 2013.[68] | \"The main difference I have [from Branagh's approach] is really to do with look and tone. Things look really dirty. The first Thor was quite shiny and it was a very conscious, smart choice. When I came in, I wanted to get more of a sense of the Norse mythology: the Viking quality, the texture and weight of the history. He’s a superhero, but he’s been around for thousands of years. His dad is god!\" | In December 2011, Jenkins exited the project, citing \"creative differences\".[69] She stated, \"I have had a great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again.\"[70] Three days later, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins. THR also reported that Marvel was in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script and the shortlist of possible writers consists of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary.[71] At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel.[72] Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying \"With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm.\"[14] | By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012.[73][74] Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August.[75][76] Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating \"I think the science fiction element to Thor … the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard is going to make it all the more special and that's what Alan [Taylor] wants to bring to it.\"[75] Feige said \"while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [after the events of the movie The Avengers] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost.\" Feige also said that while Loki has a part, \"there will be a different villain, another big villain\".[76] | In May 2012, Mads Mikkelsen began talks to play one of the villains in the film and Anthony Hopkins, who played Odin in the first film, committed to returning in the sequel.[21][77] At the end of the month, Disney moved up the release date for the film a week ahead of the previous date to November 8, 2013.[78] | By June 2012, much of the first film's supporting cast was confirmed to return, including Idris Elba,[24] Jaimie Alexander,[40] Ray Stevenson[34] and Stellan Skarsgård.[22] Also in June, Joshua Dallas announced that he would not be reprising the role of Fandral.[79] Dallas had initially intended to return,[80] but had to bow out due to his commitment on the television show, Once Upon a Time,[79] and Zachary Levi was cast in his place.[36] Levi was originally up for the role in the first film but scheduling conflicts with Chuck forced him to drop out.[37] | In July 2012, Mikkelsen stated he would not be appearing in the sequel due to prior commitments, \"That's not happening unfortunately. I had a meeting with [the filmmakers], but it was a bit too late and then Hannibal came in...It's just not happening\".[81] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, it was announced that the film would be titled Thor: The Dark World.[82] At the end of the month, residents near Bourne Wood in Surrey, England were notified that a film going by the working title, Thursday Mourning would be filming in the area.[83][84] | In August of that year, Christopher Eccleston entered final negotiations to play Malekith the Accursed,[26] and the film was scheduled to shoot in Iceland, where Taylor shot parts of Game of Thrones.[85] By August 22, Kat Dennings was hired to reprise her role as Darcy Lewis and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast as Algrim.[29][33] At the end of the month, film crews for Thursday Mourning began set construction at Stonehenge near Amesbury, England.[86] | Principal photography began on September 10, 2012, in Bourne Wood, Surrey, England.[87] A few weeks later, Clive Russell was cast as Tyr, and Richard Brake was cast as an Einherjar captain.[55] At the end of the month, Jaimie Alexander was injured on the London film set, after she slipped while walking in the rain.[88] On October 12, 2012, production moved to Iceland with filming taking place in Dómadalur, Skógafoss, Fjaðrárgljúfur and Skeiðarársandur. Iceland Review described the shoot as being among the most extensive film projects to have ever taken place in Iceland.[89] Three days later, Disney announced that the film would be released in 3D.[90] In late October, filming commenced at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London.[91] Filming also took place at Shepperton Studios and Longcross Studios in Surrey between October and December 2012.[14][92] Other filming locations included Wembley, Borough Market, Hayes and Stonehenge.[14] Alexander tweeted that principal photography wrapped on December 14, 2012.[93] Disney spent $237.6 million on Thor: The Dark World but $37 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority.[94] | Kramer Morgenthau, who worked with Taylor on Game of Thrones, was brought in as the director of photography. Morgenthau said, \"We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on Game of Thrones. We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, while at the same time respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme.\" Thor: The Dark World was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the Arri Alexa Plus, although he tested with the Sony F65 but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, Red Epic and Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras were used for second unit filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used Panavision anamorphic lenses. Morgenthau said, \"The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look.\" Morgenthau also stated that Thor: The Dark World was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, \"It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. You do a lot more prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages. Part of it is having a really good crew—it's definitely not a one-man show.\"[95] | In July 2013, Dennings told reporters that the film was about to head into reshoots.[96] In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston and was about to shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor explained that it was all a part of the \"Marvel process\" saying, \"We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [involving Loki] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So it was that kind of thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff.\"[97] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.[98] | Taylor said Marvel's The Avengers writer/director Joss Whedon rewrote several scenes in the film explaining, \"Joss came in to save our lives a couple of times. We had a major scene that was not working on the page at all in London, and he basically got airlifted in, like a SWAT team or something. He came down, rewrote the scene, and before he got back to his plane I sort of grabbed him and said, 'And this scene and this scene?' And he rewrote two other scenes that I thought had problems.\"[99] In October 2013, Tony Curran tweeted that he would be portraying Odin's father, Bor, in a flashback sequence.[53][54] In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the \"Loki trilogy\", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout Thor, The Avengers and this film.[100] The film's mid-credits scene was directed by James Gunn, the director of Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy.[48][101] | The film's visual effects were completed by seven special effects studios, including Double Negative and Luma Pictures.[102] Blur Studio was the lead studio behind the film's prologue sequence taking place 5,000 years before the start of the film, on the Dark Elves homeworld of Svartalfheim. The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.[103] | Taylor wanted Asgard in this film to have a more natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, capturing six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"The benefit of that is that you have some real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings.\"[103] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.[103] | For the shot of the levitating truck, which was used in the film to demonstrate the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement.[103] In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.[103] | The film's climatic battle sequence takes place through the nine worlds by the use of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, \"We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted to do was to make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on.\"[103]","m_sequel":"Thor: Ragnarok is scheduled to be released on November 3, 2017,[164] directed by Taika Waititi.[165] Stephany Folsom will write the screenplay,[166] with Kevin Feige again producing.[167] Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Alexander, Hopkins and Elba will reprise their roles as Thor, Loki, Sif, Odin, and Heimdall, respectively,[168][169][170][165] while Mark Ruffalo will appear as Bruce Banner / Hulk reprising his role from previous MCU films.[171] Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban join the cast as Hela, Valkyrie, Grandmaster, and Skurge, respectively.[165]","m_based_on":"Thor  by Stan Lee Larry Lieber Jack Kirby","m_directed_by":"Alan Taylor","m_produced_by":"Kevin Feige","m_screenplay_by":"Christopher Yost | Stephen McFeely | Christopher Markus","m_story_by":"Don Payne | Robert Rodat","m_starring":"Chris Hemsworth | Natalie Portman | Tom Hiddleston | Anthony Hopkins | Stellan Skarsgård | Idris Elba | Christopher Eccleston | Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje | Kat Dennings | Ray Stevenson | Zachary Levi | Tadanobu Asano | Jaimie Alexander | Rene Russo","m_music_by":"Brian Tyler","m_cinematography":"Kramer Morgenthau","m_edited_by":"Dan Lebental | Wyatt Smith","m_production_company":"Marvel Studios","m_distributed_by":"Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 22, 2013 (2013-10-22) (Leicester Square) | November 8, 2013 (2013-11-08) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"112 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$170 million[2]","m_box_office":"$644.6 million[2] | Thor: The Dark World is a 2013 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Thor and the eighth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by Alan Taylor, with a screenplay by Christopher Yost and Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely.[3] It stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Idris Elba, Christopher Eccleston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Kat Dennings, Ray Stevenson, Zachary Levi, Tadanobu Asano, Jaimie Alexander, and Rene Russo. In Thor: The Dark World, Thor teams up with Loki to save the Nine Realms from the Dark Elves led by the vengeful Malekith, who intends to plunge the universe into darkness. | Development of Thor: The Dark World began in April 2011, when producer Kevin Feige announced plans for a sequel to follow the crossover film The Avengers. In July 2011, Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor, withdrew from the project. Brian Kirk and Patty Jenkins were considered to direct the film before Taylor was hired in January 2012. The supporting cast filled out in August 2012, with the hiring of Eccleston, Dennings, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Principal photography began in September 2012 in Surrey, England with filming continuing in Iceland and London, before wrapping up in December 2012. Thor: The Dark World was converted to 3D in post-production. | Thor: The Dark World premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on October 22, 2013.
