{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jerome Littlefield (Lewis) is an orderly at the Whitestone Sanatorium and Hospital who suffers from \"neurotic identification empathy\"—a psychosomatic problem that causes him to suffer the symptoms of others and interferes with his ability to function effectively on the job. His unwitting propensity for slapstick-style mayhem sorely tries the patience of Dr. Howard (Glenda Farrell) and Nurse Higgins (Kathleen Freeman). | When his high school crush Susan Andrews (Susan Oliver) is admitted to the hospital after a suicide attempt, Jerome gradually comes to the realization that his problem is a result of his years-long obsession with her. While he fails to establish a romantic relationship with Susan, he does lift her spirits, thus banishing any thought of suicide and giving her the will to live. | A runaway gurney is chased by several ambulances and causes the destruction of ceiling-high canned goods displays in a grocery store. Littlefield is cured of his problem, reunited with his girlfriend Julie (Karen Sharpe), and looking forward to resuming his interrupted medical school career.","m_cast":"Jerry Lewis as Jerome Littlefield | Susan Oliver as Susan | Kathleen Freeman as Nurse Higgins | Glenda Farrell as Dr. Howard | Karen Sharpe as Julie | Alice Pearce as Patient | Barbara Nichols as Patient | Jack E.
