{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The plot revolves around a fictitious Onion television news anchorman, Norm Archer (Len Cariou), who is forced to face the inevitability of a corporate takeover by the Onion's perennial fictitious multinational, Global Tetrahedron. Onion news is described as \"fair and balanced\" in the context of the film. The plot serves as a springboard for various comedy sketches featuring The Onion's satirical humor. Vignettes include parodies of music videos reminiscent of Britney Spears' work, and Steven Seagal appearing as a parody of the type of action hero he normally portrays. The film is interrupted (fictitiously) by film reviewers and commentators weighing in on the progress of the film, with one commentator preparing to stage an immediate walkout of all African American audience members unless a positive portrayal of an African American is inserted into the film.","m_cast":"Len Cariou as Norm Archer | Larissa Laskin as Dana Dobbs | Scott Klace as Kip Kendall | Steven Seagal as Cock Puncher | Sarah McElligott as Melissa Cherry | Brendan Fletcher as Tim, a white black guy | Richard Fancy as Kenneth Garber | Murphy Dunne as Raymond Marcus | Alex Solowitz as The Masses | Paul Scheer as Dirk, a Bates computer salesman | Nick Chinlund as Bryce Brand | Jim Rash as Bryce's manager | Jed Rees as Wizard proteus | Greg Pitts as Wizards dragonmaster | Greg Cipes as Hippie diplomant | Yevgeni Lazarev as Slovesevic | Adam Gregor as Birajko | Ahmed Ahmed as Ahmed | Kevin Federline as Lollipop Love dancer | Robert Hoffman as Lollipop Love dancer | Meredith Baxter as chef on cooking show | Erik Stolhanske as producer | Michael Bolton as himself | Rodney Dangerfield as himself","m_reception":null,"m_production":"In 2003, New Regency Productions and Fox Searchlight Pictures were on board to produce and release a movie written by The Onion staff.
