Romero. The two had previously worked together on the immensely popular Dawn of the Dead in 1978. The film is split into two separate tales, both based largely on the works of Edgar Allan Poe: \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\", directed by Romero and starring Adrienne Barbeau, showcases his traditional mix of horror with social commentary, especially capitalism; and \"The Black Cat\", directed by Argento and starring Harvey Keitel, which blends a number of Poe references into a new narrative. Both of the tales were filmed in and take place in contemporary Pittsburgh. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"Two Evil Eyes at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/TwoEvilEyes.jpg/220px-TwoEvilEyes.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Dario Argento Franco Ferrini George A.
