Nugent wrote for The New York Times that the work of actors Pat O'Brien and Roland Young, had \"been a labor of love and the film has profited accordingly.\" In noting that the plot centered on \"the theatre and some of the curious folk who inhabit it\", the newspaper's review stated that the film had an acceptable sentimentality and shared that the story was \"an uncommonly interesting study of a man's mind, subtly written and directed, presented with honesty and commendable sincerity by Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Young and Olympe Bradna, and well worth any one's attention.\" The only objection in the review was that the stage play Laughter, the piece being produced within the film by O'Brien's character of Dan O'Farrell, \"seemed to be the most awful tripe.\"[1]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lewis Milestone","m_produced_by":"George M.
