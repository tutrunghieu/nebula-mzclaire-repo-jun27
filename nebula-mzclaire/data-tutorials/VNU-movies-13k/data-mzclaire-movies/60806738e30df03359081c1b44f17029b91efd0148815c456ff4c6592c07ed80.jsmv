{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Returning to his Bronx home following World War II, Timmy Cleary (Martin Sheen) discovers his middle class parents have drifted apart and constantly quarrel at the least provocation. Once closer to his mother Nettie (Patricia Neal), the young veteran finds himself bonding with his salesman father John (Jack Albertson), but he tries to remain neutral when intervening in their disputes. | En route home after a day trip to the family's summer cottage with his father, Timmy purchases a bouquet of roses and suggests John present them to his wife. Nettie is thrilled by his apparent thoughtfulness, and the three spend the evening nightclubbing in Manhattan. When an inebriated John, whose infidelities have already been revealed, attempts to make love to his wife later that night, Nettie rejects his advances, suggesting he go to \"one of his whores\", and breaks the vase of flowers, prompting her husband to reveal it really was Timmy who bought them. | The following morning, while John is at Sunday Mass, Timmy accuses his mother of trying to make him choose between his parents, and she goes out to allow both of them time to calm down. When she returns, she finds John arguing with their half-drunk son. Realizing the domestic situation is not likely to improve, Timmy announces he is leaving home, a decision his parents grudgingly accept. When he changes his mind, his father insists he stick to his plan, and the three eat breakfast together before he departs.","m_cast":"Patricia Neal as Nettie Cleary | Jack Albertson as John Cleary | Martin Sheen as Timmy Cleary | Don Saxon as Nightclub M.C. | Elaine Williams as Woman in Club | Grant Gordon as Man in Restaurant","m_reception":null,"m_production":"This was the first film directed by Ulu Grosbard, who had been nominated for the Tony Award for his direction of the 1964 Broadway production of Frank D. Gilroy's play.[2] Joining him were original cast members Jack Albertson and Martin Sheen as John and Timmy Cleary; Patricia Neal replaced Irene Dailey in the role of Nettie. | The film was a significant comeback for Neal, who was recovering from a debilitating stroke she had suffered three years earlier and hadn't appeared on screen since In Harm's Way in 1965. During filming, the actress was beset with memory problems and physical limitations she struggled to overcome, and in her autobiography As I Am, she described the experience as a career milestone that convinced her she still was a good actress. She also discussed her effort to memorize a five-page monologue she was required to do in one take and her pride at doing so successfully.[3] | The film was shot on location in New York City, Spring Lake, New Jersey, and Belmar, New Jersey (the Belmar Fishing Club). | The soundtrack includes \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\" (written by Sandy Denny) and \"Albatross,\" both performed by Judy Collins (who wrote the latter song).","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Subject Was Roses 1964 novel  by Frank D.
