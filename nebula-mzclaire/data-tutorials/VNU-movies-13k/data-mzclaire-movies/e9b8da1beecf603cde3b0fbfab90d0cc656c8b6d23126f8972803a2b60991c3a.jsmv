{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After a volcanic eruption on Daikoku Island, the Yahata-Maru Japanese fishing vessel is caught in strong currents off its shores. As the boat drifts into shore, the island begins to erupt, and a giant monster lifts itself out of the volcano. A few days later, reporter Goro Maki is sailing in the area and finds the vessel intact but deserted. As he explores the vessel, he finds all the crew dead except for one young man called Hiroshi Okamura, who has been badly wounded. Suddenly a giant Shockirus sea louse attacks him but he is saved by Okamura. | In Tokyo, Okamura realizes by looking at pictures that the monster he saw was a new Godzilla. Maki writes an article about the account, but the news of Godzilla's return is kept secret and his article is withheld. Maki visits Professor Hayashida, whose parents were lost in the 1954 Godzilla attack. Hayashida describes Godzilla as a living, invincible nuclear weapon able to cause mass destruction. At Hayashida's laboratory, Maki meets Okamura's sister, Naoko, and informs her that her brother is alive and at the police hospital. | A Soviet submarine is destroyed in the Pacific. The Soviets believe the attack was perpetrated by the Americans, and a diplomatic crisis ensues, which threatens to escalate into nuclear war. The Japanese intervene and reveal that Godzilla was behind the attacks. The Japanese cabinet meets to discuss Japan's defence. A new weapon is revealed, the Super X, a specially-armored flying fortress that will defend the capital. The Japanese military is put on alert. | Godzilla attacks the Ihama nuclear power plant. While Godzilla is feeding off the reactor, he is distracted by a flock of birds and leaves the facility. Hayashida believes that Godzilla was distracted instinctively by a homing signal from the birds. Hayashida, together with geologist Minami, propose to the Japanese Cabinet, that Godzilla could be lured back to Mt. Mihara on Oshima Island by a similar signal, and a volcanic eruption could be started, capturing Godzilla. | Prime Minister Mitamura meets with Soviet and American envoys and declares that nuclear weapons will not be used on Godzilla, even if it were to attack the Japanese mainland. Meanwhile, the Soviets have their own plans to counter the threat posed by Godzilla, and a Soviet control ship disguised as a freighter in Tokyo Harbor prepares to launch a nuclear missile from one of their orbiting satellites should Godzilla attack. | Godzilla is sighted at dawn in Tokyo Bay heading towards Tokyo, causing mass evacuations. Godzilla soon emerges and makes short work of the JSDF stationed there. The battle causes damage to the Soviet ship and starts a missile launch count-down. The captain dies as he attempts to stop the missile from launching. Godzilla proceeds towards Tokyo's business district, wreaking havoc along the way. There, it is confronted by four laser-armed trucks and the Super X. Because Godzilla's heart is similar to a nuclear reactor, the cadmium shells that are fired into his mouth by the Super X seal and slow down his heart, knocking him unconscious. | The count-down ends and the Soviet missile is launched. The Americans intervene and fire a counter-missile at the Soviet missile. Hayashida and Okamura are extracted from Tokyo via helicopter and taken to Mt. Mihara to set up the homing device before the two missiles collide above Tokyo. The two missiles collide, producing an electrical storm and an EMP, which revives Godzilla once more and temporarily disables the Super X. | Godzilla finally destroys the Super X and continues its rampage, until Hayashida uses the homing device to distract it. Godzilla leaves Tokyo and swims across the Japanese sea, following the homing device to Mt. Mihara. There, Godzilla follows the device and falls into the mouth of the volcano. Okamura activates detonators at the volcano, creating a controlled eruption that traps Godzilla inside.","m_cast":"Ken Tanaka as Goro Maki | Yasuko Sawaguchi as Naoko Okumura | Yosuke Natsuki as Professor Makoto Hayashida | Keiju Kobayashi as Prime Minister Seiki Mitamura | Shin Takuma as Hiroshi Okumura | Eitaro Ozawa as Minister of Finance Kanzaki | Hiroshi Koizumi as Professor Minami | Mizuho Suzuki as Minister of Foreign Affairs Seiichi Emori | Taketoshi Naito as Chief Cabinet Secretary Takegami | Yoshifumi Tajima as Minister of the Environment Hidaka | Kenpachiro Satsuma as Godzilla","m_reception":"In 1985, the film won the Japan Academy Award for Special Effects.[8] WatchMojo.com listed The Return of Godzilla as #8 on their \"Top 10 Godzilla Movies\" list.[9]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"\"The Resurrection of Godzilla\"  by Tomoyuki Tanaka[1]","m_directed_by":"Koji Hashimoto[1]","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":"Shuichi Nagahara[1]","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Keiju Kobayashi | Ken Tankaka | Yasuko Sawaguchi | Shin Takuma | Yosuke Natsuki","m_music_by":"Reijiro Koroku[1]","m_cinematography":"Kautami Hara[1]","m_edited_by":"Yoshitami Kuroiwa[1]","m_production_company":"Toho[1]","m_distributed_by":"Toho","m_release_dates":"December 15, 1984 (1984-12-15) (Japan) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"103 minutes[1]","m_country":"Japan","m_language":null,"m_budget":"$6.25 million","m_box_office":"$11 million | The Return of Godzilla, released in Japan as Godzilla (ゴジラ, Gojira?, also known as Godzilla 1984),[2] is a 1984 Japanese science fiction kaiju film directed by Koji Hashimoto and a reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise. It is the 16th film in the franchise and the first film in the Heisei series, despite the film having been produced during the Shōwa period. The film serves as direct sequel to the original 1954 Godzilla film, completely ignoring the events of the Shōwa series, which saw the franchise return to the darker tone and themes of the 1954 film and returned Godzilla to his destructive antagonistic roots. Other than Godzilla series creator Tomoyuki Tanaka and special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano, few people involved in prior Godzilla productions were involved in the making of the film. | In 1985, New World Pictures released Godzilla 1985, a heavily re-edited American adaptation of the film which included additional footage, which featured Raymond Burr reprising his role from Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, which was also produced, filmed, and edited with the same techniques. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e f g h i Galbraith IV, Stuart (2008).
