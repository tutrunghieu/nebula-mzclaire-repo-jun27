It is sometimes known by the alternative title The Last Roll-Call. Camerini was considered to have no sympathies with the Fascist regime of Italy, but he made this propaganda film that endorsed the colonial policies of the Italian government.[1] It was one of a number of African-set films made during the Fascist era including The White Squadron (1936), Sentinels of Bronze (1937) and Luciano Serra, Pilot (1938).[2] The film portrays the rediscovery of his patriotism of an Italian, who eventually dies for his country. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Gundle p.31 | ^ Palumbo p.294 | ^ Ben-Ghiat p.134","m_external_link":"The Great Appeal at the Internet Movie Database | ","m_poster":null,"m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Ercole Patti Pietro Solari Mario Soldati Mario Camerini"}
