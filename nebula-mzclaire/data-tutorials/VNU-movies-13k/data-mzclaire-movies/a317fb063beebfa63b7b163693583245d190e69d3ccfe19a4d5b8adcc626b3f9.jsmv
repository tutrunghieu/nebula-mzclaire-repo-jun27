However, after winning this year, they are left reeling by the departure of Buttermaker as their coach and an injury to goat-turned-hero Timmy Lupus (Quinn Smith). Faced with a chance to play the Houston Toros for a shot at the Japanese champs, they devise a way to get to Houston to play at the famed Astrodome, between games of a Major League Baseball doubleheader. In the process, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley) reunites with his estranged father (William Devane), who is ultimately recruited to coach them. | This film is remembered for the scene in which Coach Leak leads the Astrodome crowd in the chant \"Let them play!\" when the umpires attempt to call the game prematurely because of time constraints. The crowd at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game also used this chant when the announcement came that the game would end in a tie at the end of the inning if neither team scored.[citation needed] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Canby, Vincent (August 20, 1977). \"The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (1977) 'Bad News Bears' Make Comeback In an Effort to Go On to Japan\".
