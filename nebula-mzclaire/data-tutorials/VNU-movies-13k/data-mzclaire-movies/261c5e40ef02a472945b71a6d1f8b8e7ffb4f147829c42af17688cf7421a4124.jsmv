{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set in London on the third or fourth anniversary of a nuclear war which lasted two minutes and twenty-eight seconds, including signing the peace treaty. Three (or possibly four) years after the nuclear holocaust, the survivors wander amidst the debris. Penelope is 17 months pregnant and lives with her lover, Alan, and her parents in a tube train on the (still functioning) Circle Line. | Other survivors include Captain Bules Martin, who holds a \"Defeat of England\" medal, as he was unable to save Buckingham Palace from disintegration during the war. Lord Fortnum (Richardson) is fearful that he will mutate into the \"bed sitting room\" of the title. Mate is a fireguard, except that there is nothing left to burn. Shelter Man is a Regional Seat of Government who survived the war in a fallout shelter and spends his days looking at old films (without a projector) and reminiscing about the time he shot his wife and his mother as they pleaded with him to let them in his shelter. Similarly, the \"National Health Service\" is the name of a male nurse, although overwhelmed by the extent of the war. Finally, there are two policemen (Cook and Moore), who hover overhead in the shell of a Morris Minor Panda car that has been made into a makeshift balloon, and shout \"keep moving\" at any survivors they see to offset the 'danger' of them becoming a 'target' in the unlikely event of another outbreak of hostilities. | Lord Fortnum travels to 29 Cul de Sac Place and actually does become a bed sitting room. Penelope's mother is provided with a death certificate, after which she turns into a wardrobe. Penelope is forced to marry Martin because of his \"bright future\", despite her love for Alan. Her father is initially selected to become Prime Minister due to \"his inseam measurements,\" but unfortunately, he mutates into a parrot and is eaten due to the starvation conditions that prevail. | Penelope finally gives birth, but her monstrous mutant progeny dies. It emerges that Martin is impotent, so he yields marriage consummation to Alan. Penelope has a second child, which is normal, and there is an indication of hope for the future of the country amidst the devastation when it transpires that a team of surgeons have developed a cure for the mutations involving full-body transplant. Finally, a military band pays homage to Mrs. Ethel Shroake of 393A High Street, Leytonstone, the late Queen's former charwoman, and closest in succession to the throne.","m_cast":"Ralph Richardson as Lord Fortnum of Alamein | Rita Tushingham as Penelope | Michael Hordern as Bules Martin | Arthur Lowe as Father | Mona Washbourne as Mother | Peter Cook as Police Inspector | Dudley Moore as Police Sergeant | Spike Milligan as Mate | Harry Secombe as Shelter Man | Marty Feldman as Nurse Arthur | Jimmy Edwards as Nigel | Roy Kinnear as Plastic Mac Man | Ronald Fraser as The Army | Richard Warwick as Alan | Frank Thornton as The BBC | Dandy Nichols as Mrs Ethel Shroake | Jack Shepherd as Underwater Vicar | Henry Woolf as Electricity Man","m_reception":null,"m_production":"After completing Petulia, Richard Lester had intended his next film to be Up Against It, which was written by playwright Joe Orton, but Orton was murdered shortly before production.
