{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After the loss of their eldest son, Caleb, to the war in Afghanistan, the Peterson family (the husband, wife and their children Luke and Anna) are visited by David Collins, who claims to be a former soldier and Caleb's best friend, and he is there to help Caleb take care of the family. David is polite, warm and friendly toward the family, and Mrs. Peterson offers to let him stay as long as he needs to. | David hears of Mr. Peterson's troubles at work and sees Luke return home with a mark on his face, caused by a gang of jock bullies in school. The next day, with Luke's help, David follows the bullying jock gang that attacked Luke to a bar, and humiliates them in a confrontation which erupts into a fight that injures all the bullies. He then uses his knowledge of the law, as well as a bribe, to convince the bartender not to tell anyone. David then goes to a party with a reluctant Anna, at which he saves her friend Kristen from her ex-boyfriend, also inquiring about where to buy guns from Anna's friend Craig. On their way home, Anna offers to make David a mix CD. | David gives Luke some advice on dealing with bullies and gives him his butterfly knife. He meets Craig and his friend to buy the gun, but then kills them both and takes all the weapons, including two grenades. An increasingly suspicious Anna calls the military base to ask about David. The call alerts a private corporation headed by Major Carver, who assembles a special forces team and heads to Anna's house. Anna is told that David died a week ago. Anna then learns that Craig was killed and her boyfriend Zeke has been blamed for it. It is revealed that Mr. Peterson's boss died under mysterious circumstances, giving him the promotion he always wanted. Anna asks Luke to research the numbers David has called on his phone. | At school, one of the bullies assaults Luke again, and he retaliates, injuring the bully. After they are both sent to the principal's office, David arrives and blackmails the principal to give Luke a month of after-school detention with threats of litigation if the principal expels him. Luke tells David of Anna's suspicions, but Promises not to investigate any further or tell anyone else. While David helps Mrs. Peterson with the laundry, Major Carver's team attack the house. David deftly kills all except Carver. Deciding his cover has been blown, David kills Mrs. Peterson. While driving away, he sees Mr. Peterson and kills him as well. | Carver picks up Anna and informs her of her parents' death. He reveals that David is a former test subject for a military program. He was \"programmed\" to kill anyone who might compromise his identity. David kills Kristen, destroys the restaurant she works at, then heads for the school to kill Luke. Carver and Anna head for the school, and enter a haunted house set up for the Halloween dance. David announces his presence by turning off the lights and playing Anna's mix CD, then kills Luke's teacher and Carver. Anna shoots David with Carver's gun, but David stabs her in the leg and attempts to choke her. Luke stabs David with his own butterfly knife. As he seemingly dies, David tells Luke that he's \"proud of him\". | Sitting in an ambulance, Anna and Luke overhear the firefighters talking. They found two charred corpses with no teeth. Anna then sees David exiting the building, posing as a firefighter.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Wingard directed the new thriller film with the script written by Simon Barrett. Keith Calder and Jessica Wu produced.[5] On March 7, 2014 Picturehouse picked up the US distribution rights to the film.[6] The film was released into cinemas on September 5, 2014.[7] | Casting choices focused on character actors.[8] On June 11, 2013, actor Dan Stevens signed to star in the role of David. [5] Maika Monroe was signed on June 26, to star opposite Stevens as Anna. [9] On July 8, two more were added to the cast, Brendan Meyer, who played Luke, Monroe's character's younger brother, and Lance Reddick, who played a CID agent.[10] When casting Stevens, Barrett and Wingard were aware that he would initially be quite likable, both for his attractiveness and his character's importance to the plot. However, they said the title made the story obvious, and though audiences may cheer on his character for his entertainment value, he is clearly the antagonist of the film, something audiences will easily recognize.[11] | On July 17, 2013, The New Mexico Film Office announced the start of the production of The Guest.[12] The filming finished at the end of August and was filmed in different locations such as Moriarty, Edgewood and Estancia.[13] | According to director Adam Wingard, the original rough cut of The Guest was over twenty minutes longer than the final theatrical cut. After this version was screened to a test audience, it was cut down to the running time very close to the runtime of the theatrical cut. After another test screening, the audience was confused at the sudden arrival of Major Richard Carver and his team at the Peterson home, which is why some scenes with Carver at KPG headquarters were added in final cut of the film.[14][15] | Some of the scenes which were cut down or deleted completely after test screenings were scenes which explained what exactly \"David\" is, what happened to him, why he does some of the things he does in the film, and more details and information about the KPG program that he was involved in. These scenes were cut because the test audience felt that all of it was just too much information. Even Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett admitted that they hated explaining David's character and his background because they always wanted to leave much of the information about him ambiguous, which is why they were glad that those scenes were disliked by the test screening audience and had to be cut out of the film.[16]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Adam Wingard","m_produced_by":"Jessica Calder | Keith Calder","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dan Stevens | Maika Monroe | Leland Orser | Sheila Kelley | Brendan Meyer | Lance Reddick","m_music_by":"Steve Moore","m_cinematography":"Robby Baumgartner","m_edited_by":"Adam Wingard","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Picturehouse","m_release_dates":"January 17, 2014 (2014-01-17) (Sundance) | September 17, 2014 (2014-09-17) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$2.4 million[2] | The Guest is a 2014 American action thriller film directed and edited by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett.
