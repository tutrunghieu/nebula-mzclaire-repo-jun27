{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Doctor Dré and Ed Lover are two bumbling barbers at a Harlem barbershop. Knowing full well that cutting hair is not their calling, their boss, friend, and mentor Nick (Jim Moody) tells the two maybe they should try out for the police academy. Crazily enough, it works out for the two, and they are accepted on the New York City police force. Things seem to be going well for them, when tragedy suddenly strikes, and they lose Nick. Now enforcers of the law, the tag team decides to investigate the incident, which they believe to be a murder. | Ed and Dre find out through the streets that a crooked land developer named Demetrius (Richard Bright) might have had something to do with their friend's death, and proceed to attempt to dig up as much dirt on him as possible. This proves to be difficult, however, when they've got a nutty Sergeant (Denis Leary), a moody detective (Rozwill Young), and a bunch of unwilling street hoods (Guru, Ice-T) to go through to get the information they need. Though there aren't any certain clues to be found, strange happenings are certainly going on, as Demetrius' company seems to be digging for something rather than looking to build on all the property he's buying up in their Harlem neighborhood, and the bodies slowly continue to pile up around them.","m_cast":"Doctor Dré as Himself | Ed Lover as Himself | Badja Djola as Lionel Douglas | Cheryl \"Salt\" James as Teesha Braxton | Colin Quinn as Frankie Flynn | Denis Leary as Sergeant Cooper | Bernie Mac as G-George | Richard Gant as Albert | Guru as Martin Lorenzo | Ice-T as Chauncey \"Nighttrain\" Jackson | Larry Cedar as Officer Barnes | Jim Moody as Nick Crawford | Joe Lisi as Captain Reilly | Karen Duffy as Officer Day | House of Pain as Bad Guys | Roger Robinson as Charlie | Richard Bright as Demetrius | Rozwill Young as Bo Griles | Vinny Pastore as Tony \"Clams\" Como | Caron Bernstein as Kelly | Angelo Montagnese as The Manno | Michael Giordano as Not the Manno Dano | Kim Chan as Fuji | Cameo appearances: | B-Real as Jose/Test Taker #3 | Andre B.
