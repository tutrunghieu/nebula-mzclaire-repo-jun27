{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Mummy's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey (Toolsie Persaud). The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem (Dickie Owen), a manservant of Kah-To-Bey, spirited away the boy when his father (Bruno Barnabe) was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection. Unfortunately, the boy dies and is buried. | The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden (Andre Morell), (a Hammer regular) and business man Stanley Preston (John Phillips) finding the tomb. They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid (Roger Delgado), a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud. Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb. He recovers, but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo. | Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum, to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince's mummy himself. Meanwhile, after being placed in the Cairo Museum, the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud. The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition, beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum. One by one, those who assisted in removing the contents of the tomb to Cairo are eliminated by such grisly means as strangulation, being thrown out of windows, and having photographic acid thrown in their face. Greedy Stanley Preston, the real villain of the piece, after repeated attempts to evade the murder investigations and flee for his own safely, is murdered in a Cairo sidestreet by the avenging mummy. All ends happily thanks to the intervention of remaining members of the party, Stanley's son Paul Preston (David Buck) and Maggie Claire de Sangre (Maggie Kimberly), who succeed in destroying the Mummy in a very dramatic and beautifully staged finale.","m_cast":"André Morell as Sir Basil Walden (as Andre Morell) | John Phillips as Stanley Preston | David Buck as Paul Preston | Elizabeth Sellars as Barbara Preston | Maggie Kimberly as Claire (as Maggie Kimberley) | Michael Ripper as Longbarrow | Tim Barrett as Harry | Richard Warner as Inspector Barrani | Roger Delgado as Hasmid | Catherine Lacey as Haiti | Dickie Owen as Prem | Bruno Barnabe as Pharaoh | Toni Gilpin as Pharaoh's Wife | Toolsie Persaud as Kah-to-Bey | Eddie Powell as The Mummy","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Gilling","m_produced_by":"Michael Carreras","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"André Morell John Phillips David Buck Maggie Kimberly Elizabeth Sellars","m_music_by":"Don Banks","m_cinematography":"Arthur Grant","m_edited_by":"Chris Barnes","m_production_company":"Hammer Film Productions","m_distributed_by":"Warner-Pathé (UK) 20th Century Fox (US)","m_release_dates":"15 March 1967 (1967-03-15) (U.S.) | 18 June 1967 (1967-06-18) (UK) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"90 min","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Mummy's Shroud is a 1967 British DeLuxe colour horror film made by Hammer Film Productions which was directed by John Gilling. | It stars André Morell and David Buck as explorers who uncover the tomb of an ancient Egyptian mummy.
