{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Playboy business tycoon Liu Xuan (刘轩, played by Deng Chao) purchases the Green Gulf, a wildlife reserve, for a sea reclamation project, and uses sonar technology to get rid of the sea life in the area. Unknown to him, the Green Gulf is the home of merpeople, and the sonar has caused many of them to die or get sick. The few survivors live in an abandoned shipwreck in the gulf, and want to assassinate Xuan for his deeds. The merfolk send Shan (珊, played by Lin Yun), a beautiful mermaid who is trained to walk on her fins and hide among humans, in a \"honeytrap\" plot against Xuan. On the night of Xuan's party celebrating his success, Shan, pretending to be a dancer, gives her telephone number to Xuan. | Xuan, believing that Shan is a prostitute, calls her number in order to make his business partner jealous. Shan goes to Xuan and tries to kill him but her attempts keep backfiring. In the end, Xuan decides to send Shan back home, and along the way Shan takes him to a funfair that she works at. While there, Shan tries to show Xuan there are more important things than money, and Xuan is impressed with Shan's simple, funny antics. They spend the day together and develop feelings for each other. When Xuan finally takes Shan home, Shan quickly sends Xuan away before her people can kill him. The next day, Xuan takes Shan for another date and proposes, but Shan rejects him. | That night, Xuan goes to Shan's house to talk to her, and discovers the truth that she and her family are merpeople. Against Shan's wishes, the others capture Xuan and tell him how he's killing them with his development project. Xuan is about to be killed when Shan helps him escape. Xuan returns home and, after the shock has worn off, decides to investigate the effects of his project. He turns off the sonar but mistakenly tells his business partner that Shan is a mermaid and where the other merpeople live. The merpeople are attacked, and many of them are killed. Xuan arrives in time to save Shan before she's killed, and sends her back into the ocean so she can escape. | Three years later, a student arrives at Xuan's home to thank him for setting up a scholarship for research into environmental protection. The student asks Xuan whether merpeople are real and the story that he fell in love with a mermaid is true, but Xuan denies it. Xuan then introduces the student to his wife \"Lucy\", who is actually Shan.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Buoyed by anticipation from fans as well as having the advantage of opening a day after the Chinese New Year, The Mermaid recorded an opening day record of US$40.9 million, which is the biggest opening day for a Chinese film (breaking Lost In Hong Kong's record) and the second biggest of all time there only behind the opening day of Furious 7.[35][36] US$1 million came from midnight screenings.[37] It set a new record for the fastest film to earn CN¥1 billion (US$152.4 million), doing so in just 4 days of release,[38][39] and also recorded the largest 5-days gross (US$187.3 million).[40] Through its seven-day opening week, it grossed a total of $275.1 million, breaking records for the biggest seven day gross and the biggest-opening week of all time in China (breaking Furious 7's record),[41] and the third biggest of all time, behind Hollywood films Star Wars: The Force Awakens (US$390.8 million) and Jurassic World (US$296.2 million).[42] It grossed US$120.4 million alone for the three-day opening weekend (Friday to Sunday), which is the biggest of all time in China and the second biggest three-day gross behind Furious 7's Saturday to Monday gross.[43] This along with From Vegas to Macau III (US$119 million) and The Monkey King 2 (US$116 million) helped Chinese box office break the Guinness World Record for the biggest box office week with $548 million from February 8 – 14, 2016.[41] The previous record was set during the week of December 26, 2015 – January 1, 2016 when Star Wars: The Force Awakens led the box office with US$261 million and the box office that week totalled US$529.6 million.[41] And the previous biggest Chinese box office week was set in July 2015 when Monster Hunt, Pancake Man, and Monkey King: Hero is Back, combined for a then total US$253 million during their first week.[44] On February 19 – 12 days after release – the film became the highest-grossing film in China with CN¥2.45 billion, overtaking the previous record holder, Monster Hunt.[45][46][47] In its second weekend, it fell precipitously by 53% to US$55.9 million from 155,704 screenings for a 14-day total of US$419.2 million.[48] On February 26, it was announced that The Mermaid has grossed 3 billion yuan (US$459 million) on its 19th day since release on Chinese mainland. It is the first film ever to launch the 3-billion-yuan club in China's film industry and set a new milestone.[49] On March 5, it became the first film to gross over US$500 million in China[50] and the seventh overall in a single territory.[51] To date, The Mermaid has grossed 3.39 billion yuan (US$525 million) in China,[52] and due to its success, its theatrical release in China has also been extended to June 2016.[53] | The film also found success outside of the Middle Kingdom where it scored the biggest opening day of all time for a Chinese film in Malaysia ($838,000) and Singapore ($528,000).[47] It also opened at No. 1 in Malaysia with US$3.8 million (ahead of Deadpool) and in Vietnam with US$2 million. In Singapore, it debuted at No. 2 with US$1.6 million.[54] In Hong Kong, The Mermaid broke the local opening day record with HK$4.96 million (US$638,352), surpassing the previous record holder Kung Fu Hustle (HK$4.42 million) which was also directed by Chow.[55][56] As of April 3, it has grossed a total of US$7.69 million there.[57] | It was released by Sony Pictures in a limited release in the United States on February 19 across 35 theaters.[58] It grossed $985 thousands on its opening weekend – at an average of $28,144 per theater – making it the biggest opening weekend for a limited release Chinese-language film.[59] | However, Apple Daily reported that Taiwan won't be releasing The Mermaid.[60][61] Taiwanese quota regulations permit only ten Chinese mainland films to be released in Taiwan every year.[62][63] The mainland movies must draw lots and only those with numbers 1–10 get permission—The Mermaid drew #44. This was the first time that Taiwan audiences missed a Stephen Chow's film, and there were protests from fans against Taiwan's cultural ministry.[64] | Response to the film has been generally positive. It has a 92% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Mermaid requires a willingness to embrace the strange, but backs up its wacky flights of fancy with a big-hearted fairy tale and a resonant message.\"[65] | Glenn Kenny of The New York Times says The Mermaid is \"no ordinary fantastical rom-com…encompassing as it does weaponized sea urchins, incredibly delicious roasted chickens, man-octopus self-mutilation and other comic oddities.\"[66] Bilge Ebiri of New York Magazine praises the film as it's \"amazing how distinctive and strange Mermaid manages to be, especially given the highly derivative concept - how personal it feels, amid all the absurdist, go-for-broke humor. It deserves to be seen.\"[67] Dylan Kickham of Entertainment Weekly thinks the film is \"at its best when it embraces the ridiculous, no-holds-barred, farcical comedy that Chow has become known for, thanks to films like Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer. From the start, and throughout the middle of the movie, Chow and his actors present a full-force farce.\"[68] Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com says \"It doesn't matter if you don't like subtitles. It doesn't matter if you've never heard of the director. It doesn't matter if you've never seen a Chinese movie in your life. It will make you laugh. Guaranteed.\"[69] South China Morning Post's film critic Ben Sin gave the film three out of five stars and describes it as \"a solid dramedy with heart and, more importantly, a message\", though he opines that this being the second film from Chow where he remains behind the camera, it \"has to be disappointing to Hongkongers\".[9] James Marsh of Screen International says actress Lin \"brings a delightfully quirky demeanour to her literal fish out of water\" and \"the occasionally hokey CGI only adds to the film’s oddball charm.\"[3] Zhang Rui of China.org.cn says \"The film has a simple and strong message to deliver: Love can transcend race and other barriers. You could hardly expect to see such a pure fairy tale and such a clean theme in blockbusters for a long time, but Chow has done it with a pure and childlike heart.\"[70] Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter says \"the fantastical Mermaid delivers its message without a shred of subtlety (and is unapologetic about it) but with considerable charm, wit and darkness to make up for it.\"[1] Wei Xi of Global Times is more critical, and calls it lacklustre in comparison with Chow's previous Journey to the West.[71] MovieXclusive.com gave the film four out of five stars and says the film \"is a complete package – a stellar cast which delivers fun performances, a decent story about environmentalism, and most importantly: a barrelful of laughs guaranteed to entertain the whole family.\"[72]","m_production":"The Mermaid was filmed from October 2014 to February 2015 in three locations in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Dongguan, and then later in Beijing with the budget of US$60.72 million. Before the filming, confirmed cast members include Deng Chao, Show Luo, Zhang Yuqi, and newcomer Lin Yun was from a talent contest held specifically for The Mermaid in Shenzhen.[13] | Stephen Chow picked Deng Chao to play the film's lead male character Liu Xuan, even though Show Luo (who played Octopus in the film, and had previously worked with Chow in Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons) was also in the consideration. Chow explained that he ultimately chose Deng Chao for the lead role due to his overwhelming popularity in China, and he also had confidence in Deng's comedic talent, having observed his performances in the slapstick-style hit The Breakup Guru.[13] | Zhang Yuqi first worked with Chow in CJ7 and gained fame from that role. They both later fell out in a highly publicized contractual dispute.[13] But the personal relationship between them were not intense and Zhang once defended Chow when he was under personality attacks from former disgruntled collaborators and employees. When Zhang got a call from Chow she was in a foreign country while her car broke down. She said yes to join the cast to play the film's villain, and described the role as a personal challenge. | The selection of the female lead character, the \"Mermaid\" Shan, was one of the most publicized parts of the filming process. As reported on Oriental Daily News, the then 18-year-old actress Lin Yun was selected by Chow and his casting team from over 120,000 participants due to her demure personality in a talent contest held in Shenzhen. Reportedly, throughout the 13 casting-training period, Lin Yun caught the casting team's eyes for being calm and collected while other participants tried their hardest to steal the spotlight. According to Lin Yun, she entered the audition at her friends' recommendation, and has always admired Stephen Chow.[14] | The mass audition was from July 31 - August 15, 2014 when everyone can submit the CVs to the website for online votes and for the casting team to choose. A total of 43 contestants were selected after the first round, and then would be shortlisted to 13 finalists to participate in the final contest held on September 15, 2014.[15] Among them, six were chosen to continue in the audition process.[16] Lin Yun eventually won the role of the film. | The story was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale of \"The Little Mermaid\" in which a mermaid loves a human, but Chow wanted to make it a modern interpretation: \"I saw great creative space and development potential from the story\".[17][18] In another interview, Chow said: \"I'm actually a big fairy-tale addict. All my previous titles can be understood as fairy tales. In the world of fairy tales, the evil are punished and the good see a happy ending. I buy the idea.\" [19] | Another inspiration comes from Chow's own childhood experience. \"I lived by sea at my young age and I looked at the sea everyday, thinking what are in there? I was frightened and curious. I was very nervous when I swam in the sea anytime and felt there would be something hid underneath. I was fascinated with the (mermaid) story since then, and I felt I could do the film 6 years ago and started writing the script four or five years ago.\"[20] | The Mermaid filming and production was in well-kept secret. A major set was built up in a big empty factory, which was once for glass production, in Shenzhen as the shelter of mermaids in the film.[21] Reports say that most of the scenes in his latest film have been shot more than 50 times to meet his exacting standards. Chow has even personally coached most of the cast on acting-from lead stars Deng, Zhang Yuqi and Lin Yun to Show Luo,[19] as well as other cast members. To get the best result, Chow once let Deng Chao and Lin Yun eat 150 roasted chickens for shooting a scene.[20] Lin Yun said Chow has never shouted at her and would often watch out for her. Playing the role of a mermaid, Lin often had to put on the safety harness when filming her underwater scenes. As she was not used to it, she often incurred injuries all over her body, and on one occasion, Yun nearly became disfigured.[22] | The film wrapped up filming in Beijing on February 2, 2015,[21] and then went into post-production, adding visual effects by Ken Law and his Different Digital Design Ltd., as well as by MACROGRAPH，Ltd. from South Korea, both of which worked for Chow's previous film Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons.[23][24] | Before their collaboration on the upcoming film Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons 2, directors Tsui Hark and Stephen Chow worked together for the first time in The Mermaid. At a press conference in Beijing to promote The Mermaid, it was revealed that director Tsui Hark and actor Kris Wu will have cameo appearances in the film. The two film directors have never worked together during their careers each spanning three decades. Tsui Hark said they have discussed collaboration for years but Chow was so busy that Tsui had to wait until now.[25][26] | Other notable cameos include actor Wen Zhang, who was in Chow's previous blockbuster Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons, and the comedian duo Kong Lianshun and Bai Ke (White. K) from the popular web series Surprise, which was adapted into the 2015 fantasy comedy film Surprise directed by Show Joy.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stephen Chow","m_produced_by":"Stephen Chow Y.Y.
