{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In early 19th century Styria, a beautiful blonde (Kirsten Lindholm) in a diaphanous gown materializes from a misty graveyard. Encountering the Baron Hartog (Douglas Wilmer), a vampire hunter out to avenge the death of his sister, the girl is identified as a vampire and decapitated. Many years later, a dark-haired lady leaves her daughter Marcilla (Ingrid Pitt) in the care of General von Spielsdorf (Peter Cushing) and his family in Styria. Marcilla quickly befriends the General's niece, Laura (Pippa Steel). Laura subsequently suffers nightmares that she is being attacked, and dies of a gradual sickness; whereupon Marcilla departs. | Faking a carriage break-down, Marcilla's mother leaves her (now using the alias 'Carmilla') at the residence of a Mr. Morton, where Carmilla befriends and seduces Morton's daughter Emma (Madeline Smith). Thereafter Emma suffers nightmares of penetration over the heart, and her breast shows tiny wounds. Emma's governess, Madame Perrodot (Kate O'Mara), becomes Carmilla's accomplice. The butler and a doctor suspect them; but Carmilla kills each one. A mysterious man in black watches events from a distance, smiling (his presence is never explained). Having killed the butler, Carmilla takes Emma prisoner and departs. When Madame Perrodot begs Carmilla to take her too, Carmilla kills her. Emma is rescued by a young man named Carl (Jon Finch), and Carmilla flees to her ancestral castle, now a ruin. All this coincides with the arrival of the General, who brings a now-aged Baron Hartog. They find Carmilla's grave, which reveals that her true name is Mircalla Karnstien, where the General forces a stake into Carmilla's heart, and cuts off her head. Thereupon Carmilla's portrait on the wall shows a fanged skeleton instead of a beautiful young woman.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Before production, the script of The Vampire Lovers was sent to the chief censor John Trevelyan, who warned the studio about depictions of lesbianism, pointing out that a previous lesbian film, The Killing of Sister George, had had five minutes excised by his office. In response, Hammer replied that the lesbianism was not of their doing but was present in the original story by Le Fanu. Trevelyan backed down.[2] Production of The Vampire Lovers began at Elstree Studios on 19 January 1970 and used locations in the grounds of Moor Park Mansion, Hertfordshire (standing in for Styria, Central Europe). Produced on a relatively low budget of £165,227,[3] it was the final Hammer film to be financed with American money—most of the later films were backed by Rank or EMI.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu","m_directed_by":"Roy Ward Baker","m_produced_by":"Michael Style Harry Fine","m_screenplay_by":"Tudor Gates","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ingrid Pitt George Cole Kate O'Mara Peter Cushing Ferdy Mayne Douglas Wilmer Madeline Smith Dawn Addams Jon Finch Pippa Steel Kirsten Lindholm Janet Key Harvey Hall John Forbes-Robertson Charles Farrell Shelagh Wilcocks","m_music_by":"Harry Robertson","m_cinematography":"Moray Grant","m_edited_by":"James Needs","m_production_company":"American International Pictures Hammer Film Productions Fantale Films (uncredited)","m_distributed_by":"American International Pictures (USA, theatrical) Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (2003, DVD)","m_release_dates":"4 October 1970","m_running_time":"91 min.","m_country":"United Kingdom United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£165,227[1] | The Vampire Lovers is a 1970 British gothic horror film directed by Roy Ward Baker and starring Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt, Madeline Smith, Kate O'Mara and Jon Finch.
