{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Paris during the German occupation, an ill-assorted group of resistance fighters commits disorganized attacks. Missak Manouchian, an Armenian exile, is ready to help but is reluctant to kill; for him, being ready to die but not to kill is an ethical matter. However, circumstances lead him to abandon his reluctance. Under his leadership, the group structures and plans its actions and thus the Manouchian network is born. The film traces the story of this group, from its shaping to the arrest and execution of its members in 1944.","m_cast":"Virginie Ledoyen as Mélinée Manouchian | Simon Abkarian as Missak Manouchian | Robinson Stévenin as Marcel Rayman | Jean-Pierre Darroussin as Inspecteur Pujol | Lola Naymark as Monique | Ariane Ascaride as Madame Elek | Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet as Thomas Elek | Yann Trégouët as Le Commissaire David | Ivan Franek as Feri Boczov | Olga Legrand as Olga Bancic | Boris Bergman as Monsieur Rayman | Patrick Bonnel as Monsieur Elek | Adrien Jolivet as Henri Krasucki | Gérard Meylan as Inspecteur Mathelin | Horaţiu Mălăele as Monsieur Dupont | Lucas Belvaux as Gilles","m_reception":"Opening in 250 screens, The Army of Crime debuted at number 7 at the French box office, making it the second highest grossing new release of that week following District 9, which debuted at the number one spot with almost twice as many screens.[3] The film grossed over 772,000 Euros in its first five days of release and attracted 349,940 viewers to French theatres.[4] | It was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2009.[5] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 90% based on 30 reviews and an average rating of 6.8/10.[6] At Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[7] | The film received largely positive reviews from French critics, with the website AlloCiné awarding it a score of 3.52 out of 5.00 based on twenty-five major reviews.[8] Positif's Jean A.
