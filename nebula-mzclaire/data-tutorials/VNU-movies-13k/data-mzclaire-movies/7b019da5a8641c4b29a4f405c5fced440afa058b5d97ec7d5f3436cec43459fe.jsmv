Keeping with family tradition, he decides to host a regular family reunion cookout in his new place, however, not planning for it to clash with an important business meeting for an endorsement deal. | Meanwhile, Bling Bling (played by Ja Rule) is jealous that Todd has made it with his basketball contract after being insulted and embarrassed in front of the neighborhood when Todd did not recognize who he was. He plans to get many pairs of sneakers signed by the upcoming star to sell on eBay and become rich. Whilst on his way to Todd's new house, he crashes his car due to his clumsy friend and then tries to steal a new Mercedes from a car park without realizing the car belongs to Todd's girlfriend Brittany. After finding out he holds her at gunpoint and forces her to drive him there. | Although the meeting is scheduled to take place in the morning, and the guests are to arrive in the afternoon, one by one members of Todd's eccentric family begin to arrive before expected disrupting his business interview. The neighbors are drawn to the cookout, and Todd is concerned mainly about his image, as his family's antics are making a poor impression on his neighbors. | When Bling Bling and his criminal sidekick invade the cookout so they can get Todd's autograph, the ensuing chaos makes Todd realize how much he needs his family. He realizes that he loves the family for the way they are and gets a shock by the endorsement interviewer. Todd breaks up with Brittney and marries Becky and scored 26 points in his debut in New Jersey.","m_cast":"Quran Pender — Todd Andersen (credited as Storm P.) | Jenifer Lewis — Lady Em/Emma Andersen | Meagan Good — Brittany | Ja Rule — Bling Bling/Percival \"Assmackey\" Ashmokeem | Jonathan Silverman — Wes Riley | Tim Meadows — Leroy | Farrah Fawcett — Mrs. Crowley | Ruperto Vanderpool — Wheezer | Frankie Faison — JoJo Andersen | Vincent Pastore — Horse shit salesman (credited as \"Poo Salesman\") | Eve — Becky | Danny Glover — Judge Crowley | Queen Latifah — Security Guard | Roberto Roman — Danny | Reg E.
