It is an adaptation of the poem of the same name by Aleksandr Pushkin. There are few words in the film besides those of the poem itself, which is read from beginning to end by the narrator and the voice actors. Some portions of the poem are skipped. | Here is how the director Yuriy Norsteyn spoke of Ivan Ivanov-Vano, mentioning this animated film:\" Ivan Ivanov-Vano the first used motives and methods of folk art in animation. Study in Vkhutemas, education in traditions of the Russian vanguard, excellent knowledge of world art culture — all this affected in his creativity. From the point of view of art criticism mechanics, it would be possible to call him the formalist, he wasn't afraid to experiment. \"The Humpbacked Horse\" which became classics was such director's experiment. In it Ivanov-Vano connected everything: love to the Russian culture, poetry, knowledge of a profession, good possession of all arsenal of animation of that time. It turned Disney's technology into powerful action — the Russian movie. Here I was, of course, and a merit of the artist, Lev Milchin whom he didn't leave all life. \"The Tale Tsar Saltan\" became their latest work. It was the ideal tandem — irrepressible nature, the person soldier, the fanatic, the tyrant Vano and the intellectual to the core who wasn't affording anything superfluous, but everything Milchin, understanding, sharp to grotesque. For several decades its elements, its native habitat was the Russian fairy tale.\" |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The film at the Animator.ru (English and Russian) | Skazka o tsare Saltane at the Internet Movie Database | The film at myltik.ru (Russian)","m_poster":null,"m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Aleksandr Pushkin (libretto) Lev Milchin Ivan Ivanov-Vano"}
