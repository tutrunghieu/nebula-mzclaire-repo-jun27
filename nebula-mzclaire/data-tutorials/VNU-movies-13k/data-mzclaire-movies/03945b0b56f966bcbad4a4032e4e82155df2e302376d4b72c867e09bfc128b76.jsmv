{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the Vatican City, Vicar Imani (Djimon Hounsou) shows Cardinal Bruun (Peter Andersson) the case of Angela Holmes (Olivia Taylor Dudley), a young American woman who is suspected of harboring an evil spirit. | Three months ago in the United States, Angela is given a surprise birthday party by her father, Roger (Dougray Scott), and boyfriend, Peter \"Pete\" Smith (John Patrick Amedori). While slicing her cake, she cuts herself and is rushed to the hospital, where she briefly meets with Father Lozano (Michael Peña). She is injected with a serum that causes an infection; at home, she experiences a seizure and is placed under care at a hospital. A few days later, Angela is released, but on the way, she violently takes the wheel, causeing an accident that puts her in a coma for 40 days. Just as her life support is about to be switched off, Angela comes round, seemingly in perfect health. | However, Angela begins to show a case of demonic possession when she almost drowns a baby, followed by forcing a detective (Jarvis W. George) to commit suicide. Lozano chooses to send her to a psychiatric hospital. A distraught Roger then confesses that Angela's mother was a prostitute; she was pregnant just a few months after Roger met her before she abruptly left, implying that Roger merely adopted Angela. Angela's possession becomes even worse as she frequently sleepwalks, taunts her psychiatrist, Dr. Richards (Kathleen Robertson), eventually culminating in her speaking in Aramaic that induces hysteria and mass suicide in her fellow patients. Deciding that nothing can save her, the hospital releases her. | The movie transitions to the timeline of the prologue. Bruun concludes that Angela is possessed by the Antichrist due to the presence of the crows around her, which are agents of Satan, and instructs Imani to stay back while he personally heads to the United States to cure Angela. An exorcism he plans involves an Eucharist where Angela spits three eggs meant to symbolize an inverted Trinity. Bruun realizes that the Antichrist is already a part of Angela; killing him would mean Angela's death as well. However, just after Bruun kills Angela, she rises up as the resurrected Antichrist, mirroring the Resurrection of Jesus, and proceeds to kill Bruun, Roger, and Pete. She spares Lozano, though, and tells him to inform the Vatican that the Antichrist is roaming the Earth. | Five months later, Lozano, having been released from the hospital, visits the Vatican and is allowed access to the archives by Imani. He is shown footage of what has happened since: Angela returns to life as the only \"survivor\" of the exorcism besides Lozano and is now using her miracles to gather followers. The film ends with Angela entering a room to greet her followers while outstretching her arms.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Principal photography began in July 2013 in Los Angeles.[6][7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mark Neveldine","m_produced_by":"Chris Cowles | Gary Lucchesi | Chris Morgan | Tom Rosenberg","m_screenplay_by":"Christopher Borrelli","m_story_by":"Christopher Borrelli | Chris Morgan","m_starring":"Olivia Taylor Dudley | Kathleen Robertson | Michael Peña | Djimon Hounsou | Dougray Scott | John Patrick Amedori","m_music_by":"Joseph Bishara[1]","m_cinematography":"Gerardo Mateo Madrazo","m_edited_by":"Eric Potter","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Lionsgate | Pantelion Films","m_release_dates":"July 24, 2015 (2015-07-24) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"91 minutes[2]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | Aramaic","m_budget":"$13 million[3]","m_box_office":"$13.5 million[4] | The Vatican Tapes is a 2015 American supernatural horror film directed by Mark Neveldine from a screenplay written by Christopher Borrelli, which is in turn based on a story by Chris Morgan and Christopher Borrelli. | The film stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Kathleen Robertson, Michael Peña, Djimon Hounsou, Dougray Scott, and John Patrick Amedori, and was released on July 24, 2015, by Lionsgate. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Joseph Bishara Scoring The Vatican Tapes\".
