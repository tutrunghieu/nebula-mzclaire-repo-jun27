{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2005, eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry discovers that the U.S. housing market is extremely unstable, being based on high risk subprime loans. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007 (as rates go up on many adjustable-rate mortgages), he realizes that he can profit from this situation by creating a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against the mortgage backed securities that are based on the housing market. He visits several major investment and commercial banks with this idea – these firms, believing that the housing market is secure, accept his proposal. Burry's huge, long-term bet earns the ire of his clients, who believe that he is wasting their money and demand that he stop his activities – he refuses. As the predicted time of the collapse approaches but Burry's bet doesn't succeed (because the banks refuse to revalue his swaps until they can dump their deteriorating CDO assets then buy swaps on them), his investors lose their confidence and consider pulling out their money – but Burry halts withdrawals from the fund (since its strategy is delayed by a fraudulent market), much to his investors' anger. Eventually, as the housing market collapses further just as he predicted, the value of his fund finally increases 489%. | Trader Jared Vennett is one of the first to understand Burry's analysis, learning about Burry's actions from one of the bankers that sold Burry an early credit default swap. Vennett uses his quant to verify that Burry's predictions are likely true and decides to put his own stake in the credit default swap market, earning a fee on selling the swaps to firms who understand that they will be profitable when the underlying mortgage bonds fail. A misplaced phone call alerts hedge fund manager Mark Baum to his plans, and Baum is convinced to buy credit default swaps from Vennett due to his own personal distaste with the big banks. Vennett explains that the impending market collapse is being further perpetuated by the packaging of poor, unsellable loans into CDOs large enough to be considered diversified and thus given AAA ratings. Baum sends some of his staff to investigate the housing market in Miami, and they discover that mortgage brokers make more money if they only sell risky mortgages to the Wall Street banks – and these mortgages are so easy to acquire that a speculative housing bubble has been created. In early 2007, the mortgages loans begin to default, but the prices of the corresponding bonds increase and their ratings remain the same. When Baum questions an acquaintance at Standard & Poor's, he discovers there is conflict of interest and dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies. When Baum's employees question Vennett's motives, Vennett maintains his position and invites Baum and his team to the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas, where Baum interviews CDO manager Wing Chau, who creates CDOs on behalf of an investment bank while claiming to represent the interests of investors. Chau describes how synthetic CDOs make a chain of increasingly large bets on the faulty loans, involving 20 times as much money as the loans themselves. Baum realizes, much to his horror, that the scale of the fraud will cause a complete collapse of the global economy. Baum convinces his business partners to go through with more credit default swaps, profiting from the situation at the banks' expense. Baum laments that the banks will not accept any of the blame for the crisis. | Eager young investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley accidentally discover a prospectus by Vennett, which convinces them to become involved in the credit default swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Since they are below the capital threshold for an ISDA Master Agreement needed to pull off the trades necessary to profit from the situation, they enlist the aid of retired securities trader Ben Rickert. When the value of their swaps remain the same despite the rise in defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud and thinks they should buy more swaps. The three visit the Mortgage Securities Forum in Las Vegas, where they learn that the Securities Exchange Commission has no regulations to monitor the activity of mortgage-backed securities. They manage to successfully make an even higher-payout deal than the other hedge funds by shorting the higher rated mortgage securities, as they will become worthless if defaults rise above 8% and their real value is likely less than stated. Shipley and Geller are initially ecstatic, but Rickert is disgusted, since they're essentially celebrating an impending economic collapse and soon-to-be-lost lives (40,000 for each 1% rise in the unemployment rate). The two are horrified, and take a much more emotional stake in the collapse by trying to tip off the press and their families about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud amongst the big banks. Ultimately, they profit immensely, but are left with their faith in the system broken. | A note is given that CDOs have come back into the current market, under a different name: \"bespoke tranche opportunity\".","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"As of March 25, 2016[update], The Big Short has grossed $70.1 million in North America and $61.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $131.2 million, against a budget of $28 million.[3] | The film was released in eight theaters in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago on December 11, 2015 and earned $705,527 (an average of $88,191 per theater).

In its opening weekend it grossed $10.5 million, finishing 6th at the box office.[28] | The Big Short has received acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 88%, based on 266 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads, \"The Big Short approaches a serious, complicated subject with an impressive attention to detail – and manages to deliver a well-acted, scathingly funny indictment of its real-life villains in the bargain.\"[29] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[30] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.[28] | IGN gave the film a score of 8.6/10, praising its \"energetic direction\" and making \"a complicated tale palpable for the layperson even as it triggers outrage at the fatcats who helped cause it.\"[31] The New York Times's \"UpShot\" series stated The Big Short offered the \"strongest film explanation of the global financial crisis\".[32] Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders endorsed The Big Short as an \"excellent film\".[33][34]","m_production":"In 2013, Paramount acquired the rights to the 2010 non-fiction book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis, to develop it into a film, which Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment would produce.[15] On March 24, 2014, Adam McKay was hired to write and direct a film about the housing and economic bubble.[4] Screenwriter Charles Randolph, who co-wrote the film with McKay, said one of the first challenges was finding the right tone for the film. He told Creative Screenwriting, \"In general it was trying to find the right tone that was slightly funnier than your average Milos Forman comedy, which is all grounded character-based but not so satirical where you got Wag the Dog. Somewhere between there was what I was shooting for. Once I got the tone down, then I went through the plot. The market’s movements provided you with an underlying plot. You make your short deal, then the bank is trying to squeeze you out, and then it all breaks loose. So that was pretty easy, and it provided character arcs against that.\"[16] Two years after Randolph wrote his draft, McKay, as director, rewrote Randolph's screenplay. It was McKay's idea to include the celebrity cameos in the film to explain the financial concepts.[16] | On January 13, 2015, Variety reported that Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, and Ryan Gosling were set to star in the film, with Pitt producing the film along with Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner.
