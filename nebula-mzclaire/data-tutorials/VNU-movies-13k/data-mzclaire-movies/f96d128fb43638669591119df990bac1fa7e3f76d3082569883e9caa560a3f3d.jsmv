{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"\"Egypt in the year 1900\". A mummy is discovered by three Egyptologists: Englishmen John Bray (Ronald Howard) and Sir Giles Dalrymple (Jack Gwillim) as well as French Professor Eugene Dubois (unbilled Bernard Rebel, who died three weeks before the film's UK premiere). Assisting in the expedition is Professor Dubois' daughter, and Bray's fiancée, Annette (Jeanne Roland), herself an Egyptology expert. All the artifacts are brought back to London by the project's backer, American showman Alexander King (Fred Clark), who plans to recoup his investment by staging luridly sensational public exhibits of the Egyptian treasures. Soon after arrival, however, the mummy revives and starts to kill various members of the expedition, while it becomes evident that sinister Adam Beauchamp (Beecham) (Terence Morgan), a wealthy arts patron whom members of the expedition meet on the ship returning to England, harbors a crucial revelation of the mummy's past and future.","m_cast":"Terence Morgan: Adam Beauchamp, a secretive key character | Ronald Howard: John Bray, the Egyptologist | Fred Clark: Alexander King, the American promoter | Jeanne Roland: Annette Dubois, daughter of Professor Dubois (the Egyptologist who is killed in the opening scene) and John Bray's fiancée | George Pastell: Hashmi Bey, representative of Egypt's colonial government and worshipful supplicant of the Mummy | Jack Gwillim: Sir Giles Dalrymple, another Egyptologist | John Paul: Inspector Mackenzie | Dickie Owen: the Mummy | Jill Mai Meredith: Jenny, Beauchamp's maid | Michael Ripper: Achmed, Egyptian servant | Harold Goodwin: Fred, one of Alexander King's workmen | Jimmy Gardner: Fred's mate | Vernon Smythe: Jessop, Beauchamp's butler | Marianne Stone: Hashmi Bey's landlady | Ray Austin: Stuntman: Assassin on-board ship","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Unlike most Hammer films of that period, it was filmed at Elstree Studios, rather than the company's permanent home at Bray.
