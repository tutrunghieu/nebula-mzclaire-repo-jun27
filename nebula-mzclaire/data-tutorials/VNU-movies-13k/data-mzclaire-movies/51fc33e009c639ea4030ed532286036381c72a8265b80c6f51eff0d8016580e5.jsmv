{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Promising golfer Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) is the favorite son of Savannah, Georgia and a noteworthy golfer; Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) was his girlfriend from a wealthy family before he went off to war. While serving as a captain in the US Army during World War I, Junuh is traumatized when his entire company is wiped out in battle. Though he earns the Medal of Honor, he returns to Georgia and lives a shadowy life as a drunk, golf being just a distant memory. | Years later (circa 1930[6]), at the start of the Great Depression, Adele is trying to recover her family's lost fortune by holding a four-round, two-day exhibition match between Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), the best golfers of the era, with a grand prize of $10,000, at a golf resort her father built as the Depression struck. However, she needs a local participant to generate local interest, so she asks her estranged love Junuh to play. | Junuh is approached by a mysterious traveler carrying a suitcase, who appears while Junuh is trying to hit golf balls into the dark void of night. The man identifies himself as Bagger Vance (Will Smith) and says he will be Junuh's caddy. He then helps Junuh to come to grips with his personal demons and helps him to play golf again. | When the match starts, Jones and Hagen each play well in their distinctive ways, but the disengaged Junuh plays poorly and is far behind after the first round. With Bagger caddying for him and giving advice, Junuh rediscovers his \"authentic swing\" in the second round and makes up some ground. In the third round, he closes the gap even more. Junuh and Adele also find their romance rekindling. | Late in the final round, Junuh disregards Bagger's advice at a crucial point and after that plays poorly. He hits a ball into a forest, where he has a traumatic World War I flashback, but Bagger's words help him to focus on golf. Junuh pulls back to a tie with Jones and Hagen, then has a chance to win on the final hole, but has the integrity to call a penalty on himself when his ball moves after he tries to remove an obstacle. | Seeing from this that Junuh has grown and matured, Bagger decides his golfer doesn't need him any more. Bagger leaves him as mysteriously as he met him, with the 18th hole unfinished. Though losing a chance to win because of the penalty, Junuh sinks an improbable putt and the match ends in a gentlemanly three-way tie. The three golfers shake hands with all of Savannah cheering, and Junuh and Adele get back together. | During the match, Bagger Vance has a young assistant, Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), who caddies after Bagger leaves. Hardy experiences a heart attack and loses consciousness. Ultimately, Hardy, now an old man (Jack Lemmon), awakens and sees a never-aging Bagger Vance on the golf course. As Bagger beckons, Hardy follows, possibly to the after life.","m_cast":"Will Smith as Bagger Vance | Matt Damon as Rannulph Junuh | Charlize Theron as Adele Invergordon | Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen | Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones | J.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 43% based on 129 reviews.[11] | Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave it 3½ stars, said, \"It handles a sports movie the way Billie Holiday handled a trashy song, by finding the love and pain beneath the story. Redford and his writer, Jeremy Leven, starting from a novel by Steven Pressfield, are very clear in their minds about what they want to do. They want to explain why it is possible to devote your life to the love of golf, and they want to hint that golf and life may have a lot in common\".[12] The BBC's George Perry called it a \"sumptuously photographed film\" but added that \"in spite of being lovely to look at, it is pretentious piffle, although Will Smith shows skill and subtlety in his ludicrous role\".[13] | Time called it one of the most \"embarrassing\" films of recent years for its treatment of African Americans and the use of a \"Magical African-American Friend\".[5] | The Legend of Bagger Vance opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, grossing $11,516,712 from 2,061 theaters.[14] According to the Internet Movie Data Base website (imdb.com), the film's total gross came to $30,695,227, far short of its estimated $60 million budget.[15]","m_production":"The plot is roughly based on the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana, where the Warrior/Hero Arjuna and Hanuman (R. Junuh) refuses to fight. The god Krishna and jambvan appears as Bhagavan or brahman (Bagger Vance) to help him to follow his path as the warrior and hero that he was meant to be. This relationship was fully explained by Steven J. Rosen in his book Gita on the Green, for which Steven Pressfield wrote the foreword.[7] | Portions of the exhibition match were set at the Kiawah Island Golf Resort in South Carolina, United States, considered one of the toughest in the country. Jack Lemmon had his movie heart attack on No. 11 of the resort's Cougar Point golf course. The final hole in the film was temporary, so the filming did not interfere with the club activities, and cost US $200,000 to build. However, most of the golf scenes were filmed at Colleton River Plantation,[8] just off Hilton Head Island.[9] Certain segments of this film were also filmed in Savannah, Georgia, USA and Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA.[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Legend of Bagger Vance by Steven Pressfield","m_directed_by":"Robert Redford","m_produced_by":"Michael Nozik Jake Eberts Robert Redford","m_screenplay_by":"Jeremy Leven","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jack Lemmon","m_music_by":"Rachel Portman","m_cinematography":"Michael Ballhaus","m_edited_by":"Hank Corwin","m_production_company":"Allied Filmmakers","m_distributed_by":"DreamWorks Pictures (USA) 20th Century Fox (non-USA)","m_release_dates":"November 3, 2000 (2000-11-03) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"126 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$80 million","m_box_office":"$39,459,427[1] | The Legend of Bagger Vance is a 2000 American sports drama film directed by Robert Redford, and stars Will Smith, Matt Damon and Charlize Theron.
