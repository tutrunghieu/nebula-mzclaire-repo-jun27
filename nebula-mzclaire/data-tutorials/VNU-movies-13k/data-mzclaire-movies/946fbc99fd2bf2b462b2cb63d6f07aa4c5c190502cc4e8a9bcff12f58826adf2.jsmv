The British are worried that this new Italian tactic will give the enemy naval supremacy in the Mediterranean. From Spain, an Italian expert on underwater operations is secretly watching the British base in Gibraltar and planning new attacks. | Maverick diver Lionel Crabb is brought in to head the British response. He creates a team of divers to intercept the Italian attacks and defuse the bombs. The Italians plan a major attack on a British convoy, but Crabb and another diver manage to infiltrate the Spanish docks from which the Italians are planning the attack, identifying the ship (the Olterra) which the Italians attack from. Crabb leads an unauthorised pre-emptive strike on the ship carrying the torpedoes and destroys it, winning the George Medal. | The British divers are shown as using Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Commander CrabbÂ  by Marshall Pugh","m_directed_by":"William Fairchild","m_produced_by":"Bertram Ostrer Raymond Anzarut","m_screenplay_by":"William Fairchild","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Laurence Harvey Dawn Addams John Clements Michael Craig Sid James","m_music_by":"William Alwyn","m_cinematography":"Otto Heller","m_edited_by":"Alan Osbiston","m_production_company":"Romulus Films","m_distributed_by":"Universal-International","m_release_dates":"1958","m_running_time":"112 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Silent Enemy is a 1958 action film directed by William Fairchild.
