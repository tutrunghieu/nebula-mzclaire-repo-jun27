{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) is a pre-medical student at University of Wisconsin–Madison. Across the Atlantic, Denmark's Prince Edvard (Luke Mably), heir to the throne, regularly shirks his princely duties (including opening a cabinet meeting) by acting recklessly (like drag racing). | While watching television after a cabinet meeting, Edvard sees a commercial for a reality show set in Wisconsin called College Girls Gone Wild, featuring drunken co-eds flashing their breasts. After meeting with his parents, King Haraald (James Fox), and Queen Rosalind (Miranda Richardson), Edvard announces his intentions to attend college in America—specifically, Wisconsin. While his parents do not want him to go, Edvard tells them he will go with or without their consent, and that he does not want any help or money. The Queen then dispatches Edvard's assistant, Søren (Ben Miller), to chaperone the trip to America. | When Edvard arrives at the university, he orders Søren keep his identity a secret, and to call him \"Eddie.\" Later at a bar Eddie sees Paige, where he flirts with her. Eddie then asks Paige to take off her shirt, like the girls in the College Girls Gone Wild advertisement did. Paige angrily drenches Eddie with the drink hose, and bouncers escort Eddie (and Søren, who came to his rescue) from the bar. To Paige's annoyance, she and Eddie are also assigned as lab partners for an organic chemistry class. Since the class is important for Paige's medical school ambitions, she warns Eddie to not get in her way, and reprimands him after he sleeps through one of their lab experiments. After running out of money, Eddie gets a job in the deli section of the bar, even using Paige as a reference. Paige reluctantly helps him during his first day. Eddie later asks her out, but she refuses. | After Eddie helps Paige learn how to interpret Shakespeare, and Paige teaches him how to do laundry, Paige is goaded by a friend to invite him to her home for Thanksgiving. While there, Eddie takes part in a lawn mower race, even beating the Morgan family's rival. However, a fistfight ensues. After patching up his wounds, Eddie and Paige kiss. | Back at school, Eddie and Paige sneak off to the library stacks to pursue a romantic encounter of unspecified nature. While there, the paparazzi ambush the stunned couple. Once away from the mayhem, Paige learns of his real identity. Feeling betrayed and accusing him of lying, she leaves. | At the end of the day, Eddie is notified by his mother that his father is very ill, prompting him to return. While Paige faces a panel of professors questioning her about Shakespeare and love, she realizes that she loves Edvard and runs to find him, only to discover that he has already left for Denmark. She goes after him, and upon arriving in Copenhagen her trip is delayed, as a parade honoring the royal family is blocking traffic. Paige is recognized by the crowd, and Edvard finds her and takes her to the castle on horseback. | The queen objects to Edvard's choice to marry Paige, but the king tells him that if he loves Paige, he should marry her. Edvard proposes and Paige accepts. | Paige struggles with conforming to the lifestyle of royalty, however, the queen warms to her. Then, she takes Paige to a little room with jewelry to get ready for the coronation ball, which follows King Haraald's abdication. During the coronation ball, Edvard and Paige share their first dance and then sneak off together. After being left alone, Paige remembers her dream for Doctors Without Borders. When Edvard returns, she tells him that she does not want to sacrifice her dreams, and that she cannot be queen. She then returns to Wisconsin and graduates from college, where she has been accepted to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. | King Edvard arrives after the graduation, where he expresses that he wants to marry her and he is willing to wait until she completes medical school and achieves her dreams. She confesses that Denmark may not be ready for a queen like her, but he says that he is, leading them to kiss passionately.","m_cast":"Julia Stiles as Paige Morgan | Luke Mably as Edvard, Crown Prince of Denmark/Edvard III, King of Denmark (\"Eddie Williams\") | Ben Miller as Søren | Miranda Richardson as Rosalind, Queen consort of Denmark | James Fox as Haraald, King of Denmark | Alberta Watson as Amy Morgan | John Bourgeois as Ben Morgan | Zachary Knighton as John Morgan | Stephen O'Reilly as Mike Morgan | Elisabeth Waterston as Beth Curtis | Eliza Bennett as Princess Arabella | Devin Ratray as Scotty | Clare Preuss as Stacey | Yaani King as Amanda | Eddie Irvine as Himself | Angelo Tsarouchas as Stu | Jacques Tourangeau as Professor Amiel | Joanne Baron as Margueritte - Royal Designer | Stephen Singer as Professor Begler | Sarah Manninen as Krista | Tony Munch as Keith Kopetsky | John Nelles as Race Announcer | Claus Bue as Lutheran Archbishop","m_reception":"Critics gave the film mostly negative reviews and Rotten Tomatoes rated it 27% based on 116 reviews giving it an overall \"rotten\" rating.
