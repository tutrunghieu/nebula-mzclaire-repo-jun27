Months later after recovering, Dawson learns that his close friend and surrogate father, Tuck Hostetler (Gerald McRaney), has died and returns home for the first time in almost twenty years to carry out Tuck's final wishes. When he arrives at his house, Dawson is surprised to find that Tuck also arranged for Dawson's high school girlfriend, Amanda Collier (Michelle Monaghan), to join him.

Before the prom, Dawson's father (Sean Bridgers) and brothers beat Tuck. Dawson, angered, goes to his fathers house with the intent of killing him with Tuck's rifle. However, they scuffle, and Dawson's cousin, an expectant teen father, is accidentally killed. In exchange for a lighter sentence, Dawson testifies against his father and brothers. However, since Dawson will not be paroled for another four years, he cuts ties with Amanda, forcing her to choose college over staying with him. | After Tuck's death, Amanda and Dawson meet with Tuck's lawyer and learn that they are to scatter Tuck's ashes at a cottage he owned with his wife. Later, Dawson and Amanda spend a passionate night together. They have lunch and discuss their plans, during which Amanda learns that Dawson knew she had continued to try to visit him in prison. The following day, Amanda decides to return to her family and her strained marriage, to meet her family commitments. | When Amanda goes home, Dawson remains at Tuck's to restore the garden. However, she later plans to split up with her husband, and she leaves Dawson a voicemail expressing her love. | After she left the voicemail, she receives a call from which she learns that her son needs a heart transplant. Having lost her daughter already, she feels miserable on hearing this news. Soon her son gets a heart transplant surgery donor. The next morning when she wakes up, she sees Dawson sitting by her side watching her sleep, though he was not actually there. She is informed that Dawson was shot and killed by his father, who is later arrested. | One year later, she receives a call from her son, who finds out that the name of the donor whose heart he received was Dawson Cole. She later visits Tuck's house and finds a letter for her written by Dawson in which he says that he understands that she has her commitments and she wants to keep them and he could only love her more for that. She walks in the garden, which has been restored by Dawson. | In an alternate ending on the DVD, Amanda leaves her husband and she and Dawson get together and enjoy walking through Tuck's garden and the end credits roll.","m_cast":"James Marsden as Dawson Cole[5] | Michelle Monaghan as Amanda Collier[7] | Sebastian Arcelus as Frank Reynolds[9] | Gerald McRaney as Tuck Hostetler[9] | Sean Bridgers as Tommy Cole | Rob Mello as Ted Cole | Hunter Burke as Abee Cole | Jon Tenney as Harvey Collier[10] | Caroline Goodall as Evelyn | Ian Nelson as Jared | Schuyler Fisk as Older April | Robby Rasmussen as Bobby Cole / Aaron Cole | Julia Lashae as Clara","m_reception":"The Best of Me opened in North America on October 17, 2014 across 2,936 theaters.
