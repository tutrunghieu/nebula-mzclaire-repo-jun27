Several days later, Lauren is attacked by Frank Beasley, a handyman, at the house. Amidst the attack, he begins to levitate, and flees the house in terror; he has a vision of two women's corpses lying in his truck, and he flees into the woods, and stumbles into a pond, where he is dragged under and drowns. | Lauren, bothered by the events occurring in the house, visits a local man, Abner Welles, to ask about the house, after having heard Frank mention his name. Abner, a drunk with a bad reputation in town, becomes erratic and violent when she inquires about the house's history, and chases her away in his car. The two get into a car accident, and Lauren flees on foot and hides in a barn. Abner finds her, and attempts to attack her with a pitchfork, but it is torn from his hands by an unseen force. Lauren then stabs him through the head with a scythe, killing him. | Lauren's visions in the house become increasingly bizarre, and she begins having premonitory dreams. It is revealed by Col. Lebrun to Daniel that the home was a former brothel during World War II, and that several men in town murdered the prostitutes in the home and dumped their bodies in the nearby pond.
