{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Bird Island, an island inhabited by flightless birds, Red who lived worst and lonely life because of his orphan status, his bushy eyebrows and everyone made fun of him. He soon gets sentenced to anger management classes after his temper causes a \"premature hatching\" of a customer's egg when he was working as cake delivering clown.One day, in the middle of a class taught by Matilda and attended by fellow students Charles \"Chuck\", Bomb, and Terrence, a boat docks at the island's shore. It carries green-colored pigs, who claim to be peaceful explorers bringing offerings of friendship, and are accepted on the island. They introduce the birds to innovative technologies such as slingshots and helium balloons. | More pigs arrive and seemingly adjust to society, but Red becomes suspicious of their motives, as they slowly overwhelm the island. He recruits Chuck and Bomb to help him find Mighty Eagle, a giant bald eagle said to be the protector of the island, and the only bird that can fly. They manage to find him on top of Bird Mountain. But unfortunately, they shockingly discover that Mighty Eagle can barely fly, is self-absorbed, overweight, and largely in retirement. Looking through the Mighty Eagle's binoculars, Red's group discover that the pigs are planting explosives around the island, having distracted the birds with a rave party. They realize that the pigs plan to steal the birds' eggs for food. Red and Bomb attempt to retrieve the eggs, while Chuck attempts to warn the rest of the birds, but the pigs escape and their explosives destroy the village. When the birds realize what happened, Red finally gets a chance to help everyone use their own anger and bring their own eggs back. | The birds construct a boat and sail to Piggy Island, where they find the pigs living in a walled city. Deducing the eggs are most likely in the central castle of the city, the birds attack and defeats the pigs by firing themselves into the pig village using a giant slingshot gifted to them by the pigs, which is later accidentally broken by Terence. Red, Chuck, and Bomb make it to the castle and find the eggs in a boiler room, where the pigs plan to cook and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives, having had a change of heart and remembering the inspiration that Red has gave him, and carries the eggs out. | As the birds escape, an egg falls out and rolls back into the castle. Red returns to the castle, retrieves the egg, and after the long fight between him and Leonard (King of Pigs) he defends the egg and with the help of a huge cooking utensil he takes cover and survives Piggy Island's destruction caused by the pigs' reserve of explosives. Red then saves three, blue newborn birds that hatched from the egg after the explosion. He is declared a hero and given a new home. He, Chuck, and Bomb are approached by Mighty Eagle, who is revealed that he wasn't lazy but rather deliberately made the birds lose faith in him so they could find faith in themselves. | In a mid-credits sequence, it is revealed that some of the pigs survived Piggy Island's destruction and have begun to hatch a new plan to steal the eggs. | In a second mid-credits scene, the three blue birds rescued by Red use the rebuilt slingshot to launch themselves out to sea.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"As of July 3, 2016[update], The Angry Birds Movie has grossed $105.7 million in North America and $231.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $336.8 million.[4] Worldwide, it is the second highest-grossing video game film of all-time, behind Warcraft ($422 million).[41] | In North America, the film opened on May 20, 2016, alongside Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising and The Nice Guys and was projected to gross between $35–40 million, possibly going as high as $45 million, from 3,932 theaters in its opening weekend.[37][42][43] Deadline.com noted that the film has the benefit of being the only animated feature until Disney/Pixar's Finding Dory arrives in theaters on June 17.[43] Fandango reported that The Angry Birds Movie was the top selling film for the weekend, pacing in tandem with Hotel Transylvania 2.[37] It grossed $800,000 from its Thursday night previews[37] and $11 million on its opening day.[44] In its opening weekend it grossed $38.2 million, finishing first at the box office and marked the third biggest Sony animated opening of all time, behind Hotel Transylvania and Hotel Transylvania 2.[37][45] It also scored the second-best debut weekend ever for a video game adaptation, behind the $47 million debut of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.[46] It had a 51% drop in its second weekend after facing competition from X-Men: Apocalypse and Alice Through the Looking Glass, grossing $18.7 million.[41] | Internationally, The Angry Birds Movie was released in the Philippines on May 11[47] and 74 other markets (63% of its total marketplace) on May 13, at least one week ahead of its US release.
