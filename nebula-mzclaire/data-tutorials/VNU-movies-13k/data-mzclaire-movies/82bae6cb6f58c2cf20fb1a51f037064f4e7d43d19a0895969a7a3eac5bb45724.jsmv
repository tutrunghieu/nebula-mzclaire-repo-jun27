Bunner and was originally purchased by Roach as a vehicle for Roland Young. Other points of interest about Zenobia include the fact that the music was by Marvin Hatley, the composer of \"The Cuckoo Song,\" Laurel and Hardy's famous theme song.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Gordon Douglas","m_produced_by":"Hal Roach","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Oliver Hardy Harry Langdon Billie Burke Alice Brady Hattie McDaniel","m_music_by":"Marvin Hatley","m_cinematography":"Karl Struss Norbert Brodine","m_edited_by":"Bert Jordan","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"United Artists","m_release_dates":"1939 (1939) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"73 min. 65 min (colour cut edition)","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | Zenobia (also known as Elephants Never Forget (UK) and It's Spring Again) is a 1939 comedy film starring Oliver Hardy, Harry Langdon, Billie Burke, Alice Brady, James Ellison, Jean Parker, June Lang, Stepin Fetchit, and Hattie McDaniel. It is one of the few films after the teaming of Laurel and Hardy that features Hardy without Stan Laurel,[1] the result of a contract dispute between Laurel and producer Hal Roach, who maintained separate contracts for each performer, rather than a team contract, which would have offered them more control over their careers. Zenobia was Roach's attempt to create a new comedic pair without Laurel, and a series of films with Hardy and Langdon was planned. The dispute was short-lived, however, and Laurel and Hardy were reunited shortly thereafter.[2] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"Zenobia at the Internet Movie Database | Zenobia at AllMovie | Zenobia at the TCM Movie Database | 1926-1957 Legendary Laurel & Hardy's 31+ years still Record Long comic duo Partnership / boys' legacy, unequaled longevity!!! | The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Zenobia","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/Zenobia1939.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Corey Ford"}
