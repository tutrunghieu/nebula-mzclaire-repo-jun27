On Rotten Tomatoes, it currently holds a 32% score based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The site's consensus states: \"Under the Cherry Moon may satisfy the most rabid Prince fans, but everyone else will be better served with this vanity project's far superior soundtrack.\"[9] | The film was a multiple winner at the 7th Golden Raspberry Awards, winning five awards. The categories were: Worst Picture (tied with Howard the Duck), Worst Actor and Worst Director (Prince), Worst Supporting Actor (Jerome Benton), and Worst Original Song (\"Love or Money\").
