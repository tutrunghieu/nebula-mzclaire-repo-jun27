In spite of the mission's extreme difficulty, his plan is finally put into effect against a German aircraft factory. | During preparation for the raid, Brandon alienates his men by insisting that normal bombing operations continue. His disdain for cautious Lieutenant Archer (Ben Murphy) and brash RAF Wing Commander Trafton Howard (Gary Marshal) further antagonizes his associates, including his girl friend, WAC Lieutenant Gabrielle Ames (Laraine Stephens). | When his bomber crashes the morning of the mission, Brandon boards a bomber manned by Archer and Howard. During the effective air raid, he is impressed by Archer's courage and Howard's judgment.","m_cast":"Christopher George as Col Greg Brandon | Laraine Stephens as Lt. Gabrielle Ames | J.D.

Quimby","m_reception":"Critical reviews commented on the \"stereotyped adventure yarn\" aspect of the production while noting that the aerial footage was often exciting.[5]","m_production":"The film was shot in a budget-conscious manner. The main sets were in Santa Maria, California, and principal photography took place in winter 1968. The local village and airport realistically portrayed a typical British wartime base. Period-style maintenance shops, an operations center and a wartime-style control tower were added to re-create the fictional Steeple Bassington base.[4] Additional studio work was completed at the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in Hollywood.[5] | Aerial sequences included a mix of stock wartime footage, including the Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944), some of it colorized to match original footage.[4] The air-boss was legendary Hollywood stunt pilot Frank Tallman, but the most spectacular scene was a low-flying B-17 scene flown by Don Lykins. Another crash scene was taken from Twelve O'Clock High, the famous crash-landing carried out by Paul Mantz, another of Hollywood's leading stunt pilots, and Tallman's one-time partner in Tallmantz Aviation, before his death in 1965.[6] Three Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers (DB-17P 44-83684 [N3713G] from The Air Museum at Ontario, California, DB-17P 44-83525 [N83525], from Tallmantz Aviation at Santa Ana, California, and B-17F 42-29782 [N17W]) from Aircraft Specialties at Mesa, Arizona, were used in the production.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Boris Sagal","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Christopher George Laraine Stephens","m_music_by":"Jimmie Haskell","m_cinematography":"William Spencer","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":"Oakmont Productions","m_distributed_by":"United Artists","m_release_dates":"July 1969 (1969-07) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"93 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Thousand Plane Raid (aka The One Thousand Plane Raid[2]) is a 1969 film directed by Boris Sagal.
