{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The opening titles announce it is set \"possibly around 1933.\" The story concerns the 168-year-old Fu Manchu, who must duplicate the ingredients to the elixir vitae (which gives him extended life) after the original is accidentally destroyed by one of Fu's minions. | When the diamond \"The Star of Leningrad\" is stolen by a clockwork spider from a Soviet exhibition in Washington D.C., the F.B.I. sends a pair of special agents to seek the assistance of Scotland Yard as a card from Fu Manchu's organisation the Si-Fan has been left at the crime. Sir Roger Avery of the Yard feels this is a job for Fu's nemesis, Sir Denis Nayland-Smith, now retired. | Nayland-Smith correctly surmises that Fu Manchu will steal the identical twin to the missing diamond that is held in the Tower of London. Nayland-Smith also predicts that Fu will be thwarted by the tight security (several aged Beefeaters) at the Tower, then will kidnap Queen Mary to gain the jewel. He recruits a woman police constable to impersonate the Queen and fool Fu's gang. One of the officers, an obese Chinese cuisine loving glutton who has been ordered by the doctor to walk around for five miles a day on stilts, is promised access to Fu's outdoor restaurant of Chinese food and helps them steal the diamond. In the finale to the film, Nayland and his fellow officers visit Manchu's mountain base in his flying country house, \"The Pride of Wiltshire\", taking the real diamond with him which Manchu later uses to make himself young and vibrant again. Before taking the elixir, Manchu warns Smith that his latest fiendish plot will wipe out his enemies. Smith rejoins his fellow officers in time to see a rejuvenated Fu Manchu sporting an Elvis Presley type jumpsuit, rise from the floor and, with his cohorts now forming a rock and roll band, sing the song \"Rockin Fu Music\".","m_cast":"Peter Sellers as Fu Manchu / Nayland Smith | Helen Mirren as Alice Rage | David Tomlinson as Sir Roger Avery | Sid Caesar as Joe Capone | Simon Williams as Robert Townsend | Steve Franken as Pete Williams | Stratford Johns as Ismail | John Le Mesurier as Perkins | John Sharp as Sir Nules Thudd | Clément Harari as Dr. Wretch | Burt Kwouk as Servant | Kwan-Young Lee as Tong | John Tan as Dacoit | Philip Tan as Dacoit | Serge Julien as Dacoit | Johns Rajohnson as Dacoit | Sellers also appears in an uncredited cameo as a Mexican bandito.","m_reception":"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu was universally panned by critics. Sellers appears unwell and tired throughout the film and his characterizations of Nayland-Smith and Fu Manchu are both portrayed in a mostly subdued and quiet fashion. Phil Hardy described the film as a \"British atrocity\".[9] Orange Coast Magazine wrote \"Peter Seller's last hurrah isn't nearly as impressive as his recent Being There. Even in the dual roles ... detective and the devious 168-year- old Fu Manchu, he musters only an occasional bright moment.[10] Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as \"an indefensibly inept comedy\",[11] adding that \"it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. \"Manchu\" will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as Where Does It Hurt, The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda\".[11]","m_production":"The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—Richard Quine and John Avildsen—both fired before the script had been completed.[4] Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu[5] with his ill-health often causing delays.[6] Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences.[7] | Piers Haggard later recalled: | It was a very disagreeable experience on that film. I was brought in on an off-chance. He [Sellers]’d agreed to do a fairly stock Hollywood comedy thriller, similar to The Pink Panther really, playing a detective and a villain. And he’d fallen out of love with that project and didn’t want to do that script. They said, ‘Okay, what do you want to do?’ and he said, ‘Let me go off and do a bit of rewriting.’ So he went off with a Hollywood hack and turned it into a series of Goon Show sketches. The executives were absolutely appalled. They thought, ‘Oh my God, we thought he had a picture and now we’ve got a development situation.’ I knew one of them, so they said, ‘Maybe this guy Haggard could do something with this.’ So I got three weeks’ work to supervise a rewrite, which we did. We made Peter’s script much more coherent, turned it into something with a bit more of a beginning, middle and end. And they were very pleased with that so I got the gig. But then unfortunately within about two weeks my love affair with Peter Sellers was over but I had to soldier on. I did soldier on but it was no fun, absolutely no fun. Then just towards the end of the shooting he decided, which had been obvious, that either he would go or I would go so they got rid of me. I didn’t have much choice. So I was retired and he directed for the last week or so. It was pretty much a disaster from beginning to end.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Piers Haggard Peter Sellers Richard Quine","m_produced_by":"Zev Braun Leland Nolan Hugh Hefner","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Sellers Helen Mirren David Tomlinson Sid Caesar John Le Mesurier","m_music_by":"Marc Wilkinson","m_cinematography":"Jean Tournier","m_edited_by":"Claudine Bouché Russell Lloyd","m_production_company":"Braun Entertainment Group Playboy Productions","m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures Corporation Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"8 August 1980 (1980-08-08) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"101 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$10,697,276 | The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is a 1980 comedy film, primarily notable as the final film of Peter Sellers, David Tomlinson and John Le Mesurier. Pre-production began with Richard Quine as director. By the time the film entered production, Piers Haggard had replaced him. Peter Sellers handled the re-shoots himself.[1] Based on characters created by Sax Rohmer, the film stars Sellers in the dual role of Fu Manchu, a stereotypical Chinese evil genius,[2] and English country gentleman detective Nayland Smith. Released only two weeks after Sellers death, the film was a commercial and critical failure. It was also the final screen appearance for Tomlinson, who retired from acting shortly before its release. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Review\". The Spokesman-Review. 15 May 1980.
