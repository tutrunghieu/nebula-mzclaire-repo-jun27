{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Philadelphia in 1961, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare disease that renders sufferers' bones extremely fragile and prone to fracture. As revealed later in flashbacks, Elijah—who grows up to become a comic-book art dealer—develops a theory, based on the comics he has read during his many hospital stays, that if he represents extreme human frailty, there must be someone \"unbreakable\" at the opposite extreme. | Years later, another Philadelphia man, security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis), is also searching for meaning in his life. He had given up a promising football career during his collegiate days to marry Audrey (Robin Wright) after they were involved in an auto accident. Now, however, their marriage is dissolving, to the distress of their young son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). | As he returns home from a job interview in New York City, David's train crashes, killing the other 131 passengers, while he is the only survivor, sustaining no injuries. At the memorial for the crash's victims, he finds a card on his car's windshield, inviting him to Elijah's store. Elijah proposes to David that he is the kind of person after whom comic-book superheroes are modeled, and repeatedly pursues the issue with David and Audrey, trying to learn if David had ever been ill or injured during childhood. Although Elijah unsettles him, David begins to test himself. While lifting weights with Joseph, he bench presses 350 pounds, well above what he had thought he could do. Joseph begins to idolize his father and believes he is a superhero, although David still maintains he is \"an ordinary man.\" | David challenges Elijah with an incident from his childhood when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car in order to save Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football, because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport. | Under Elijah's influence, David develops what he thought was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David stands in the middle of a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invaded a family home, killed the parents, and is holding the children hostage. | David follows the janitor to the victims' house and frees the children, but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off a balcony into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns, but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. That night, he and Audrey reconcile. The following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper article on this anonymous heroic act, depicting a sketch of David in his rain poncho, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father. | David attends an exhibition at Elijah's comic book art gallery and meets Elijah's mother (Charlayne Woodard), who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength versus those who use their intelligence. Elijah brings David to the back room of his studio, extends his hand, and asks David to shake it. Upon doing so, David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters, including David's recent train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. David is horrified, but Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find him. Calling himself \"Mr. Glass\" (a nickname his peers had used to taunt him with when he was growing up), he explains that his own purpose in life is to be the villain to David's hero. | Screen captions reveal that David reported Elijah's actions to the police, and that Elijah was convicted of murder and terrorism and committed to an institution for the criminally insane.","m_cast":"Bruce Willis as David Dunn/Security Davis Duffield as David Dunn (age 20) | Samuel L.

The film ended up earning $95,011,339 domestically and $153,106,782 internationally for a total of $248,118,121, above its 75 million production budget.[15] | Unbreakable received mostly positive reviews from critics and has a rating of 68% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 161 reviews with an average score of 6.2 out of 10. The consensus states \"With a weaker ending, Unbreakable is not as a good as The Sixth Sense. However, it is a quietly suspenseful film that intrigues and engages, taking the audience through unpredictable twists and turns along the way.\"[16] The film also has a score of 62 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 31 critics indicating Generally favorable reviews.[17] | Roger Ebert largely enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with the ending. Ebert believed that Willis' \"subtle acting\" was positively different from the actor's usual work in \"brainless action movies\".[18] Richard Corliss of Time magazine reviewed that Unbreakable continued Shyamalan's writing/direction of \"balancing sophistication and horror in all of his movies\".[19] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post wrote that \"just as he did in The Sixth Sense, writer-director M. Night Shyamalan leads you into a fascinating labyrinth, an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses. In this case, it's the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books.\"[20] | Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, gave a negative review, arguing that Unbreakable had no originality. \"Whether it means to or not, the shadow of The Sixth Sense hangs over Unbreakable,\" Turan reasoned. \"If The Sixth Sense hadn't been as big a success as it was, this story might have been assigned to oblivion, or at least to rewrite.\"[21] Todd McCarthy of Variety mostly criticized Shyamalan's writing and the performances given by the actors. He did praise Dylan Tichenor's editing and James Newton Howard's music composition.[22] | Shyamalan admitted he was disappointed by the reaction Unbreakable received from the public and critics.[23] Shyamalan also disliked Touchstone Pictures' marketing campaign. He wanted to promote Unbreakable as a comic book movie, but Touchstone insisted on portraying it as a psychological thriller, similar to The Sixth Sense.[24] | In 2009, Oscar-winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Unbreakable, and included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992, the year he became a director. Tarantino praised the film as a \"brilliant retelling of the Superman mythology\", and said it contains what he considers to be Bruce Willis' best performance. He also criticized the way the film was marketed upon release, stating he felt that it would have been far more effective if the film's advertising simply posed the question of \"what if Superman was here on earth, and didn't know he was Superman?\"[25] In 2011, Time ranked the film at #4 in its list of top ten superhero movies of all time, describing it as one of the best superhero origin stories and as a \"relatively quiet, subtle and realistic look at the pressures that come with being a superhero.\"[4]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"M.

Filming for Unbreakable began in April 2000 and was completed by July. | Unbreakable received generally positive reviews,[2] praising its aesthetics, the acting performances and particularly the musical score by James Newton Howard.
