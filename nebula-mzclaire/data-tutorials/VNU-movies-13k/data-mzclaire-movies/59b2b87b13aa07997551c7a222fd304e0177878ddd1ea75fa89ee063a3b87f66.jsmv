{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the 1997 general election, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) becomes Britain's newly elected prime minister. However, the Queen (Helen Mirren) is wary of Blair and his pledge to modernise Britain, despite his promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales dies in a car crash at the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley), prepares a speech in which Diana is described as the people's princess. The phrase catches on and millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the royal family is still at their summer estate in Balmoral Castle. Diana's death sparks division amongst members of the family, with some of the view that since Diana was divorced from Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) a year prior to her death, she was no longer a part of the royal family. They argue that Diana's funeral arrangements are thus best left as a private affair of her noble family, the Spencers. Charles, however, argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, and persuades the Queen to authorise the use of an aircraft of the Royal Air Force to bring Diana's body back to Britain. | In London, flowers begin to pile up before the palace railings, which forces the changing of the Queen's Guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the royal family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the royal family's popularity plummets, Blair's acceptance rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife, Cherie (Helen McCrory). However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair tells his wife that a republican Britain is ludicrous and begins to denounce the anti-monarchical views of his Labour Party advisers. Blair immediately calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends three strong measures to regain public confidence of the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address. | Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the royal family including Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms), viewing such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, \"Candle in the Wind\", in Diana's memory. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea by saying that she is one of the greatest assets the monarchy has ever had, stating: \"The real problem will come when you leave\". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her \"whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong...\". Meanwhile, Philip tries to distract William and Harry (Jake Taylor Shantos and Dash Barber) from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her Land Rover, the Queen damages it crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic red deer which Philip had been stalking with William and Harry. The Queen is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, the Queen shoos the animal away and decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend a public funeral for Diana, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate, asks to see the stag, and is upset at its loss. | The royal family finally returns to London to inspect the floral tributes to Diana. While watching live television coverage with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his advisers, declaring that the Queen is admirable and that Diana had rejected everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice to make a public statement on live television, in which she speaks about the life and legacy of Diana and describes her as an exceptional and gifted human being. Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace to attend a weekly meeting with the Queen. The Queen has finally regained her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from that week. The Queen warns Blair that he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him, and states that life in Britain has changed and that the monarchy must modernise in the future. When Blair suggests that he can help with this, the Queen replies to him: \"Don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister. Remember, I'm supposed to be the one advising you\".","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film exceeded box-office expectations; with a budget of $15 million the film earned $56.4 million in the United States and Canada.[20] | Before the film was released, critics praised both Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan, who later received Golden Globe and Academy Award-nominations for Best Director and Best Screenplay. Michael Sheen's performance as Tony Blair earned him particular acclaim. Helen Mirren's portrayal garnered her acclaim from critics around the world. Her portrayal made her a favourite for the Academy Award for Best Actress well before the film was released in theatres. After its showing at the Venice Film Festival, Mirren received a five-minute-long standing ovation.[21] Roger Ebert came out of recovery from surgery to give the film a review. He called it \"spellbinding\" and gave it four out of four stars.[22] The Queen was the most critically acclaimed film of 2006 with Mirren being the most critically acclaimed actress of the year. The Queen has 97% positive reviews on the film-critics aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.[23] | Amongst the few negative reviews, Slant Magazine's Nick Schager criticised the insider portraiture of the film as \"somewhat less than revelatory, in part because Morgan's script succumbs to cutie-pie jokiness [...] and broad caricature\", mentioning particularly \"James Cromwell's Prince Philip, who envisions the crowned heads as exiled victims and the gathering crowds as encroaching 'Zulus'\".[24] | The film appeared on many US critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006.[25] | General top ten | Mirren won at least 29 major awards for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, many of which are listed below. She was nominated for at least three more.

Stephen Frears had a clause in his contract from The Deal that allowed him to direct any follow-ups or sequels, and he was officially announced as director in September 2003.[7] The film was shot on location in the United Kingdom, in England in London, Halton House and Waddesdon Manor, in Buckinghamshire, Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire and in Scotland at Balmoral Castle,[citation needed] Castle Fraser[8] and Cluny Castle[9] in Aberdeenshire, and Blairquhan Castle and Culzean Castle in South Ayrshire. | The sets were designed by Alan MacDonald, which won him Best Art Direction in a Contemporary Film from the Art Directors Guild and Best Technical Achievement at the British Independent Film Awards.[10] Mirren says transforming herself into the Queen came almost naturally after the wig and glasses, since she shares a default facial expression—a slightly downturned mouth – with the monarch.[11] She regularly reviewed film and video footage of Elizabeth and kept photographs in her trailer during production.[12] She also undertook extensive voice coaching, faithfully reproducing the Queen's delivery of her televised speech to the world. Morgan has said that her performance was so convincing that, by the end of production, crew members who had been accustomed to slouching or relaxing when they addressed her were standing straight up and respectfully folding their hands behind their backs.[11] Mirren arranged to spend time off-camera with the supporting cast playing other members of the Royal Family, including James Cromwell, Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms so they would be as comfortable with each other as a real family.[12] Shots involving the Queen were shot in 35mm film and shots of Tony Blair were shot in 16mm film to enhance the contrast of different worlds.[13] | ITV's role in the production of the film allowed them an option for its television premiere and it was broadcast on 2 September 2007 (coinciding that weekend with a memorial service to Diana) to an average audience of 7.9 million, winning its timeslot.[14][15] The DVD was released in the UK on 12 March 2007. Special features include a making-of featurette and an audio commentary by Stephen Frears, writer Peter Morgan and Robert Lacey, biographer of Queen Elizabeth II. It was released on Blu-ray and DVD in the USA on 24 April 2007 and, as of 2013[update], US DVD sales had exceeded $29 million.[16] | Some aspects of the characters are known to be true to their real-life counterparts. Cherie Blair's hostility to the monarchy has been widely reported, including her refusal to curtsey.[17] According to Morgan, \"cabbage\" is an actual term of endearment Philip uses for his wife («mon chou» – \"my cabbage\" – is a standard affectionate nickname in French).[11] | Other elements represent characteristics associated with people depicted. The electric guitar seen behind Blair in his personal office is a reference to his past membership in the band Ugly Rumours while a student. The Newcastle United football jersey he wears to a family breakfast is a reference to his support of that team. The film also shows Alastair Campbell coining the term 'the people's princess', but in 2007 he revealed that it was Tony Blair who came up with it.[18] | A notable inaccuracy is that Robin Janvrin is represented as the Queen's private secretary during the aftermath of Diana's death. In fact, that position was then occupied by Janvrin's predecessor, Sir Robert Fellowes, a brother-in-law of Diana, Princess of Wales; Janvrin was the deputy private secretary until 1999. However, the film is accurate in depicting Janvrin as the person who delivered the news of Diana's accident to the Queen at Balmoral during the night.[19]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stephen Frears","m_produced_by":"Andy Harries | Francois Ivernel | Christine Langan | Tracey Seaward","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Helen Mirren | Michael Sheen | James Cromwell | Helen McCrory | Alex Jennings | Roger Allam | Sylvia Syms","m_music_by":"Alexandre Desplat","m_cinematography":"Affonso Beato","m_edited_by":"Lucia Zucchetti","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Pathé Pictures","m_release_dates":"2 September 2006 (2006-09-02) (Venice) | 15 September 2006 (2006-09-15) (United Kingdom) | 18 October 2006 (2006-10-18) (France) |  | ","m_running_time":"103 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom | France | Italy","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£9.8 million ($15 million)","m_box_office":"£77.9 million ($123.4 million)[2] | The Queen is a 2006 British fictional drama film depicting the British Royal Family's response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on 31 August 1997. The film was directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, and starred Helen Mirren in the title role of HM Queen Elizabeth II.[3] | In the film, the Royal Family regards Diana's death as a private affair and thus not to be treated as an official Royal death. This is in contrast with the views of Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband, Prince Charles, who favour the general public's desire for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about Republicanism. | The film's release coincided with a revival of favourable public sentiment in respect to the monarchy and a downturn in fortunes for Blair. Michael Sheen reprised his role as Blair from The Deal, and he did so again in The Special Relationship. The Queen also garnered general critical and popular acclaim for Mirren playing the title role, which earned her numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. Mirren was also praised by the Queen herself and invited to dinner at Buckingham Palace[4] (though she could not attend due to filming commitments in Hollywood).[5] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE QUEEN (12A)\".
