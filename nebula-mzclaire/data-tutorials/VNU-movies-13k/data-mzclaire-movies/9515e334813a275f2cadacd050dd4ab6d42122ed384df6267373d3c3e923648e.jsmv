{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film opens in Gethsemane during the night as Jesus (Jim Caviezel), at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples Peter, James, and John (James' brother) sleep. After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. | After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter attacks, and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. | John tells Mary and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \"I am.\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city, finds solitude, and hangs himself from a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey at dawn. | Caiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death, but after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate instead relays him to the court of Herod Antipas as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth, Galilee. After Jesus is again found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd option that he will chastise Jesus, and release him. He then attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and a violent criminal Barabbas. To his dismay, the crowd demands to have Barabbas freed, and Jesus killed. In an attempt to appease the moment, Pilate orders that he simply be punished. Jesus is brutally scourged, abused, and mocked by the Roman guards as \"king of the Jews\" with a crown of thorns. However, Caiaphas, with the crowds' verbal backing, continues to demand that Jesus be crucified as a heretic, and Barabbas released. Admonished, Pilate washes his hands (taking no responsibility) of the incident, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. During the course of events, Satan watches Jesus' bloody sufferings with great interest. | As Jesus labors to carry a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Veronica avoids the escort of soldiers, and wipes Jesus' face with her veil. Jesus is beaten, and pressed by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their travel, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. The very act seems to affect the weathering condition of the earth itself. As he hangs from the cross, Jesus prays to God, asking forgiveness for the people who did this to him, and redeems a criminal as a saint that is crucified next to him. | Succumbing to impending death, Jesus gives up his spirit, and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the Holy temple and rips the cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown screaming in agonizing defeat. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed form of Jesus rises from the dead, and exits the tomb anew.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Passion of the Christ polarized critics: Jim Caviezel's performance, the musical score, the sound, the makeup, and the cinematography were praised, while the film's graphic violence and alleged antisemitic undertones were singled out for criticism. The film has a \"rotten\" rating of 49% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 268 reviews with an average score of 5.9 out of 10. The consensus states \"The graphic details of Jesus' torture make the movie tough to sit through and obscure whatever message it is trying to convey.\"[64] The film's Metacritic score of 47 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicates \"mixed or average reviews\".[65] | In a positive review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ \"a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment.\"[65] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality.[66] Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie four out of four stars, calling it \"the most violent film [he] ha[s] ever seen\" as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying \"What Gibson has provided for me, for the first time in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it.\"[13] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it \"a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie\",[67] while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was \"the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II\".[68] Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie \"too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read.\"[65] | The June 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly named The Passion of the Christ the most controversial film of all time, followed by Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971).[10] In 2010, Time listed it as one of the most \"ridiculously violent\" films of all time.[69] | A number of independent websites such as MyLifeAfter.com and Passion-Movie.com were launched to promote the film and its message and to allow people to discuss the film's effect on their lives. Documentaries such as Changed Lives: Miracles of the Passion chronicled stories of miraculous savings, forgiveness, new-found faith, and the story of a man who confessed to murdering his girlfriend after authorities determined her death was due to suicide.[70] Another documentary, Impact: The Passion of the Christ, chronicled the popular response of the film in the United States, India, and Japan and examined the claims of antisemitism against Mel Gibson and the film.[citation needed] | National Board of Review, Award for Freedom of Expression (2004) | People's Choice Awards – Favorite Motion Picture Drama (2004) | Satellite Awards – Best Director – Mel Gibson | Moviefone Moviegoer Awards – Best Picture | Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy Award – Best Film Production | Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy Award – Best Film Actress – Maia Morgenstern | Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA, Golden Reel Award – Best Sound Editing in a Feature Film – Music – Michael T.

Because the story of the Passion is so well-known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"[28] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Hebrew. Gibson chose to use Latin instead of Greek, which was the lingua franca of that particular part of the Roman Empire at the time, since there is no source for the Koine Greek spoken in that region. The street Greek spoken in the ancient Levant region of Jesus' day is not the exact Greek language used in the Bible.[29] Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.[30] | The film was produced independently and shot in Italy – primarily at Cinecittà Studios in Rome, in the old city of Matera, and in the ghost town of Craco (Basilicata).[31] The estimated US$30 million production cost, plus an additional estimated $15 million in marketing costs, were fully borne by Gibson and his company, Icon Productions. It was released on Ash Wednesday, February 25, 2004. It was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"sequences of graphic violence\". Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and 20th Century Fox distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film. | Gibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including Fr. Jonathan Morris. During filming, assistant director Jan Michelini was struck twice by lightning. Minutes later, Jim Caviezel was also struck.[32][33][34] | Three albums were released with Mel Gibson's co-operation: (1) the film soundtrack of John Debney's original orchestral score conducted by Nick Ingman; (2) The Passion of the Christ: Songs, by producers Mark Joseph and Tim Cook, with original compositions by various artists, and (3) The Passion of the Christ: Songs Inspired By. The first two albums each received a 2005 Dove award, and the soundtrack received an Academy Award nomination of Best Original Music Score. | A preliminary score was composed and recorded by Lisa Gerrard and Patrick Cassidy, but was incomplete at film's release. Jack Lenz was the primary musical researcher and one of the composers;[35] several clips of his compositions have been posted online.[36]","m_sequel":"In June 2016, it was announced that Mel Gibson will be making a sequel to The Passion of The Christ focusing on the resurrection of Jesus Christ.[102]","m_based_on":"The Passion in the New Testament of the Bible","m_directed_by":"Mel Gibson","m_produced_by":"Bruce Davey | Mel Gibson | Stephen McEveety | Enzo Sisti","m_screenplay_by":"Mel Gibson | Benedict Fitzgerald | William Fulco (translation)","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jim Caviezel | Monica Bellucci | Claudia Gerini | Maia Morgenstern | Sergio Rubini","m_music_by":"John Debney","m_cinematography":"Caleb Deschanel","m_edited_by":"John Wright","m_production_company":"Icon Productions","m_distributed_by":"Newmarket Films | 20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"February 25, 2004 (2004-02-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"126 minutes[1] | 122 minutes (recut)[2]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"Aramaic | Latin | Hebrew","m_budget":"$30 million[3]","m_box_office":"$612 million[3] | The Passion of the Christ (sometimes referred to as The Passion[4]) is a 2004 American epic drama directed by Mel Gibson and starring Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ. It depicts the Passion of Jesus largely according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. It also draws on pious accounts such as the Friday of Sorrows along with other devotional writings, such as the reputed Marian apparitions attributed to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich.[5][6][7][8] | The film primarily covers the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, beginning with the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, the insomnia and grievance of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and ending with a brief depiction of his resurrection. Flashbacks of Jesus as a child and as a young man with Mary his mother, giving the Sermon on the Mount, teaching the Twelve Apostles, and at the Last Supper are some of the most notable images depicted. The film was shot in Italy, and the dialogue is entirely in reconstructed Aramaic, vernacular Hebrew and Latin with subtitles.[9] | The film has been controversial and received mixed to positive reviews, with some critics claiming that the extreme violence in the film \"obscures its message.\"[10][11][12][13] The film was a major commercial hit, grossing $612 million during its theatrical release.[14] The Passion of the Christ is the highest grossing religious film, the highest-grossing R-rated film in the United States,[15] and the highest grossing non-English-language film of all time.[16] It also received three nominations at the 77th Academy Awards. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"The Passion of the Christ (18)\".
