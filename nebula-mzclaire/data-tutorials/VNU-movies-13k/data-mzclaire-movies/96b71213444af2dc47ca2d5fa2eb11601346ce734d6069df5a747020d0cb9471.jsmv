Indicated by their youthful appearance and hairstyles, the film appears to have been most likely filmed sometime between 1977 and 1978.[6] | Originally released in 1980 as \"The Little Dragons\", the film was later released on VHS by Active Home Video in 1984 under the same title, but with the new tag line: \"The karate kids to the rescue!\" in order to take advantage of the popularity of the hit film The Karate Kid released that same year.[7] The film was later re-released on VHS by Magnum Video in 1991, this time retitled as \"Karate Kids U.S.A.\".[8] Subsequent DVD releases in the U.K. and the U.S. used shortened versions of both titles, retitled simply as \"Dragons\"[9] and \"Karate Kids\" using the tag line: \"Before the Karate Kid, there was The Karate Kids!\";[10] however, the most recent 2009 Music Video Distributors DVD has been released under the film's original title, \"The Little Dragons\" this time with the tag line: \"Meet the REAL Karate Kids...\".[11] | Although intended to be a \"family film\", by the time of the first VHS release in 1984, some of the language used by the children in the film was deemed inappropriate for a young audience, and was \"cleaned up\" for the 1984 Active Home Video VHS release.[12] The Petersen brothers having grown too old to re-dub their childhood voices, the decision was made to simply remove the \"offending\" dialogue altogether, resulting in the actors' mouths moving, but without the audio.[12]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Curtis Hanson","m_produced_by":"Tony Bill (executive producer) Robert S.
