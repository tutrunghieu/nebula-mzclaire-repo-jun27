M. Rathnam signed up Ajith Kumar for another film following their collaboration in Arrambam (2013) and director Gautham Menon was confirmed to direct the project.[5] Sridhar Raghavan, who wrote the script for the Bollywood film, Dum Maaro Dum (2011), was also signed by the team to assist Gautham Menon with film's script. Thiagarajan Kumararaja is also credited for the screenplay.[6] Harris Jayaraj was signed on as composer,[a] despite early speculations that A. R. Rahman would work on the film.[8] | Anirudh Ravichander had hinted about himself working in the film, but his inclusion remained unconfirmed, and ultimately proved to be untrue.[9] Australia-based cinemtographer Dan Macarthur was selected to do the film's cinematography.[10] On 29 October 2014, Suresh Chandra, Ajith's agent, confirmed the title for the film to be Yennai Arindhaal (English: Well, if you know me...).[11] The title is a play on \"Unnai Arindhaal\", a song from Vettaikaaran.[12] The title of the dubbed Telugu version was announced as Entha Vaadu Gani (English: No matter how strong the opponent is...) along with few poster designs on 23 November 2014.[13] | Anushka Shetty was signed on by the team to play one of the female leads, despite early suggestions that Pallavi Subhash had been selected for the film.[14] Prior to the official announcement of the cast, several actors were linked to portray the role of the antagonist in the film including Karthik and Prashanth.[15] Actors Aadhi, Arun Vijay and Arvind Swamy were also reported to be part of the cast, though the latter denied signing the film.[16][17] Aadhi also clarified on not acting in the film.[18] In mid-April 2014, Arun Vijay was confirmed to portray the film's antagonist and had started filming his portions.[19] | On 18 April 2014, comedian Vivek joined the cast, collaborating with Gautham Menon after the director's first venture Minnale (2001).[7] Bangalore based Amit Bhargav was selected to play the role of Anushka's beau in the film.[20] On 15 May 2014, Trisha was officially cast as another female lead of the film, collaborating with Gautham Menon for the second time after Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010).[21] Her role was later confirmed as the wife of Ajith's character.[22] Actor Thalaivasal Vijay was chosen to play a supporting role.[23] Ajith's salary was reported to be around ₹250 million (US$3.7 million) for the film.[24] Parvathy Nair was cast in a role paired opposite Arun Vijay,[25] making this film the second she signed in Tamil, after the later-released Uttama Villain.[26] Daniel Balaji played a cameo, thus becoming a part of all films in Gautham Menon's cop trilogy.[27][28] Nassar made a cameo appearance as the father of Ajith's character.[29] | Menon stated that details regarding the film would be unveiled by the end of August 2014.[30] As per his statement, Menon later said that Ajith would appear in four different looks in the film, and Anushka would portray an IT professional in the film.[31] Trisha said that her portion in the film would have a more intense love story than her last outing with Gautham Menon, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010).[32] She further said that though Ajith had been playing commercial films off late, this film would show him in a radical avatar that she herself would love to see him in.[33] It was confirmed that Ajith would be sporting black hair, a thick moustache and a slimmer look in the portions involving Baby Ankitha and Trisha, whereas he would appear in his natural grey hair style in the portions involving Anushka.[34][35] According to sources, Ajith would be seen riding a Bullet Bike in the film.[36] Stills featuring Ajith sporting a bearded look were released in early October 2014.[37] In November 2014, Vivek confirmed that his character — a police officer — would be a rather serious character with only a subtle sense of humour.[38] | A.
