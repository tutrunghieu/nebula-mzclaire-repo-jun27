He then witnesses what he believes is a kidnapping and rushes to rescue a woman named Madeleine. The \"kidnappers\" turn out to be FBI agents assigned to protect her and deliver her to a big Enron-type corruption trial in Chicago. | After the misunderstanding is cleared, Larry attempts to deliver Madeleine to the agents and get a commendation letter from them until he discovers that they're on the take and are villains who work for Arthur Grimsley, the criminal whom Madeleine is going to testify against, who also dumped her. While spending the night at a motel, Larry and Madeleine are found by the agents and escape. | During their journey, they deduce that the evidence against Arthur is contained within a disc, which is inside a safe in Arthur's mansion. After evading capture from Wilford Duvall, Arthur's head of security, they manage to keep the villains off track by faking Madeleine's death. Arriving in Chicago, Larry enters a charity polo match to get invited to a ball at Arthur's mansion. | At the ball, Larry searches for the disc while Madeleine dances with Arthur to distract him. During the search, Larry encounters and defeats Wilford in the display room of the mansion. He then bargains with one of the corrupted FBI agents to let him go, in exchange for the money in the safe. After getting the disc, Larry and Madeleine manage to escape after Arthur easily deduces her identity and holds her hostage, forcing Larry to give him the disc to save Madeleine. It is later revealed that the disc Larry gave to Arthur was a video of him singing his favorite country song. | After sending Arthur to prison, Larry is offered to join the FBI but he turns it down. He and Madeleine say goodbye and part ways. Upon returning home, Larry becomes the new town sheriff and celebrates with his girlfriend Connie.","m_cast":"Daniel Lawrence Whitney (Larry the Cable Guy) as Deputy Larry Stalder | Jenny McCarthy as Connie | Joe Mantegna as Dr. Rondog \"Doc\" Savage | Yaphet Kotto as Ricardo Bodi (alias Alonzo Mosley) | Ivana Miličević as Madeleine | Richard Bull as Sheriff Smoot | Eric Roberts as Wilford Duvall | Peter Stormare as Arthur Grimsley | J David Moeller as Elmer | Sean Bridgers as Norm","m_reception":"This film received near unanimously negative reviews from critics.
