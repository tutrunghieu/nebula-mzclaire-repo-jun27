{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Shinji Ikari, the teenage pilot of a giant Evangelion unit, is distraught over the death of his friend Kaworu Nagisa. He visits fellow pilot Asuka Langley Soryu in a hospital and masturbates to her comatose body. | The shadowy committee SEELE has discovered that commander Gendo Ikari intends to use NERV, the paramilitary organization that deploys the Evangelion units, for his own ends. SEELE dispatches the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Force (JSSDF) to seize control of NERV, killing most of the staff. NERV major Misato Katsuragi has Asuka moved to the cockpit of Evangelion Unit 02 and placed at the bottom of a lake, then rescues Shinji from JSSDF troops. Determined to have him pilot Unit 01, Misato brings Shinji to its bay doors, but is mortally wounded in the process. Before she dies, Misato implores Shinji to pilot Unit 01, gives him a French kiss, and forces him into the elevator. Arriving at the bay doors, Shinji discovers that Unit 01 is encased in JSSDF bakelite. | Meanwhile, Gendo concludes that NERV's defeat is inevitable. He retrieves the Evangelion pilot Rei Ayanami, whom he plans to use to initiate Third Impact, a cataclysmic event that will kill everyone on Earth, and reunite with his deceased wife Yui. Attempting to stop Gendo's initiation of Third Impact, NERV scientist Ritsuko Akagi uses a computer command to blow up NERV. However, Casper, a computer core modeled on Ritsuko's mother, overrides her command, and Gendo kills Ritsuko. | Inside Evangelion Unit 02, Asuka realizes her mother has \"always been with her\" and re-activates the unit. She destroys the JSSDF forces, but SEELE's new mass-produced Evangelion units dismember her and Unit 02, leaving her for dead. Unit 01 breaks free of the bakelite and ascends above NERV headquarters. From the cockpit, Shinji is mortified by the mass-produced units carrying the mutilated remains of Unit 02. | Gendo attempts to merge with Rei, who has the soul of Lilith, an angel hidden beneath the NERV headquarters, to begin Third Impact. Having merged with another angel, Adam, Gendo will become a god if he merges with Lilith. However, Rei rejects Gendo, absorbs Adam and reunites with Lilith; her body grows to gargantuan size. The mass-produced Evangelion units pull Unit 01 into the sky and crucify it, beginning the ritual to initiate Third Impact. | After several dreamlike contemplations, including a fight with Asuka, Shinji decides that he is alone and everyone in the world should die. In response, Rei/Lilith dissolves humanity back into primordial soup, reforming the souls of humanity into a single consciousness. Shinji initially accepts this new state, thinking that there could never be happiness in the real world. Realizing that life is about experiencing joy as well as pain, Shinji rejects Third Impact and Rei/Lilith deteriorates. In the aftermath, Asuka and Shinji rematerialize in an apocalyptic landscape.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"End of Evangelion won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for 1997 and the Japan Academy Prize for \"Biggest Public Sensation of the Year\"[39] and was given the \"Special Audience Choice Award\" by the 1997 Animation Kobe.[40] EX.org ranked the film in 1999 as the fifth best 'All-Time Show' (with the TV series at #2).[41] | In Japan, between its release and October 1997, The End of Evangelion grossed 1.45 billion yen.[42] Manga artist Nobuhiro Watsuki wrote: | Newtype USA reviewed the film as a \"saga of bamboozlement\". It also criticized the film's \"more biblical overtones, teen melo-drama and bad parenting\" and that \"for some frustrated viewers, these DVDs might bring on the '4th impact' hurling these DVDs against the wall.\"[44] Manga Entertainment CEO Marvin Gleicher criticized the Newtype review as \"biased and disrespectful\" and a \"facile and vapid\" product of \"ignorance and lack of research\".[45] | Many reviews focused on the audio-visual production; Sight and Sound editorialized that \"narrative coherence seems a lesser concern to the film-makers than the launching of a sustained audio-visual assault. The kaleidoscopic imagery momentarily topples into live action for the baffling climax...\",[46] an assessment echoed by critic Mark Schilling.[47] Mike Crandol of Anime News Network gave the film an overall passing grade and described it as \"a visual marvel\". He described the DVD release as \"a mixed bag\", expressing displeasure over the \"unremarkable\" video presentation and overall lack of extra material.[34] David Uzumeri of ComicsAlliance summarized the film as \"a dark, brutal, psychedelic orgy of sex and violence that culminated in the mass extinction of humanity set to an optimistic J-pop song with lyrics about suicide.\" Uzumeri also stated that the \"themes of [Neon Genesis Evangelion] criticizing the audience for being spineless and lost in a fantasy world were cranked up to eleven, as the protagonist Shinji basically watches everybody die around him due to his refusal to make any effort whatsoever to engage with other people.\"[48] | In a 2008 article for Slant Magazine, writer Michael Peterson wrote that \"it was not until the End of Evangelion film that Anno's visual strengths as a director really stood out\". He observed that \"Anno, like David Lynch, possesses a skill at framing his shots, and using the attendant color, to create visual compositions that stand out not only as beautiful in the story's context, but also as individual images, a painterly quality that he then applies back to the work. When Anno frames an image, the power of that specific image becomes a tool that he can later refer back to for an instantaneous emotional and intellectual response.\"[49] | Carlos Ross of Them Anime Reviews compared the tone of the film to The Blair Witch Project in that it deconstructed the series while \"cashing in\" on it. He was especially critical of the film's entire second half by saying: | Schilling reviewed the film as more than a deconstruction, but an attempt at unification of mediums: | \"Despite the large cast of characters, decades-spanning story, and a profusion of twenty-first-century jargon, much of it borrowed from early Christian sources, the film is essentially a Power Rangers episode writ large: i.e., super-teens piloting big, powerful machines and saving the world from monsters. We've seen it all before. What we haven't seen, however, is the way the film zaps back and forth through time, slams through narrative shifts and flashes explanatory text, in billboard-sized Chinese characters, at mind-bending speed. It's a hyper-charged phantasmagoria that defies easy comprehension, while exerting a hypnotic fascination. Watching, one becomes part of the film's multimedia data stream. Shinseiki Evangelion is looking forward, toward an integration of all popular media - television, manga, movies, and video games - into new forms in which distinctions between real and virtual, viewer and viewed, man and machine, become blurred and finally cease to matter. O Brave New World, that has such animation in it.\"[51] | Chris Beveridge of Mania.com described the film as \"work[ing] on so many levels\", but cautions that it is not meant to be watched without having seen the rest of the series.[52] | The End of Evangelion is frequently ranked among the greatest anime films. Patrick Macias of TokyoScope ranked it one of his 10 greatest films,[53] and the best anime movie of the 1990s;[54] CUT film magazine ranked it third on its list of the top 30 best anime films.[55] | In 2014, Time Out New York ranked the film at #65 on its list of the top 100 animated movies as voted for by filmmakers.[3] Critic Keith Uhlich described the film as an \"immensely satisfying\" conclusion to the TV series, the climax as \"an end-times free-for-all that mixes Christian symbology, Jewish mysticism, sexual paranoia and teenage angst into a searing apocalyptic stew,\" filled with \"sights and sounds you'll never forget,\" and Shinji's line, \"I'm so fucked up,\" as the most memorable quote.[3]","m_production":"The ambiguous meaning of the TV series' ending left many viewers and critics confused and unsatisfied.[5] The final two episodes were possibly the most controversial segments of an already controversial series[6] and were received as flawed and incomplete by many.[7] However, Anno and assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki defended the artistic integrity of the finale.[8][9] | Gainax launched the project to create a film ending for the series in 1997, first releasing Death & Rebirth as a highly condensed character-based recap and re-edit of the TV series (Death) and the first half of the new ending (Rebirth, which was originally intended to be the full ending, but could not be finished due to budget and time constraints). The project was completed later in the year and released as The End of Evangelion. Episode 25': Air uses the original script intended for episode 25 of the original series[citation needed] and forms roughly 2/3 of the previous film, Rebirth. | Ritsuko's voice actress Yuriko Yamaguchi had considerable difficulty delivering her character Ritsuko's response to Gendo Ikari without knowing what Gendo had said (as Anno ensured that part of Gendo's line was inaudible). She successfully delivered the line after being shown a hint from Anno.[10] | Among the images used in the film are of some of the hate-mail and death threats (including graffiti on Gainax's headquarters) as well as letters of praise sent to Anno.[11][12]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Hideaki Anno Kazuya Tsurumaki","m_produced_by":"Mitsuhisa Ishikawa","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Megumi Ogata Megumi Hayashibara Yuko Miyamura Kotono Mitsuishi","m_music_by":"Shiro Sagisu","m_cinematography":"Hisao Shirai","m_edited_by":"Sachiko Miki","m_production_company":"Production I.G Gainax","m_distributed_by":"Toei Company","m_release_dates":"July 19, 1997 (1997-07-19) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"Japanese | The End of Evangelion (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン劇場版 Air(エア)/まごころを、君に, Shin Seiki Evangerion Gekijō-ban: Ea/Magokoro o, Kimi ni?) is a 1997 Japanese animated and live action science fiction film written and directed by Hideaki Anno, animated by Production I.G, released as a finale for the mecha-based television series Neon Genesis Evangelion. | The film is divided into two episodes: Episode 25': Air / Love is Destructive and Episode 26': My Purest Heart for You, Sincerely Yours / ONE MORE FINAL: I need you.
