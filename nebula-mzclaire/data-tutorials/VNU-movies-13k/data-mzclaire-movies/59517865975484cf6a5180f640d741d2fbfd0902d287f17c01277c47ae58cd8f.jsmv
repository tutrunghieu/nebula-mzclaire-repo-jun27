{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Francesca Cunningham (Ann Todd) is a silent, suicidal mental patient under the care of Dr. Larsen (Herbert Lom). Via hypnosis, Larsen leads her to describe her life history so he can investigate the events that brought her to attempt suicide. The film largely consists of a series of flashbacks in which Francesca talks about her life, removing successive \"veils\" to recover memories. | Only her second cousin and guardian, Nicholas (James Mason), a crippled musician, is interested in her. Nicholas, though, is a bitter man, faintly jealous of her talent and very misogynistic because of his relationship with his mother. However, he is a brilliant music teacher who encourages Francesca to excel, but also to avoid all emotional entanglements. At the Royal College of Music, Peter (Hugh McDermott), an American studying in London, becomes romantically interested in Francesca. Although she is initially unresponsive, Francesca and Peter become engaged, but she has not yet reached her majority (then 21) and Nicholas withholds his consent. He insists they leave for Paris in the morning; she completes her education, and begins her career on the continent. | Years pass. Nicholas and Francesca return to Britain when she is invited to perform at the Royal Albert Hall, but she discovers Peter has married someone else. An artist, Maxwell Leyden (Albert Lieven), is invited by Nicholas to paint her portrait; they soon fall in love and agree to live together. Still apparently her guardian, Nicholas becomes angry at the news and strikes her hands with his cane while she plays. She flees from him, but while with Max, is involved in a serious car accident and suffers burns to her hands. Francesca becomes convinced she will never play again. | After therapy — and now cured, according to Dr Larsen — Francesca finds that Nicholas is her real love rather than Peter (now divorced) or Max.","m_cast":"James Mason as Nicholas | Ann Todd as Francesca | Herbert Lom as Dr. Larsen | Hugh McDermott as Peter Gay | Albert Lieven as Maxwell Leyden | Yvonne Owen as Susan Brook | David Horne as Dr. Kendall | Manning Whiley as Dr. Irving | Grace Allardyce as Nurse | Ernest Davies as Parker | John Slater as James","m_reception":"Filmed on a relatively low budget of under £100,000,[4] the film was the biggest British box-office success of its year.
