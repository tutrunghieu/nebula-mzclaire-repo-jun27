{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film follows Kaspar Hauser (Bruno Schleinstein), who lived the first seventeen years of his life chained in a tiny cellar with only a toy horse to occupy his time, devoid of all human contact except for a man, wearing a black overcoat and top hat, who feeds him. | One day, in 1828, the same man takes Hauser out of his cell, teaches him a few phrases, and how to walk, before leaving him in the town of Nuremberg. Hauser becomes the subject of much curiosity, and is exhibited in a circus before being rescued by Professor Georg Friedrich Daumer (Walter Ladengast), who patiently attempts to transform him. | Hauser soon learns to read and write, and develops unorthodox approaches to logic and religion; but music is what pleases him most. He attracts the attention of academics, clergy and nobility, but is then physically attacked by the same unknown man who brought him to Nuremberg. The attack leaves him unconscious with a bleeding head. He recovers, but is again mysteriously attacked; this time, stabbed in the chest. | Hauser rests in bed describing visions he has had of nomadic Berbers in the Sahara Desert, and then dies. An autopsy reveals an enlarged liver and cerebellum.","m_cast":"The casting and character names are based on the submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.[2]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Herzog has been quoted as saying that the title (German: Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle) for the film was inspired by a sentence in the novel Macunaíma by Brazilian writer Mário de Andrade.[5] | The film follows the real story of Kaspar Hauser quite closely, using the text of actual letters found with Hauser, and following many details in the opening sequence of Hauser's confinement and release. The characters of Professor Daumer and of Lord Stanhope are also based on historical figures, Georg Friedrich Daumer and Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope, respectively. | An English language translation of the screenplay was published in 1980.[6] | Herzog discovered the lead actor, Bruno Schleinstein, in a documentary about street musicians Bruno der Schwarze, es blies ein Jäger wohl in sein Horn (lit. Bruno the Black One, A Hunter Blows his Horn).[7] Fascinated, Herzog cast him as the lead for The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser despite the fact that he had no training as an actor. Further, the historical Hauser was 17 when he was discovered in Nuremberg and the film implies this. Schleinstein was 41 years old at the time of filming, although his character is treated and described throughout as a youth. Schleinstein's own life bore some similarities to Kaspar Hauser's, and his own unbalanced personality was often expressed on set. In Herzog's commentary for the English language DVD release, he recalls that Schleinstein remained in costume for the entire duration of the production, even after shooting was done for the day. Herzog once visited him in his hotel room, to find him sleeping on the floor by the door, in his costume.[8] Schleinstein was credited only as \"Bruno S.\" in the film. Herzog subsequently wrote Schleinstein into the screenplay for a second film, Stroszek (1977). | The Production Designer for the film was Henning Von Gierke, the Costume Designers were Ann Poppel and Gisela Storch.[1] | The outdoor scenes were filmed in the town of Dinkelsbühl and on a nearby mountain called Hesselberg. | Croagh Patrick, Westport, Mayo, Ireland (archive footage) | Dinkelsbühl, Bavaria, Germany | Western Sahara | The music of several classical composers is featured in the film's soundtrack, including pieces by Johann Pachelbel, Orlande de Lassus, Tomaso Albinoni, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Werner Herzog","m_produced_by":"Werner Herzog","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Bruno S.

The irony of the piece, in and out, is that as Kaspar gradually becomes more articulate and less of an \"enigma,\" the intense curiosity about him and his \"creation\" almost certainly leads to his downfall. Embedded therein is the idea that a dissection of art leads, inevitably, to the deconstruction of what is, at its essence, ineffable and indefinable. The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser is a strange, brave performance housed in an anti-linear film stuffed with obscure images and silent passages of profound, frightening insight.  | ^ Ebert, Roger (November 2007). \"The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser\".  | ^ Herzog: The Collection - LImited Edition (Blu-ray).
