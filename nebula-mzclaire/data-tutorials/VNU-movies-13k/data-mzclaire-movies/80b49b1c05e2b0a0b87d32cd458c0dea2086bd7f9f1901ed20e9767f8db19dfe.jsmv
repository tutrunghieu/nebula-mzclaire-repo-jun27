{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Picking up after the events of the original film, the people of the small town of Newt, Texas, led by the corrupt Mayor Burt Hartman (Paul Rae), burn down the farmhouse of the Sawyer family for their role in aiding Jedidiah \"Jed\" Sawyer (Dan Yeager), also known as \"Leatherface\", in several murders. The arsonists are celebrated as heroes in the community, and the entire family is presumed dead. However, an infant, Edith Sawyer, is found by one of the townsmen, Gavin Miller (David Born), who quickly murders her mother, Loretta Sawyer (Dodie Brown), and adopts Edith with his wife Arlene (Sue Rock). Twenty eight years later, Edith has been raised by Gavin and Arlene as Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario). One day, Heather is notified that her estranged grandmother, Verna Carson (Marilyn Burns), has passed away and left everything to her. Discovering that she was adopted, Heather, her boyfriend Ryan (Trey Songz), and two other friends, Nikki (Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (Keram Malicki-Sánchez), travel to Newt to collect her inheritance. Along the way, the group picks up a hitchhiker named Darryl (Shaun Sipos). | When they arrive, the Sawyer family attorney, Farnsworth (Richard Riehle), gives her the keys to the family house along with a letter from Verna. Excited about the property she now owns, Heather and her friends look through the house, decide to stay the night, and immediately set off to buy supplies and food, trusting Darryl to stay behind and look after the house. Darryl begins looting it and believes he will find valuables in a locked room in the cellar; however, upon entering the locked room he is bludgeoned by Leatherface. Heather and her friends return and discover the house has been ransacked, but choose to let it go. As Kenny prepares dinner he finds the cellar, where Darryl was killed, and Leatherface impales him on a meat hook. Nikki tricks Ryan into having sex with her in the barn. While searching through a room upstairs, Heather finds a decomposing body upstairs and runs to find her friends, but she is knocked unconscious by Leatherface. She wakes up in Leatherface's room where she manages to escape to the graveyard while Leatherface cuts Kenny in half with a chainsaw. Hearing the screams and chainsaw, Ryan and Nikki come out the barn to find Leatherface. Nikki draws his attention to them, and they run in the barn to hide. As he goes after them, Heather gets free, gets their van and saves her friends. | In the ensuing chase, Leatherface saws through one of the van's tires, causing it to crash and subsequently kill Ryan. Heather escapes and makes her way into a carnival, but Leatherface escapes the police as they patrol the grounds. Sheriff Hooper (Thom Barry) realizes that Leatherface survived the fire and is still alive; Mayor Hartman sends Officer Marvin (James MacDonald) to the Sawyer house to kill Leatherface against Hooper's orders. While looking for Leatherface, Marvin is startled by Nikki and accidentally shoots her, before being killed by Leatherface himself. While at the station, Heather learns of what the townspeople did to her family and flees. She is soon caught by Hartman's son, Deputy Carl Hartman (Scott Eastwood), who ties her up, gags her at the long-abandoned Sawyer slaughterhouse. When he arrives Leatherface finds out that Heather is his cousin and frees her, but is attacked by Mayor Hartman and Ollie (Ritchie Montgomery), the town barber and accomplice to the Sawyer house arson. At first Heather begins to flee, but after hearing her cousin being beaten she decides to help him, killing Ollie with a pitchfork and giving Leatherface his chainsaw, which he uses to force Mayor Hartman into a meat-grinder. Afterward, Heather and Leatherface return home, where Heather reads the letter from Verna which tells her Leatherface will protect her as long as she takes care of him. Realizing Leatherface is the only family she has left, Heather decides to stay with him. | In a post-credits scene, Gavin and Arlene show up at the mansion to visit Heather, intending on greedily splitting her assets. As they wait in front of the door, Leatherface answers with his chainsaw in hand.","m_cast":"Alexandra Daddario as Heather Miller: The film follows Heather, who is travelling through Texas with her boyfriend Ryan to collect an inheritance.[4][5] | Dan Yeager as Leatherface: Luessenhop stated that he picked Yeager because he felt a sense of \"menace\" after witnessing Yeager's 6'6\" frame, \"farm boy arms\", and \"brooding brow\" stand \"quiet and circumspect\".

According to Variety writer Michael Fleming, the plan was to create a contemporary film in 3-D, with Stephen Susco writing the script. The contract, with rights-holders Bob Kuhn and Kim Henkel, would be for multiple films.[10] In May 2011, Lions Gate announced that it would be partnering with Nu Image to produce the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and that John Luessenhop would direct the film. Mazzocone will act as producer, with production having been set to begin in June 2011. Mazzocone also announced that the story would pick up where Tobe Hooper's original film ends.[11] Adam Marcus and Debra Sullivan were brought in to write the script; Kirsten Elms and Luessenhop worked on rewrites and script polishing.[12] Neither Twisted Pictures nor Nu Image had a credit on the finished film, which had to be re-cut before release, as it received an NC-17 rating due to excessive gore during its initial submission to the MPAA.[13]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters created  by Kim Henkel Tobe Hooper","m_directed_by":"John Luessenhop","m_produced_by":"Carl Mazzocone","m_screenplay_by":"Adam Marcus Debra Sullivan Kirsten Elms","m_story_by":"Stephen Susco Adam Marcus Debra Sullivan","m_starring":"Alexandra Daddario Dan Yeager Trey Songz Scott Eastwood Tania Raymonde Thom Barry Paul Rae Bill Moseley Gunnar Hansen","m_music_by":"John Frizzell","m_cinematography":"Anastas N.
