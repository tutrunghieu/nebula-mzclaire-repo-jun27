Harry (Daniel Auteuil), a divorced businessman who feels alienated from his children, meets Georges (Pascal Duquenne), an institutionalised man with Down's syndrome, after Georges has escaped from his mental institution and is nearly run over by Harry. The film was selected as the Belgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 69th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[1][2] | The film was written and directed by Jaco Van Dormael. Some scenes in the film appear as dream sequences, often employing magical realism. The music of Luis Mariano (\"Mexico,\" and \"Maman, Tu Es La Plus Belle Du Monde\") is used in these scenes, with actor Laszlo Harmati playing Mariano, who died in 1970. The original music score is from Pierre Van Dormael, Jaco's brother. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | ^ \"39 Countries Hoping for Oscar Nominations\".
