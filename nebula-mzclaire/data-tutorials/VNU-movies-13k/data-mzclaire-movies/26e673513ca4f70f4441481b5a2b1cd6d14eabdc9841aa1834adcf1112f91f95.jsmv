It later went on to make about $8,166,000 worldwide in rentals.[7] | It currently holds an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7.2 out of 10 stars on IMDB. | Bosley Crowther at The New York Times felt the film was, \"not a strong and soaring drama but an illustrated lecture on a slow artist at work.\" He sympathized with the Pope and his mounting impatience with Michelangelo, criticizing Heston's acting as lacking any warmth to endear him to the audience. Furthermore, he believed the script suffered from being \"wordy.\" [8] | In a 2013 retrospective review in The Guardian, Alex von Tunzelmann noted that the film's \"intent to inform is laudable, but a fictional film should really be able to convey its subject without a lecture,\" and echoed Crowther's observation that \"the screenplay goes heavy on the dialogue, light on the action.\" She concluded the film would have been more interesting \"if it were told with a lot more humour and a lot less prudishness.\" [9] | James Plath of Movie Metropolis was more positive, saying that \"For some viewers, the agony will be watching Charlton Heston (over)act, and the ecstasy Rex Harrison. But it IS refreshing for a period film to cover such new and (pun intended) artistic ground.\"[10]","m_production":"The film's production schedule ran from June 8th, 1964 to September, 1964. [4] | Philip Dunne wrote the screenplay for the film in 1959, around the time the original book by Irving Stone was published. The movie was originally supposed to have been filmed in 1961, directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Burt Lancaster, but production was delayed for three years. Laurence Olivier was supposedly the first choice for Pope Julius II, but was unavailable. Spencer Tracy was then offered the role of the Pope before Rex Harrison was cast. When it came time to film the feature, the Sistine Chapel could not be used and so it was recreated on a sound stage at Cinecittà Studios, Rome, Italy. During the production, Rex Harrison and Charlton Heston did not get along. Twelve years later, while filming The Prince and the Pauper, Harrison avoided Heston completely.[5] | According to his diary, Heston was interested in playing Michelangelo before any studios decided to produce the movie. Once cast in the part, he was excited to act under Reed, who had directed The Third Man (1949). Heston felt that this would be the movie to resurrect Reed's directorial reputation, describing it as having the best audience-preview responses than any film he had ever seen. However, it only did modest business at the box office.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone","m_directed_by":"Carol Reed","m_produced_by":"Carol Reed","m_screenplay_by":"Philip Dunne","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Charlton Heston Rex Harrison Diane Cilento Harry Andrews Alberto Lupo","m_music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith Alex North","m_cinematography":"Leon Shamroy","m_edited_by":"Samuel E.
