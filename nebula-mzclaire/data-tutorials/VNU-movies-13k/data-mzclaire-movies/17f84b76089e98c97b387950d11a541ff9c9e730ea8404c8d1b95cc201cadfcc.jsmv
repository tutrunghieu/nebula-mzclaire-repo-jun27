{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"At a Detroit theater showing kung fu films, Alabama Whiteman strikes up a conversation with Elvis Presley fanatic Clarence Worley. The two later have sex at Clarence's apartment in downtown Detroit. Alabama tearfully confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarence's boss as a birthday present, but has fallen in love with Clarence. They later marry. | An apparition of Elvis appears to Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabama's pimp Drexl. Clarence goes to the brothel where Alabama had worked, shoots and kills Drexl, and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabama's belongings. Back at the apartment, he and Alabama discover the bag contains a large amount of cocaine. | The couple visit Clarence's estranged father, Clifford, a former cop and now a security guard, for help. Clifford tells Clarence that the police assume Drexl's murder to be a gang killing. After the couple leave for Los Angeles, Clifford is interrogated by Don Vincenzo Coccotti, consigliere to a mobster named \"Blue Lou Boyle\", who wants the drugs. Clifford, realizing he will die anyway, mockingly defies Coccotti, whereupon Coccotti angrily shoots Clifford dead. A note on the refrigerator leads the mobsters to Clarence's L.A. address. | In L.A., Clarence and Alabama meet Clarence's old friend Dick, an aspiring actor. Dick introduces Clarence to a friend of his, actor Elliot Blitzer, who reluctantly agrees to broker the sale of the drugs to film producer Lee Donowitz. | While Clarence is out buying lunch, Coccotti's underboss, Virgil, finds Alabama in her motel room and beats her for information. She fights back and kills him with his shotgun. Elliot is pulled over for speeding and arrested for drug possession. In order to stay out of jail, he agrees to record the drug deal between Clarence and Donowitz for the police. Coccotti's crew learn where the deal will take place from Dick's roommate Floyd. | Clarence, Alabama, Dick, and Elliot go to Donowitz's suite at the Ambassador Hotel with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious Clarence threatens Elliot at gunpoint, but is persuaded by Elliott's helpless pleading. | Clarence fabricates a story for Donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt cop, and Donowitz agrees to the sale. Clarence excuses himself to the bathroom, where a vision of Elvis again appears and reassures him that things are going well. | Meanwhile, Donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the cops and mobsters and a shootout begins after Elliott accidentally reveals himself as an informant. Dick abandons the drugs and flees. Almost everyone is killed in the gun battle, and Clarence is wounded as he exits the bathroom. He and Alabama escape with Donowitz's money as more police arrive. They flee to Mexico where Alabama gives birth to a son, whom she names Elvis.","m_cast":"Christian Slater as Clarence Worley | Patricia Arquette as Alabama Whitman | Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie | Bronson Pinchot as Elliot Blitzer | Saul Rubinek as Lee Donowitz | Dennis Hopper as Clifford Worley | James Gandolfini as Virgil | Gary Oldman as Drexl Spivey | Christopher Walken as Don Vincenzo Coccotti | Chris Penn as Detective Nicky Dimes | Tom Sizemore as Detective Cody Nicholson | Michael Beach as Officer Wurlitzer | Brad Pitt as Floyd | Val Kilmer as \"Mentor\" (Elvis Presley) | Samuel L.

Released after Reservoir Dogs, it was his first screenplay for a major motion picture, and Tarantino contends that it is his most autobiographical film to date. He had hoped to also direct the film, but lost interest in directing and sold the script. According to Tarantino's audio commentary on the DVD release, he was happy with the way it turned out. Apart from changing the nonlinear narrative he wrote to a more conventional linear structure, it was largely faithful to his original screenplay. He initially opposed director Tony Scott's decision to change the ending (which Scott maintained was of his own volition, not the studio's, saying \"I just fell in love with these two characters and didn’t want to see them die\"). When seeing the completed film, he realized Scott's happy ending was more appropriate to the film as Scott directed it.[5] The film's first act, as well as some fragments of dialogue, were repurposed from Tarantino's 1987 amateur film My Best Friend's Birthday. | The film's score by Hans Zimmer is a theme based on Gassenhauer from Carl Orff's Schulwerk. This theme combined with a voiceover spoken by Arquette is an homage to Terrence Malick's 1973 crime film Badlands, in which Sissy Spacek speaks the voiceover, and that also shares similar dramatic motifs.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tony Scott","m_produced_by":"Gary Barber Samuel Hadida James G.
