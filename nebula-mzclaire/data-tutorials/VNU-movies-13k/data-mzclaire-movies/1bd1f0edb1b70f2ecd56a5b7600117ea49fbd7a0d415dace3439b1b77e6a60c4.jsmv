{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Professor Julius Kelp is a nerdy, scruffy, buck-toothed, accident-prone, socially awkward university professor whose experiments in the classroom laboratory are unsuccessful and highly destructive. When a football-playing bully embarrasses and attacks him, Kelp decides to \"beef up\" by joining a local gym. Kelp's lack of physical strength prompts him to invent a serum that turns him into the handsome, suave, charming, and cheeky girl-chasing hipster, Buddy Love. | This new persona gives him the self-confidence to pursue one of his students, Stella Purdy. Although she resents Love, she finds herself strangely attracted to him. Buddy wows the crowd with his jazzy, breezy musical delivery and poised demeanor at the Purple Pit, a nightclub where the students hang out. He also mocks a bartender and waitress and punches a student. The formula wears off at inopportune times, often to Kelp's humiliation. | Although Kelp knows that his alternate persona is a bad person, he cannot prevent himself from continually taking the formula as he enjoys the attention that Love receives. As Buddy performs at the annual student dance the formula starts to wear off. His real identity now revealed, Kelp gives an impassioned speech, admitting his mistakes and seeking forgiveness. Kelp says that the one thing he learned from being someone else is that if you don't like yourself, you can't expect others to like you. Purdy meets Kelp backstage, and confesses that she prefers Kelp over Buddy Love. | Eventually, Kelp's formerly timid father chooses to market the formula (a copy of which Kelp had sent to his parents' home for safekeeping), endorsed by the deadpan president of the university who proclaims, \"It's a gasser!\" Kelp's father makes a pitch to the chemistry class, and the students all rush forward to buy the new tonic. In the confusion Kelp and Purdy slip out of the class. Armed with a marriage license and two bottles of the formula, they elope. | During the short closing credits, each of the characters come out and bow down to the camera, and when Jerry Lewis, still portraying Kelp, comes out and bows, he trips and goes into the camera, breaking it and causing the picture to go black.","m_cast":"Jerry Lewis as Professor Julius F.

Paramount was the copyright holder of the theme from its original appearance in The Uninvited (1944). | Love instructs the bartender to make an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater, \"mix it nice\" and pour it into a tall glass. The bartender asks if he can take a sip; after doing so, he freezes like a statue. While the drink started as fictional, it is now listed on some cocktail websites.[4][5][6] | The basic characterization of Julius Kelp was a Lewis staple, having appeared earlier in 1958's Rock-A-Bye Baby, and basically identical characters would appear in 1965's The Family Jewels, and 1967's The Big Mouth. | Buddy Love is often interpreted as a lampoon of Lewis' former show business partner Dean Martin. Lewis, however, has consistently denied this, saying that the character of Love was based on every obnoxious self-important hateful hipster he ever knew, including in his 1982 autobiography, and in a special documentary produced for the DVD release of the film, entitled The Nutty Professor, Making The Formula. On the DVD commentary Lewis speculates that he perhaps should have made Love more evil — since to his surprise more fan mail came for Love than the professor. Film critic Danny Peary has made the claim in his 1981 book Cult Movies that the character of Love is actually the real counterpart of Jerry Lewis. Lewis has stated that the two represented good and evil.[7] | The character of Professor Frink from the animated television series The Simpsons loosely borrows much of his mannerisms and technique from Lewis's delivery of the Julius Kelp character, as well as the transition to a \"Buddy Love\" version of Frink in several episodes. In one episode, the character of Frink's father appears, and was voiced by guest star Lewis. | The DVD of the film contains a long deleted scene in which Kelp's love interest is portrayed as a sultry siren whose choreographed, jaw-dropping entrance to the Purple Pit, accompanied by jazz music, is quite a contrast to the final edit in which she is portrayed as smart but fairly unassuming.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  by Robert Louis Stevenson","m_directed_by":"Jerry Lewis","m_produced_by":"Ernest D.
