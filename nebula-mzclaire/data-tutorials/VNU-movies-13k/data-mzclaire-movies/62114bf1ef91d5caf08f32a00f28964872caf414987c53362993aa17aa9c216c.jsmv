On November 28, 1978, Robert Redford was announced to star in the film,[3] becoming the fifth film in which Sydney Pollack directed Redford following This Property Is Condemned (1966), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Way We Were (1973) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). This director-actor relationship would continue with two more films: Out of Africa (1985) and Havana (1990). Pollack had also previously directed Fonda in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), whereas Redford and Fonda previously teamed on The Chase (1966) and Barefoot in the Park (1967). | The Electric Horseman is noted as being the debut acting performance of long-time country and western singer Willie Nelson, who plays the role of Wendell Hickson. According to Pollack, Nelson improvised most of his dialogue in the film. Pollack would later be executive producer for Nelson's 1980 starring vehicle Honeysuckle Rose. The film was also only the second film performance of character actor Wilford Brimley, who would later team with Redford in The Natural (1984). | \"For Electric Horseman, I literally ended up writing half of every night before we would shoot. We make jokes now about my saying, 'Let's pick the longest location cause I have time to write the scene by the time we get there.' And that's literally true. There were yellow pads all over the place; we're writing out to work in the morning.\" | Principal photography for The Electric Horseman took place during late 1978 and early 1979 throughout Nevada and Utah. While the film was prominently shot on location in Las Vegas and Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area,[5][6] additional filming took place in various locations across the state of Utah, including Grafton, St. George, and Zion National Park.[7][8] | While filming generally went smoothly, Pollack struggled with revising the script while filming was underway.[4] In addition, there was one particular day in which production was continuously delayed due to traveling thunderstorms that interrupted the 20-second kissing scene between Redford and Fonda. Ultimately, the scene ended up requiring 48 takes that pushed costs to $280,000.[9] The film went over budget by $1.3 million, elevating it to $12.5 million.[1] | The musical score to The Electric Horseman was composed by Dave Grusin. In addition to co-starring, Willie Nelson contributed significantly to the film's soundtrack as well, singing five songs including \"My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys\", \"Midnight Rider,\" \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,\" \"So You Think You're a Cowboy\" and \"Hands on the Wheel.\" Coinciding with the film's release, a soundtrack album was released featuring both Nelson's songs and Grusin's score.[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Sydney Pollack","m_produced_by":"Ray Stark","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":"Shelly Burton","m_starring":"Robert Redford Jane Fonda Valerie Perrine John Saxon Willie Nelson","m_music_by":"Dave Grusin","m_cinematography":"Owen Roizman","m_edited_by":"Sheldon Kahn","m_production_company":"Rastar Films","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 21, 1979 (1979-12-21) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"120 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$12.5 million[1]","m_box_office":"$61.8 million[2] | The Electric Horseman is a 1979 adventure-romance film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda and directed by Sydney Pollack.
