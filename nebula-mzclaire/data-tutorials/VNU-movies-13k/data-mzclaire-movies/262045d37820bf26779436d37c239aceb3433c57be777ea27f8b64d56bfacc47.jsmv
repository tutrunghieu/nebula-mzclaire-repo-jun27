Workers of all three are hindered by sub-standard equipment, hazardous waste, and a lack of safety precautions. Perhaps even worse, the declining need for heavy industry results in a constant shortage of raw materials, leaving the workers idle and concerned for their future. | The second part, \"Remnants\" follows the families of many of the workers in an old state-run housing block, \"Rainbow Row.\" In particular, Wang focuses on the teenage children who concern themselves with their own lives but must also cope with their inevitable displacement as Tie Xi's factories continue to close down. | The third part, \"Rails\" narrows its focus to a single father and son who scavenge the rail yards in order to sell raw parts to the factories. With the factories closing however, their future suddenly becomes uncertain.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"According to They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, a website which aggregates critics' reviews, Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks is the 15th most acclaimed film of the 21st century.[2] In a 2012 poll by the British Film Institute, seven critics named it one of the 10 greatest films ever made.[3]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Wang Bing","m_produced_by":"Wang Bing Zhu Zhu","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Wang Bing","m_edited_by":"Wang Bing Adam Kerdy","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"2003","m_running_time":"551 min.","m_country":"China","m_language":"Mandarin Chinese | Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks is a 2003 Chinese documentary film by Wang Bing.
