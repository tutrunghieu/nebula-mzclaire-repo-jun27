After they have begun their romance, they return home to Sean's house one afternoon to find his estranged wife Moira (Saffron Burrows) waiting for them. Marcy leaves Sean, upset that he did not disclose his marriage to her. | McGlory and Nick arrive in Ballinagra, although Marcy's been unable to locate any McGlory relatives.
