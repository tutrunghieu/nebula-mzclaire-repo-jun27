{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Wayne and Garth now broadcast their Friday-night TV show from an abandoned factory in Aurora. After an Aerosmith concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets Jim Morrison (Michael A. Nickles) and a \"weird naked Indian\" (Larry Sellers). Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize and put on a big concert. Wayne and Garth dub the concert \"Waynestock\" and get to work by hiring Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston (Ralph Brown).They find that their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fall flat, and Wayne wonders if the whole thing was a good idea. | Meanwhile Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra has a new producer, Bobby Cahn (Christopher Walken), who slowly tries to pull her away from Wayne and Illinois. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks off the relationship and hastily gets engaged to Bobby on the rebound. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornée (Kim Basinger), at the laundromat, who attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband. Garth eventually bails on the relationship. | Tickets are sold for Waynestock but no bands show up. Wayne departs the festival grounds so he can find Cassandra, leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check. Wayne travels to a church and breaks up Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her. Meanwhile, Garth has stage fright during the concert. Upon returning to Waynestock, the bands still have not shown up. As in the first film, three endings occur. | Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who said that no one will come, telling them that all that matters is they tried. They turn around to go back to Waynestock and they lose their way, not knowing how to escape the desert dream sequence, and therefore presumably die of thirst (the sad ending). | They drive their car to find the bands, but a helicopter corners them, so they drive their car off a cliff (the Thelma & Louise ending). | The promised bands arrive and the whole event is a huge success (the happy ending). | During the middle of the end credits, after the concert is over and everyone has left, the weird naked Indian stands crying because the whole park is trashed (in a parody of the 1971 \"Keep America Beautiful\" \"Crying Indian\" campaign). Wayne and Garth tell him not to cry, they were planning on cleaning up all the trash. Wayne and Garth begin cleaning up the large park while the weird naked Indian watches. | Waynestock is held in Adlai Stevenson Memorial Park, in Aurora, Illinois. The acts that Wayne books include Crucial Taunt (Tia Carrere and band), Aerosmith, Rip Taylor, Pearl Jam, and Van Halen (the latter two do not actually appear in the film). Aerosmith performs \"Shut Up and Dance\" at the concert. Additionally, the Gin Blossoms and Nash Kato (of Urge Overkill) can be seen being escorted out of a limousine-length Mirthmobile (a stretched AMC Pacer) by the weird naked Indian as the closing credits begin.","m_cast":"Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell | Dana Carvey as Garth Algar | Tia Carrere as Cassandra Wong | Christopher Walken as Robert G. \"Bobby\" Cahn | Kevin Pollak as Jerry Segel | Ralph Brown as Del Preston | James Hong as Jeff Wong, Cassandra's father and martial arts expert | Kim Basinger as Honey Hornée | Jim Downey as the dubbed voice of Jeff Wong | Chris Farley as Milton, an aimless friend of Wayne and Garth's | Ed O'Neill as Glen | Michael A.

Its final North American gross was $48 million, slightly more than its $40 million production budget, but much less than the original film's gross of over $100 million. During its release, Wayne's World 2 also suffered severely due to competition from other holiday season blockbusters such as Mrs. Doubtfire, Schindler's List, and The Pelican Brief.[5]","m_production":"Penelope Spheeris, who directed the first film, was approached by Paramount to direct the sequel, but she declined immediately due to having problems with Myers during the making of the first film.

It wasn't until the release of the first Austin Powers film that Spheeris finally made peace with Myers.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Wayne's World  by Mike Myers","m_directed_by":"Stephen Surjik","m_produced_by":"Lorne Michaels","m_screenplay_by":"Mike Myers Bonnie Turner Terry Turner","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mike Myers | Dana Carvey | Christopher Walken | Tia Carrere | Ralph Brown | Aerosmith","m_music_by":"Carter Burwell","m_cinematography":"Francis Kenny","m_edited_by":"Malcolm Campbell","m_production_company":"NBC Films","m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 10, 1993 (1993-12-10) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"95 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$40 million","m_box_office":"$48.2 million[1] | Wayne's World 2 is a 1993 American comedy film starring Mike Myers and Dana Carvey as hosts of a public-access television cable TV show in Aurora, Illinois.
