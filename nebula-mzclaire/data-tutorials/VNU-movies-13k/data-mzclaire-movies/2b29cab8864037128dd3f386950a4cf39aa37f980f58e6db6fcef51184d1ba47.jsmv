{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Wing Chun is a talented kung fu practitioner who lives in a mountain village with her father, sister, and aunt. Out of all the villagers, she is the only person who will stand up to the local bandits, led by two nefarious brothers. One day, a young and beautiful widow Charmy comes to town, catching the attention of the bandit chief Flying Monkey. Wing Chun rescues the hapless widow and gives her a job in her family's tofu shop, earning the enmity of Flying Monkey and his brother Flying Chimpanzee. Meanwhile, Leung Pok To arrives in town, fresh from studying kung fu. He is Wing Chun's childhood friend and has returned to claim her hand in marriage. He at first mistakes Charmy for Wing Chun and she encourages the mistake, believing he will not care for her in her current masculine, kung fu fighting avatar. Charmy is enamored with the handsome stranger, but Pok To is disappointed to find that his Wing Chun has changed. When Flying Monkey kidnaps Charmy, he uses her for bait, luring Wing Chun to a battle in the bandit's mountain fortress. She rescues Wing Chun, but is unable to completely defeat Flying Chimpanzee so she seeks help from her master. Pok To discovers her deception and when she realizes that he doesn't mind that she is a kung fu fighter, she agrees that she will marry him if she can defeat Flying Chimpanzee. Using her master's advice, she defeats Flying Chimpanzee in a final showdown and marries her childhood sweetheart.","m_cast":"Michelle Yeoh as Yim Wing-chun | Donnie Yen as Leung Pok-to | Kingdom Yuen as Abacus Fong | Catherine Hung as Charmy | Waise Lee as Scholar Wong | Norman Chu as Flying Chimpanzee | Chui Ah-Fai as Flying Monkey | Cheng Pei-pei as Wing Chun's martial arts master, Mistress Wu Mei","m_reception":"Joey O'Bryan of the Austin Chronicle called it a \"fun, period martial arts film, unique in its stylistic approach to both violence and sexual politics\".[4] J.
