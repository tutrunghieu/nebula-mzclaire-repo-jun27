{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Son of a notorious fast drawing Sheriff, George Kelby Jr. (Glenn Ford) and his wife Dora (Jeanne Crain) settle down in the peaceful town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive.\" Now known as George Temple, he becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper, little respected by the other townsfolk. | One day comes news that outlaw Vinnie Harold (Broderick Crawford) has gunned down Clint Fallon (Walter Coy, reputedly the \"fastest draw in the west.\" George listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk.\" | His pride stung, George retrieves a gun from hiding (he told his wife he'd tossed it into the river years ago) and—over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built—says \"they have to know who I am.\" The men are astonished at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had. George then blurts out his secret that HE is the fastest gun alive, \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" | With the citizens understandably skeptical, George takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from Harvey Maxwell's (Allyn Joslyn) hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. | Later, while everyone is in church, where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold rides into town. A local boy tells him about George's display of gun skill. Even though he is on the run—and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope (John Dehner) and Dink Wells (Noah Beery, Jr.), who just want to escape the law—Harold is intent to remain in town until he can see this George Temple face-to-face. | Harold finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church. He sends Swope there to call him out. When the townspeople refuse to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time,\" Harold gives an order to Dink to find some kerosene and pour it everywhere. He then instructs Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if their fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town. | The townspeople now try to force George into the street. George must reveal the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle actually belonged to his father George Kelby (a famous lawman shot down in an ambush) and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. | Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for a while, but he, too, rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out — but without any of the loot. Swope toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie, thinks better of it and leaves. | Realizing that George is too terrified to face Harold, Lou Glover asks George for his gun. Glover intends to pose as George for the sake of the town. Reluctantly George straps on his gun and walks toward the door, warning everyone not to say anything because it won't take much for him to change his mind. | George meets Vinnie in the street, where both men draw their guns and fire. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople are attending the burials of both Harold and Kelby, telling the posse how the two men shot each other dead, Both the tombstones of Harold and Kelby are dated November 7, 1889. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed. A coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried instead. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.","m_cast":"Glenn Ford as George Temple | Jeanne Crain as Dora Temple | Broderick Crawford as Vinnie Harold | Russ Tamblyn as Eric Doolittle | Allyn Joslyn as Harvey Maxwell | Leif Erickson as Lou Glover | John Dehner as Taylor Swope | Noah Beery, Jr. as Dink Wells | J.

M. Kerrigan, Chris Olsen, the child actor, and Russ Tamblyn, who contributes an acrobatic dance reminiscent of his chore in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, weigh in with competent performances as Cross Creek's leading lights.\"[5] | Recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz praised the film, writing, \"Though the story gets lost for too long in too much psychological explaining, it redeems itself with a fine action-packed tense ending. Rouse does a nice job keying in on the reactions of the townsmen, stages some fine action sequences and the performances are solid (especially by Ford and Crawford).\"[6]","m_production":"Russ Tamblyn, who later co-starred in West Side Story (1961), performs a dance routine during a hoe-down early in the film that includes a \"shovel\" dance, i.e. dancing on shovels used as stilts. | [4] Roderick \"Rodd\" Redwing was Glenn Ford's gun coach and technical advisor for this film. Gun tricks were developed by Rodd Redwing with help from Jim Martin a 4 time California Fast Draw record holder. | Demonstrating his prowess with a gun, the Glenn Ford character asks a citizen to hold a glass of beer away from his body and, upon the count of three, let it drop. He shoots it before it hits the ground. The scene is shot from behind the glass of beer with Ford facing directly into the camera, but is actually the result of trick photography. (This scene later came back to haunt Ford when, while in the Service and on the pistol range, he was forced to prove his \"fast draw\" skill by an instructor who had seen the movie. Ford once recounted during a Tonight Show interview how he had to stand there for hours until he succeeded in drawing his pistol and hitting the target.)[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the story \"The Last Notch\" 1954 teleplay  by Frank D.
