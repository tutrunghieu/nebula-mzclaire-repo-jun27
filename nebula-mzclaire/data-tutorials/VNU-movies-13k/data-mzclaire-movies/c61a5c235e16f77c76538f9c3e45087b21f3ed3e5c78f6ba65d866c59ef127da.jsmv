{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A male teenager wakes up inside an underground elevator with no memory of his identity. A group of male youths greet him in a large grassy area called the \"Glade\" enclosed by tall, stone walls. The boys (\"Gladers\") have formed a rudimentary society with each assuming specialized tasks. Their leader, Alby, says that every boy eventually recalls his name but not his past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them may be the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route, returning before nightfall when the entrance closes. | While in a competition with another boy named Gally, the boy suddenly remembers his name: Thomas. The next day, he is attacked by Ben, a Runner delirious from being stung by a Griever – deadly techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die, as there is no cure for his injury. Alby and Minho, the lead Runner, later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas runs into the Maze to help, leaving all three trapped. Thomas lures a Griever into a closing passageway, causing it to be crushed. The trio manages to survive the night, returning the next morning. | The first-ever girl arrives in the elevator. She recognizes Thomas, though he cannot remember her. Thomas, Minho, and others enter the Maze, locate the Griever corpse, and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the youths and the Grievers and wants him punished, but Newt, the group's second-in-command, instead designates Thomas as a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a hand-constructed model of the Maze based on previous exploration. The Maze's numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence. Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a section within the Maze. | Teresa has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he recovers from the Griever sting. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze with the device and discover a possible exit. That night, the Maze entrance does not close while others open, letting Grievers pour in. A massacre ensues as the Gladers struggle to fight back or hide. Alby, Zart, and several others are killed. | Afterwards, Gally attacks Thomas and blames him for everything that happened. Thomas, who has had disconnected memory flashes since arriving, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, W.C.K.D.; the boys unknowingly have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and shares this information with Newt, Minho, Chuck, and Teresa. Thomas then exposes himself and Teresa, confessing that they worked with W.C.K.D. and studied the boys for years. | Meanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore the peace. Several Gladers form a group and free them. They approach the Maze in an attempt to find an escape, while Gally and a few others refuse to leave. Fighting Grievers as they go, several teens are killed. The survivors eventually enter a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, a woman named Ava Paige explains that the planet has been devastated by a massive solar flare, followed by a pandemic of a deadly virus called the Flare. The teens learn that they were part of an experiment studying for a cure. Paige shoots herself as the lab is attacked by armed men. | Gally suddenly appears with a gun and delirious from being stung by a Griever. He insists they must stay in the Maze and aims at Thomas. Minho kills Gally who shoots and kills Chuck who blocked to save Thomas. Masked armed men rush in and take the group to a helicopter. The helicopter flies over a vast desert wasteland and approaches a ruined city. The scene ends with the supposedly dead scientists meeting in a room. Paige notes that the experiment is successful; the survivors are now entering Phase Two.","m_cast":"Dylan O'Brien as Thomas, the last male to enter the Glade[4] | Kaya Scodelario as Teresa, the first and only female Glader[4] | Aml Ameen as Alby, the first male to enter the Glade and the leader of the Gladers[5] | Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt, second-in-command of the Gladers.[4] | Ki Hong Lee as Minho, the head runner | Will Poulter as Gally, a builder | Patricia Clarkson as Ava Paige, an official of W.C.K.D. | Blake Cooper as Chuck, a chubby and young Glader[6] | Dexter Darden as Frypan, a cook | Jacob Latimore as Jeff, a med-jack of the Gladers[7] | Chris Sheffield as Ben, a runner[8] | Joe Adler as Zart | Randall D.

Preliminary reports predicted the film would open with takings of over $30–32 million in North America.[23][24][25][26] According to movie ticket sale website Fandango, The Maze Runner was the biggest seller accounting for more than 50% of early tickets sales.[27] The film was released on September 19, 2014 in the United States and Canada across 3,604 locations and over 350 IMAX theaters.[28][29] It earned $1.1 million from Thursday night shows,[30] and $11.25 million on its opening day.[31] It topped the box office on its opening weekend with $32.5 million of which 9% of the gross came from IMAX theaters.[32] Its opening weekend gross is the seventh-highest for a film released in September,[33][34] and the 18th highest for a young-adult book adaptation.[35] The film earned a total of $102,272,088 at the North American box office becoming the twenty sixth highest-grossing film of 2014 in the U.S. and Canada.[36] | Outside North America, the film debuted in five countries a week prior to its North American release and earned a total of $8.3 million.[37] The film had a similar success overseas during its wide opening second weekend earning $38 million from 7,547 screens in 51 markets.

The site's consensus states: \"With strong acting, a solid premise, and a refreshingly dark approach to its dystopian setting, The Maze Runner stands out from the crowded field of YA sci-fi adventures\".[47] Metacritic gives the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[48] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.[49] | Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film a three out of four and described it as \"solid, well crafted and entertaining\".[50] Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com said she found the film intriguing, writing that \"it tells us a story we think we've heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail\".[51] The Seattle Times's Soren Anderson said the film was \"vastly superior to the book that inspired it\" and gave it a score of 3/4.[52] Tony Hicks of the San Jose Mercury News was \"hooked by the combination of fine acting, intriguing premise and riveting scenery\".[53] Matthew Toomey of ABC Radio Brisbane gave the film a grade of A−, giving praise to its intriguing premise saying that \"it held [his] attention for its full two hour running time\".[54] Justin Lowe of the Hollywood Reporter said it was \"consistently engaging\",[55] and Ella Taylor of Variety wrote \"as world-creation YA pictures go, The Maze Runner feels refreshingly low-tech and properly story-driven\".[56] | Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post said \"The Maze Runner unravels a few mysteries, but it spins even more\", giving it a 3/4.[57] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger wrote \"it does leave you wanting to see the next installment. And that's one special effect that very few YA movies ever pull off\".[58] Isaac Feldberg of We Got This Covered awarded the film 8/10 stars, calling it \"dark, dangerous and uncommonly thrilling\", while extolling it as \"one of the most engaging YA adaptations to hit theaters in quite some time.\"[59] Rick Bentley of the Fresno Bee praised Wes Ball's direction, saying that he \"created balance between a thin but solid script and first-rate action – and he doesn't waste a frame doing it\".[60] Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times called it \"a well-acted and intelligent thriller/futuristic sci-fi romp\".[61] Bilge Ebiri of New York magazine said he \"was quite riveted\".[62] Michael Sragow of the Orange County Register gave it a grade of \"B\" and said, \"Ball is deft, though, at evoking claustrophobia of every kind, whether in the open-air prison of the Glade or the actual tight spaces of the Maze. And he elicits a hair-trigger performance from O'Brien\".[63] | Claudia Puig of USA Today said \"a sci-fi thriller set in a vaguely post-apocalyptic future must create a fully drawn universe to thoroughly captivate the viewer. But Maze Runner feels only partially formed\", giving it a score of 2/4.[64] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said \"like Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit-tentialism, but more crowded and with the musk of bottled-up testosterone\".[65] Wesley Morris of the website Grantland said \"I think I have a touch of apocalepsy – excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors\".[66] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 rating and said \"it's bleak business, and as it hurries toward its explosive, expository conclusion, the film becomes nonsensical, too\".[67] Film critic Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe said \"teens should eat up this fantasy's scenery-chewing angst and doom, and the hopeful tale of survival and empowerment (to be continued in the inevitable sequel or sequels)\".[68]","m_production":"In an interview with Collider.com, director Wes Ball stated he had made a 3D computer-animated science fiction post-apocalyptic short film, titled Ruin, which he intended to use in order to gain access to Hollywood. He presented the short in 3D to 20th Century Fox. The studio initially considered a film adaptation of the short film, as it had the same tone of The Maze Runner novel they already planned to bring to the screen. Ball was then offered the chance to direct the novel adaptation.[9] | Creature designer Ken Barthelmey designed the monsters called Grievers for the film.[10] | For the role of Teresa, Kaya Scodelario was Ball's first choice as she was \"fantastic\" and because he loved her in the T.V. show Skins. Dylan O'Brien, the lead role, was rejected by Ball. Ball recounts, \"Dylan was actually ... I saw him early on, very early on and I overlooked him. It was a big learning experience there, because I overlooked him because of his hair. He had Teen Wolf hair and I couldn't see past that and so we were looking for our Thomas and it's a tough role to make, because he comes in as a boy and he leaves as a man, so it can't be like this badass action star that comes into this movie. It's about vulnerability up front and then he comes out of it and comes into his own and then the next movies are about the leader that emerges from the group. So finally Fox says 'We just did this movie, The Internship. There's this kid that's in this thing. He's like 20 years old. We think he's kind of got something.' So I watched his tape and was like 'Wait a minute, I've seen this kid before.' I looked him up online and there was one picture of him with a totally shaved head and it's this sweet vulnerable looking kid and I was like 'Whoa, interesting.' I said, 'Wait a minute, he's just so familiar' and I looked back at my old audition tapes, which we had thousands of, and there's Dylan. That guy I said 'No, definitely not him.' So we brought him back in and we started to talk with him and I'm like 'he's the coolest dude ever.'\" Blake Cooper entered the film via Twitter. Ball revealed a lot on Twitter, and many kids wanted to be Chuck. Cooper constantly bugged Ball, until Ball told him to give his tape to his casting director, and Ball was impressed by Cooper's tape and cast him.[9] | Principal photography started in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on May 13, 2013,[11] and officially ended on July 12, 2013.[12] | The film was completed in June 2014. | Composed by John Paesano, the soundtrack consists of 21 tracks and was released on September 16, 2014.[13]","m_sequel":"On October 11, 2013, it was reported that Twentieth Century Fox had acquired the rights to the second book, The Scorch Trials. A screenplay was written by T. S. Nowlin, with director Wes Ball supervising the scriptwriting.[72] The sequel was released on September 18, 2015.[73][74] On July 25, 2014, Ball announced at San Diego Comic-Con International that filming for the sequel would commence sometime between March and May 2015, should The Maze Runner become a success when it hits the theaters.[75] However, two weeks prior to the film's release 20th Century Fox decided to move ahead with the sequel and pre-production began in early September 2014 in New Mexico.[76] Cast members Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Ki-Hong Lee and Patricia Clarkson reprised their roles for the sequel, as did director Wes Ball. It was announced that Aidan Gillen would be joining the film to play Janson (\"Rat-Man\"),[77] as had Rosa Salazar who portrayed Brenda,[78] Jacob Lofland who starred as Aris Jones,[79] and Giancarlo Esposito who played Jorge Gallaraga.[80]","m_based_on":"The Maze Runner  by James Dashner","m_directed_by":"Wes Ball","m_produced_by":"Ellen Goldsmith-Vein | Wyck Godfrey | Marty Bowen | Lee Stollman","m_screenplay_by":"Noah Oppenheim | Grant Pierce Myers | T.S.

The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who considered it better than most young adult book-to-film adaptations, though the ending and the lack of plot clarity received some criticism. The film was also a commercial success, as it topped the box-office during its opening weekend with a $32.5 million debut, making it the seventh-highest grossing debut in September.
