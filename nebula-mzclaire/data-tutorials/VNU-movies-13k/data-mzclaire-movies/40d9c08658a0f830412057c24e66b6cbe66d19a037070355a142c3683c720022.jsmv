{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Arthur Bishop works as a \"mechanic\" (mafia slang for hitman).[4] He sneaks into the lavish home of a Colombian Drug Cartel leader and discreetly drowns him in his own pool. Upon returning to his home in Louisiana, he later meets with his friend and mentor, Harry McKenna, who pays Bishop for his work. | Later, Bishop finds that his new assignment is to kill Harry. Bishop's employer confirms by phone that the contract is correct, whereupon Bishop requests a face-to-face meeting. Dean tells Bishop about a failed mission in South Africa, in which assassins of Bishop's agency were killed. Dean relates that only two people knew about the mission—himself and Harry—and that Harry had been paid for the contract details. Bishop reluctantly kills Harry with Harry's own gun and makes it look like a carjacking. At Harry's funeral, Bishop meets Harry's reckless son Steve, who swears vengeance any way he can. Bishop stops Steve from trying to bait and kill a would-be carjacker and decides to train him as a mechanic. He adopts a chihuahua and instructs Steve to take the dog with him to a coffee shop each day at the same time. As Steve settles in to his routine, Bishop escalates his training by taking him to observe a contract kill. | Bishop later gives Steve a contract of his own. The target is a mechanic for another agency named Burke, who frequents the same coffee shop as Steve. Burke's only weaknesses are that he is interested in young men and small dogs. Burke makes his move on Steve and invites him out for drinks. Bishop instructs Steve to slip a large dose of Rohypnol into Burke's drink to cause an overdose. Steve ignores the instructions and instead goes with Burke to his apartment. Burke begins to undress, and Steve attempts to strangle him with a belt as Bishop had done with an earlier assignment. Steve manages to kill Burke after much effort and a lengthy fight. Dean expresses his disapproval of Bishop's use of Steve for the Burke contract, but Bishop replies that he was given that contract through Harry and not Dean. | Bishop is given a contract to kill Andrew Vaughn, the leader of a cult-like church. Steve and Bishop plan to inject Vaughn with adrenaline to simulate a heart attack, for which the paramedics would administer a fatal dose of epinephrine. A doctor arrives and sets Vaughn up with an IV of ketamine, which would inhibit the epinephrine's effects. They improvise and suffocate him in his hotel room, but are discovered and forced into a shootout with the guards. They slip out while the building is being evacuated and fly home separately. | At the airport, Bishop sees a supposed victim of the mission that Harry allegedly sold out. Bishop realizes that Dean had tricked him into killing Harry, and that Dean engineered the failed mission to cover up his own shady dealings. Later, Bishop is ambushed by a hit squad. After killing them, he discovers that Dean was behind the hit. Bishop goes home to call Steve, only to find that Steve has also been ambushed at Bishop's house. Bishop directs Steve to a hidden gun, which Steve uses to kill his ambushers. Bishop has Steve gather supplies for their new mission while he plots how to get to Dean. In the process, Steve finds his father's gun and realizes that Bishop killed Harry. | Bishop and Steve kill Dean in an ambush. On the way back, Bishop notices Steve carrying Harry's gun. When they stop for gas, Steve floods the ground with fuel while pretending to fill the truck. He walks to a safe distance and shoots the gas, blowing up Bishop's truck with Bishop still inside. Steve returns to Bishop's house and performs two actions that Bishop told him not to do: playing a record on the turntable, and taking the 1966 Jaguar E-Type Bishop had been working on. As he is driving away, Steve notices a note on the passenger seat: \"Steve, if you're reading this, then you're dead!\" Moments later, the car explodes, killing him; at the same time, Bishop's house also explodes. Back at the gas station, a security video reveals that Bishop had escaped from the truck, seconds before the explosion indicating that Steve failed to kill Bishop. Bishop gets into a spare truck he had by the beach and drives away.","m_cast":"Jason Statham as Arthur Bishop | Ben Foster as Steve McKenna | Tony Goldwyn as Dean Sanderson | Donald Sutherland as Harry McKenna | Jeff Chase as Burke [5] | John McConnell as Andrew Vaughn | Mini Andén as Sarah | Stuart Greer as Ralph","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, producers of the 1972 original Mechanic, sought to make an update.
