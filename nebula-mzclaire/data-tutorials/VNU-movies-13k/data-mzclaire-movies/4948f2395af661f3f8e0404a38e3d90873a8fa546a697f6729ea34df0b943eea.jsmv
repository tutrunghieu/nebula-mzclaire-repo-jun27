John Gielgud and Barry Bostwick both won Golden Globe awards.","m_production":"Auschwitz, Montreal, USS New Jersey, many locations in Europe and United States | During preproduction, Dan Curtis lobbied the Polish Communist government tirelessly for permission to film on the grounds of the Auschwitz concentration camp, and after two years was eventually allowed, making War and Remembrance the first major commercial motion picture to film there. His request was aided by the intercession of the Polish state TV network, and the support of Poland's preeminent WWII expert, who approved the script.[4] Curtis said that he was allowed to film at Auschwitz on condition that the script not have \"one word about Polish anti-Semitism\" during the war.[5] Filming on the miniseries began with production at Auschwitz from January to May 1986. When the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened nearby, causing legitimate fears of fallout spreading across Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, Curtis called in nuclear scientists from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna to give the location a clean bill of health, but allowed any crew members still afraid to wait in Munich for the production to return. The crematoriums were rebuilt adjacent to the original site, from the original German blueprints, because they had been demolished by the Nazis at the end of the war. Both Curtis and star Jane Seymour contracted pneumonia in the brutal sub-zero temperatures there.[6] Several actual Auschwitz-Birkenau survivors were cast as extras for the Auschwitz-Birkenau selection sequence and former Auschwitz internee Branko Lustig, later a two-time Oscar-winning producer, served as assistant director on the series. | Filmed from January 1986 to September 1987, the 1,492 page script (by Earl W. Wallace, Dan Curtis, and Herman Wouk) contained 2,070 scenes. There were 757 sets: 494 in Europe, including France, Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, West Germany, England, and Poland, and 263 in the United States (including Hawaii) and Canada. There were 358 speaking parts in the script; 30,310 extras were employed in Europe and 11,410 in the United States. | The series shot in Yugoslavia in Zagreb and Osijek, where the old town district of Tvrđa, a Habsburg star-shaped fortress, was used as a primary location, doubling for the almost identical fortress town of Theresienstadt, in Czechoslovakia, which was converted by the Nazis to a Jewish ghetto. Filming took place in France throughout Paris, including the Paris Opera, where a scene from The Marriage of Figaro was staged with a 42-piece symphony orchestra and 500 extras,[7] and Lourdes, where the production took over the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes; in West Germany in Baden-Baden and Berchtesgaden, where members of the United States Army, stationed nearby were hired as extras for some of the scenes shot at Hitler's Eagle's Nest; in Rome and Siena, Italy; London and Cambridge, England; and Vienna, Austria. Scenes set in Russia were filmed in Montreal in temperatures reaching 40 degrees below zero Celsius. | In the US, the production shot extensively in and around Los Angeles, as well as in Long Beach, California aboard the USS New Jersey, in Bremerton, Washington, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, in Pensacola, Florida, in Mobile, Alabama, aboard the USS Alabama, and throughout Hawaii, where a large group of warships were assembled for filming at Waianae.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Dan Curtis","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"12","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Dietrich Lohmann","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":"The Winds of War | War and Remembrance is an American miniseries based on the novel of the same name written by Herman Wouk, which aired from November 13, 1988 to May 14, 1989.
