{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Toaster is the leader of a group of appliances consisting of an antique radio, a gooseneck lamp, Lampy; an electric blanket, Blanky; and a vacuum cleaner, Kirby, who belong to their master, Rob. They wait every day at Rob's cottage for his return with an increasing sense of abandonment, causing Blanky to hallucinate about finally seeing Rob return. One day towards the end of July, the appliances are devastated to learn that a real estate broker is selling the house. Not wanting to accept the fact that the Master would abandon them, Toaster decides that the group should head out and find Rob. The appliances connect a car battery to an office chair pulled by Kirby and set out into the world, following Radio's signal broadcasts from the city, where Rob lives. | On their journey, the appliances encounter numerous harrowing adventures where they learn to work together. Shortly after stopping to rest within a forest, a nightmare where Rob and Toaster get tortured by an evil smirking clown followed by a violent storm during nightfall wakes Toaster and the others with the storm blowing Blanky up into the trees, and Lampy risks his life by using himself as a lightning rod in an attempt to recharge the group's dead battery. After recovering Blanky the next morning, they try to cross a waterfall, but during an attempt to cross it, everyone falls in except for Kirby, who dives after them and rescues them, and the appliances wash up into the middle of a swamp. After losing both the chair and the battery, the group resorts to pulling a disabled Kirby through the swamp. After losing their balance and almost drowning in a mud hole, they are rescued by Elmo St. Peters, the owner of an appliance parts store, where they get scared by a group of partially dismantled or disfigured appliances, who have lost hope and are at risk of being disassembled or sold, almost in a prison-like motif. When Radio is taken from a shelf and about to have his radio tubes taken apart, the appliances frighten St. Peters by pretending to be a ghost and flee to the city, while most of the worn-out appliances escape the store and quickly return to their masters' homes. | Rob, who is now living in an apartment as a young adult and is about to depart for college, leaves with his girlfriend Chris to return to the cottage and retrieve the appliances to take with him. After secretly witnessing this, Rob's newer appliances in the apartment become resentful. When the appliances arrive at Rob's apartment, the newer appliances explain that they are \"on the cutting edge of technology\". After answering Toaster and the other four appliances their question of what they mean by singing their song to them, they kick them into the apartment's dumpster from the window, where they are shortly transported to Ernie's Disposal, a junkyard. Thinking that the cottage has been broken into and trashed, and his original appliances stolen, Rob and Chris return to his apartment, where his black and white television, who originally lived with the appliances, broadcasts false advertisements to encourage Rob and Chris to go to Ernie's Disposal to find Toaster and the other four appliances, and bring them back. | At the junkyard, the appliances are tormented by a maniacal crusher with its henchman, an evil tower crane with an electromagnet that picks up junk and places them on its conveyor belt that leads to the crusher. When they discover that Rob is in the junkyard, they are encouraged that he still needs them after all, and then, they attempt to foil the magnet in order to allow Rob to find them. After being foiled numerous times, the magnet decides to pick up Rob as well as his appliances, and drops them on the conveyor belt. Toaster sacrifices his life by jumping into the crusher's gears to disable it just in time to prevent it from killing Rob and destroying his appliances. Rob survives and returns back to the apartment with all of the five appliances in tow, including a mangled Toaster. And then, Rob repairs Toaster and takes the five appliances with him to college, along with Chris.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film rights to The Brave Little Toaster, the original novel by Thomas M. Disch, were purchased by the Walt Disney Studios in 1982, two years after its appearance in the publication Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazine.[5] After animators John Lasseter and Glen Keane had finished a short 2D/3D test film based on the book Where the Wild Things Are, Lasseter and producer Thomas L. Wilhite decided they wanted to produce a whole feature this manner. | The story they chose was The Brave Little Toaster, and this became the first CGI film Lasseter ever pitched.[6] But in their enthusiasm, they ran into issues pitching the idea to two high level Disney executives, animation administrator Ed Hansen, and Disney president Ron W. Miller. During Lasseter and Wilhite's pitch, the film was rejected due to the costs of having traditionally animated characters inside then-expensive computer-generated backgrounds. | A few minutes after the meeting, Lasseter received a phone call from Hansen and was instructed to come down to his office, where Lasseter was informed that he was dismissed. Originally set to commence at the Disney studios with a budget of $18 million, development was then transferred to the new Hyperion Pictures, which had been created by former Disney employees Tom Wilhite and Willard Carroll, who took the production along with them after Wilhite successfully requested access to it from then-president Ron Miller.[3][5] As a result, the film was financed as an independent production by Disney, with the aid of electronics company TDK Corporation and video distributor CBS-Fox Home Video. | The cost was reduced to $2.3 million as production began, approximately a third of the budget offered when in-house.[3] Despite providing funds to get it off the ground, Disney was not actually involved with production of the film.[7] Rees later commented that there were external forces at work that had the right to say this was a cheap film that could be shipped overseas, which the staff objected to and therefore were willing to make sacrifices to improve the quality of the film despite its limited budget. They were dedicated to making something they were proud of rather than simply producing a kid's film, and to following the Disney's Nine Old Men influenced storytelling.[7] They also aimed to \"not belittle it because it happens to be drawn\". Tom Wilhite helped to maintain the creative integrity of the project.[7] | In 1986, Hyperion began to work on the story and character development.[3] Jerry Rees, a crew member on two previous Disney films, The Fox and the Hound and Tron, and co-writer of the screenplay along with Joe Ranft, was chosen to lead the project.[5] He had been working on an animated adaptation of Will Eisner's The Spirit with Brad Bird, and received a call from Wilhite asking him to develop, write, and direct, explaining that The Brave Little Toaster was being adapted into a short, but that a feature film was possible if handled correctly.[7] Joe Ranft and Rees worked on developing the story and designing the storyboards. When animators ran out of pages to storyboard, Rees sat down and wrote more of the script.[7] Much work had to be done to adapt the book, for example there are only around four lines of dialogue that ended up in the movie.[7] | There was a junkyard sequence in the original text, but it took place in the middle of the film. However, Rees decided that it should instead serve as the film's finale because the setting is the graveyard for appliances.[7] He also wanted a definitive moment that earn the Toaster the title of \"brave\", so had him jump into the gears to save his Master, a plot point that wasn't in the book.[7] Having the character's voices in his head when writing the script helped to personalise the dialogue. Rees even reworked some of the already-completed script in order to customise sections based on the actors' personalities.[7] After cutting together the storyboards and scene-planning in Taipai, production manager Chuck Richardson explained the logistics issues - the film would be 1:50 minutes long. As a result, Rees cut around 20 minutes worth of the story â€“ these deleted scenes that have not been released to the public.[7] | Rees was still in the process of writing when he decided to find actors. Many auditioneers presented cartoony, exaggerated voices, which displeased him, because they didn't believe their characters or bring a reality to the role.[7] As a result, he sought out voice talent from The Groundlings improvisational group, after being recommended by Ranft who took classes there, and appreciated the honesty and naturalism they gave to their performances.[7] | Many of their members, including Jon Lovitz (Radio), Phil Hartman (Air Conditioner/Hanging Lamp), Tim Stack (Lampy), Judy Toll (Mish-Mash/Two-Faced Sewing Machine), and Mindy Sterling (Rob's mother/Two-Faced Sewing Machine) voiced characters in the film. Already established as an actor through Tony the Tiger and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, Thurl Ravenscroft was cast as Kirby the vacuum cleaner.[5] Heading the ensemble cast were Groundlings performer Deanna Oliver as Toaster, and newcomer Timothy E. Day as Blanky. | Oliver originally auditioned for Air Conditioner using a Bette Davis impression, but accepted the lead when offered.[7] Rees, who had conceived Toaster as a female character, later recalled an anecdote where a crew member \"slammed the door and walked out\" because he had hired a woman to play the lead role.[7] Day had never done acting work before, and had asked his mother to take him to auditions after becoming fascinated with a child actor voice-over.[7] The actors brought a lot of comedy and funny moments to the dark themes that shrouded the film.[7] | Recording sessions did not take place at Disney; the crew found and renovated a small derelict property in Hollywood.[7] When recording, Rees first had each scene delivered as written, and then allowed the voice actors to play around with the dialogue, and ended up using many of the improvised lines in the final film.[7] His direction primarily consisted of ensuring the performances were as natural and realistic as possible.[7] Some of the recordings were done in group sessions. | For example most of Oliver's recording sessions were with Stack and Rees.[7] After being cast, Jon Lovitz got an opportunity to appear on Saturday Night Live. Because Rees had written the part for Lovitz, he tried to find a way to keep him in the film, and ended up doing a marathon recording session, recording all his lines of dialogue on one night. Rees then performed as the stand-in for Lovitz when the others were recording.[7] Rees described Day as an \"amazing performer\", who would ask about his character's motivation and the context of each scenario before recording his lines. | He was nicknamed \"one-take Timmy\" due to nailing the emotional truth of the text so quickly, such as crying loudly or delivering a line with a quiver in his voice.[7] Comparing this film to the sequels, where a high note was dubbed by another singer due to being off-key, Olivier noted that in this film it would have been kept in due to being part of the character.[7] | The crew initially worked on pre-producing the film for six months in Los Angeles in 1985, and then a staff of ten people moved to Taiwan with Rees for another six months to work with Taiwan's Wang Film Productions Co., Ltd. (headed by James Wang) for the principal animation,[5] then returned for a third six-month work period for post-production in the U.S.[7][1] Rees' wife Rebecca was the film's directing animator, and she taught classes to the Taiwanese animators in order to improve the quality of their output. | The animators also had a mixture of ex-Disney employees and college graduates from CalArts.[7] Every day, they had to do what would normally be done across a two-week period at Disney.[7] The colour stylist was veteran Disney animator Ken O'Connor, a member of Disney's feature animation department from its first feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[5] and Oliver likened the light-hearted frog sequence to Merrie Melodies.[7] A massive TDK sign was included by Rees as the company was a big sponsor.[7] The animators used many visual cues to help inform the audience about plot and character. For example during Toaster's nightmare at the beginning of the film, he burns toast and emits smoke, which symbolises his guilt and fear of being responsible. | They deduced Toasters would be afraid of things like forks and falling into the bathtub while plugged in, so included them in this sequence. Oliver described the transition from bathtub sparks to lighting outside the house as proper filmmaking.[7] Similarly, Blanky being a certain shade of yellow bears significance to the plot. In the beginning of their journey, the other characters dismiss him, even Toaster when he tries to snuggle him. Then Toaster encounters a flower that is the same colour, who also wants to snuggle. After explaining it is just a reflection, he walks away, thereby making the flower wilt. The next moment shows Toaster proactively rescuing Blanket. The idea is that the flower informs Toaster that his actions will make Blanky wilt too.[7] | The film score of The Brave Little Toaster was composed and conducted by David Newman and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic. Newman's score for this movie was one of his earlier works and apparently one that he felt very close to. He did not view it as a cheerful one, and decided to give the film a dramatic score to reinforce the serious nature of many of the film's themes. In writing the score, Newman, \"tapped into an inherent sadness in being abandoned and seeking reunion.\"[4] Rees admired his \"rich, classical style\", chose him so the film didn't have \"'cartoon' music\".[1] He said that Newman got into the headspace of the characters, and thought in terms of these inanimate objects as being real characters. | He said Newman's score was as \"grand as anything he would ever do\", rather than writing differently due to the medium being animation.[7] He wove death, joy, love, loss, and struggle into the work.[7] Newman's composing style was influenced by his philosophy that behind every \"chord of joy\" lies an element of sadness, whether it being the knowledge it won't last forever, that it is a facade for a deeper emotion, or that joy comes from sadness.[7] He used lush strings in the opening scenes to convey a sense of longing.[1] As the characters are introduced, the score becomes more lively, and each character has their own theme, influence by their personality. For example Kirby the vacuum cleaner is grumpy and old so his theme consists of low chords, whereas Radio was given a brassy fanfare to reflect his self-important personality.[1] These musical motifs wove their way into the entire movie score.[1] At some points, the style of music was used to provoke an emotional response. | For example when Air Conditioner breaks down, the orchestra trembles, then bursts with energy. Then the music returns to a somber tone, as the appliances realise there is truth to what he said.[1] When they explore the outside world for the first time, the music fills with a \"pastoral grandeur\", and when they enter the woods strings, flute, bells, and brass enter to convey the simultaneous magic and danger of the outdoors.[1] The film also contains a Busby Berkeley Italian opera-esque sequence containing a fish.[1] The score was finally given a limited release in 2004.[8] The film contains four original songs (\"City of Light\", \"It's a B-Movie\", \"Cutting Edge\", and \"Worthless\") that were written by Van Dyke Parks. Rees \"felt uncomfortable with the full Broadway book musical approach\", and his philosophy was that the songs should be part of the action and plot without stopping for a big production number. | He wanted characters to be able to break out into song whenever they wanted to, just like the films of the Hollywood Golden Age.[1] Once they were written, Newman used them in his own score, for example the first song \"City of Light\" which shows the character's naivety and apprehension, contains a motif that gets more complex as the film goes on.[1] This approach made the score more cohesive.[1] \"It's a B-Movie\" is filled with black humour and the omonous pipe organ as the mutant appliances scare the main characters.[1] The synthesizer-driven \"Cutting Edge\" sees the Master's state-of-the-art appliances boast about how great they are.[1] The poignant number \"Worthless\" is a track filled with piano, strings, guitar, and vocals which are abruptly cut off when the singing cars are crushed.[1] This junkyard sequence climax evokes feelings of desperation, danger, suspense and real world peril.[1] Norman \"reprises the score's subtle and varied themes over the end credits\".[1] Newman wrote and orchestrated the score over a 50-hour period, including his 12-hour flight to Japan to record it with the orchestra in Maeda Hall. | The New Japan Philharmonic gave the score a \"luxurious sound\" that was impressive given the limited resources available.[1] The sound effects were not from a library, and was instead created by foley-ing various real world objects around Los Angeles, such an objects in antique stores. This was because Rees wanted to creates new characters with new sounds.[7] The sound mixers, including former Disney studio mixer Shaun Murphy who recorded the score, asked how to do their job due to the film being animated, and Rees explained they should mix it like any other movie instead of a cartoon.[7][1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Brave Little ToasterÂ  by Thomas M.

Disch. The film was directed by Jerry Rees. The film is set in a world where household appliances and other electronics come to life, pretending to be lifeless in the presence of humans. The story focuses on five appliancesâ€” a toaster, a gooseneck lamp, an electric blanket, a radio, and a vacuum cleanerâ€”who go on a quest to search for their original owner. | The film was produced by Hyperion Animation along with The Kushner-Locke Company. Many CalArts graduates, including the original members of Pixar Animation Studios were involved with this film.[3] While the film received a limited theatrical release, The Brave Little Toaster was popular on home video and was followed by two sequels a decade later: The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars (1998) and The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue (1999). Both sequels were released out of chronological order. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v \"Newman_BLT_Score\". Jerryrees.com.
