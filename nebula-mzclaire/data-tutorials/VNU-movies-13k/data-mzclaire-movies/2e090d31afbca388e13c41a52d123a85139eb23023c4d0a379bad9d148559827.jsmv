His boss offers to fund the filming of it with Alfredo as director and Carmen as the female star. Alfredo also gets a Danish film crew to help with production. The main role is offered to Máximo Valverde who refuses it, so the role is offered to Magnus, one of the members of the film crew. | At Carmen's suggestion, Alfredo's boss changes the final scene so that Carmen is to have sex with her male co-star so as to get herself pregnant.
