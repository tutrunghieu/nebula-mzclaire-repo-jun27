To start a relationship with her, he dumps his girlfriend (Byron), a singer in one of his nightclubs who becomes murderously jealous. He must also deal with mobsters who try to take over his nightclubs. Swindled by an upper-class con-man (Ireland) into voluntarily selling out to the mobsters anyway all his valuable assets including the gambling-casino nightclubs, a racehorse and a boxer, in order to invest in a gold-mining scam that is eventually unmasked as a fraud, he finds himself broke and in a gunfight with the mobsters, who have been deceived by a gang member with a grudge against him into thinking that they need to kill him. Non-fatally wounded in the gunfight, he is about to make an escape from his mobster pursuers when his jilted girlfriend the nightclub singer vindictively tries to kill him by hitting him with her car. He is struck a glancing blow that knocks him down, and she flees the scene. At that point, Lady Willens, with Forster's butler, arrive on the scene and come to his aid. Forster, still alive, looks up from the gutter in which he is lying and says, \"Susan\" with relief and gratitude but then collapses. Susan has told him that he will be alright and tells the butler, \"Let's bring him home,\" leaving the audience to wonder, as they pick him up and carry him to Susan's car, whether he is still alive or whether he will survive his injuries.","m_cast":"Dane Clark - Jim Forster | Kathleen Byron - Pat | Naomi Chance - Lady Susan Willens | Meredith Edwards - Dave Davies | Anthony Forwood - Lord Peter Willens | Eric Pohlmann - Arturo Colonna | Anthony Ireland - Richard Farning | Max Bacon - Maxie | Mona Washbourne - Miss Minter | Jane Griffiths - Lady Jane Greer | Richard Shaw - Louis | George Pastell - Jacko Spina | Enzo Coticchia - Angelo Colonna | Hal Osmond - Stable Groom | Percy Marmont - Lord Willens-Hortland | Felix Felton - Boxing Promoter","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Patrick Jenkins Sam Newfield","m_produced_by":"Anthony Hinds","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dane Clark","m_music_by":"Ivor Slaney","m_cinematography":"Walter J.
