{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Four lifelong friends from the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, Douglas \"Doug\" MacRay, James \"Jem\" Coughlin, Albert \"Gloansy\" MacGloan, and Desmond \"Dez\" Elden, rob a bank. They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but release her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the authorities, and to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance grows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug tells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, whom he believes went to live with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his father's footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to jail. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades her that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police. | After Claire tells Doug about being harassed and her car vandalized by Alex, a local thug, Doug enlists Jem for a favor, which they can never talk about. Doug and Jem don hockey masks and violently assault the offenders without Jem knowing the true reason for the favor is to protect Claire. | FBI Agent Adam Frawley surveils the gang and recognizes their ties to local crime lord Fergus \"Fergie\" Colm, who has another robbery planned for them. During a visit to his father Stephen in prison, Doug reveals his plans to leave Boston and go to Florida. The gang's next robbery in the North End goes awry, and the gang barely escapes. The gang is interrogated by Frawley, but he fails to get any confessions and is forced to release them. Doug asks Claire if she will go away with him, and she agrees. When Frawley learns that Claire quit her job, he wiretaps her phone, and threatens to prosecute her as an accomplice after realizing that she is seeing Doug. Shocked to discover that her lover was one of her assailants, she is forced to cooperate with the FBI and breaks up with Doug. Meanwhile, Fergie and Jem are pressuring Doug about the next heist, but Doug is determined to get out. Fergie threatens to kill Claire if Doug does not go through with the job, and reveals to Doug how he controlled his father by making his mother an addict, which led to her suicide. Doug gives in but swears that he will kill Fergie if anything happens to Claire. | At Fenway Park, Doug and Jem enter disguised as Boston police officers, steal $3,500,000 in gate cash, and prepare to escape in an ambulance disguised as paramedics. Doug's ex-girlfriend Krista, threatened by Frawley and heartbroken by Doug's going away without her, reveals enough for the FBI to surround Fenway before the gang can get out. The gang is caught in a firefight with FBI SWAT, and Dez and Gloansy are killed. Frawley spots Jem and they exchange gunfire. Jem, determined not to go back to prison and out of ammunition, commits suicide by cop by running out of cover with his guns unloaded and is killed. Knowing that Claire is in danger and that he will never escape as long as Fergie is alive, Doug murders Fergie and his bodyguard and calls Claire. Watching from across the street via binoculars, Doug sees that the FBI are with Claire as she tells him to come over, he at first thinks she means to betray him, but eventually she gives him a clue to warn him away, which he picks up on. So Doug flees instead, donning an MBTA uniform and escaping on a train; having left a note on Frawley's car for him to \"Go Fuck Yourself\". Later, whilst gardening, Claire finds a bag buried containing the stolen money, a tangerine, and a note from Doug, suggesting that she can make better use of the money than he can, and that they'll hopefully see each other again. Claire donates the money, in memory of Doug's mother, to refurbish the local ice hockey arena where Doug once played. From the deck of a small house, Doug looks out over the water, forlorn and alone, but seemingly safe in Florida.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Town received largely positive reviews, with critics praising the film's action sequences, Affleck's direction, and Renner's performance. Metacritic gives the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[20] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 93%, based on 214 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Tense, smartly written, and wonderfully cast, The Town proves that Ben Affleck has rediscovered his muse -- and that he's a director to be reckoned with.\"[21] | Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Renner's performance and Affleck's direction.[22] In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott commented on the opening heist, \"That sequence, like most of the other action set pieces in the film, is lean, brutal and efficient, and evidence of Mr. Affleck’s skill and self-confidence as a director.\"[23] Xan Brooks, in The Guardian, wrote that the action sequences were \"sharply orchestrated\" but added \"it's a bogus, bull-headed enterprise all the same; a film that leaves no cliche untrampled.\"[24] Justin Chang wrote in Variety that the action scenes strike \"an ideal balance between kineticism and clarity\" aided by cinematographer Robert Elswit and film editor Dylan Tichenor.[25] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film an A+, noting that he found the film incredibly similar to Michael Mann's Heat, which he described as \"one of [his] favorite movies of all time.\"[26] The reviewers at Spill.com also praised one of the shootout scenes, saying \"It is surely the best shootout scene we have seen in decades.\"[27] Writing in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Laremy Lengel titled his review \"The Town Works Best if You Avoid the Heat,\" also referencing Mann's film.[28] | As a Boston-based crime drama, the film forms part of a \"crime-movie subgenre\" typically marked by \"flavorsome accents, pungent atmosphere and fatalistic undertow\", according to Chang. Within that subgenre, which includes The Boondock Saints, The Departed, Mystic River and Affleck's Gone Baby Gone, The Town is more of a straightforward crime-procedural and has a more optimistic outlook.[25]","m_production":"In 2006, director Adrian Lyne brought Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves to producer Graham King. King in turn showed it to Warner Bros. studio, who agreed to make an adaptation directed by Lyne and written by Sheldon Turner.[6] Given screenwriting attempts by Turner, Hogan himself and screenwriter Peter Craig did not manage to build a script that fit Warner's requirement for a standard two-hour length movie with a $37 million budget.[7] By 2008, The Town was decided as the title and Ben Affleck, fresh off his directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone, was brought in to serve as star, director and co-writer.[8] Affleck wanted to direct a movie \"I personally researched and understood\", inviting high school classmate Aaron Stockard to work with him on the script, and travelling to Boston to research on the subject. While Affleck had grown up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he barely heard of Charlestown before joining the project. Affleck and Stockard conducted many interviews with the Charlestown community, as well as the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force in Boston.[7] Later the film's actors also researched within the community to make for more believable characters and performances. Charlestown locals also joined the cast, mostly as extras.[9] | After viewing Pete Postlethwaite's audition video for Inception (2010), Ben Affleck was determined to cast him as Fergus Colm. Effectively, Affleck begged Postlethwaite for his involvement and was ultimately successful, bringing him to the set to film his role in just two days. Affleck later claimed that Postlethwaite told him, upon completing the role of \"Fergie\", \"I'm glad you stuck with it, you stayed on me.\"[10] | Filming began in late August 2009 in Boston.[11][12] The former MASSBank branch located in Melrose, Massachusetts, was used as the location for the first robbery of the film, taking on the name Cambridge Merchants Bank[13] (the exterior shots, however, are of Cambridge Savings Bank in Harvard Square). Filming also took place at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut, for casino scenes,[14] Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts, for use of their visiting room, and at Anderson Regional Transportation Center in Woburn, Massachusetts, for the ending Amtrak scenes.[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Prince of Thieves  by Chuck Hogan","m_directed_by":"Ben Affleck","m_produced_by":"Graham King Basil Iwanyk","m_screenplay_by":"Ben Affleck Peter Craig Aaron Stockard","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jon Hamm Jeremy Renner Blake Lively Titus Welliver Pete Postlethwaite Chris Cooper","m_music_by":"Harry Gregson-Williams David Buckley","m_cinematography":"Robert Elswit","m_edited_by":"Dylan Tichenor","m_production_company":"Legendary Pictures GK Films Thunder Road Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.
