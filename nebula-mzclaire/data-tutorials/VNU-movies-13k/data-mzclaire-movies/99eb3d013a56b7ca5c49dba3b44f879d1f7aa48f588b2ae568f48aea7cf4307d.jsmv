{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Stargate took in $16.7 million on its opening weekend,[50] and received mixed reactions from critics; while it was panned by some critics such as Roger Ebert,[51] several positive reviews counterbalanced this leading to a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes.[52] Although the film was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films,[16] Emmerich and Devlin ultimately moved on to produce Independence Day, and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels.[53] In the intervening time, copyright-holder MGM succeeded the film with the television series Stargate SG-1 without the input of Emmerich and Devlin. | Stargate SG-1 has won the Saturn Award for Best Syndicated Television Series on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting.[54] More recently it has received acclaim for its visual effects, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget.[55] On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that it would not be renewing Stargate SG-1 for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the Nielsen ratings.[56] Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating websites in reaction to exhibit their commitment to the series.[57] Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of SG-1 are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting.[58] Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told the fansite GateWorld exclusively that he was working to continue SG-1.[59] Currently, no network or company has ordered new episodes of SG-1, so the show is on hold until a new buyer can be found. However, SciFi has attempted to block other networks from taking up the show, citing its original exclusive contract with MGM.[60]Atlantis proved to be equally as successful as SG-1, with Nielsen ratings and viewership. The Stargate franchise in 2009 won a Constellation Award in the category of Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in 2008.[61] | The average viewership to Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis was around 10 million a week worldwide. According to Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright, the show is popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in homeland Canada. It was estimated that around 30 million Stargate DVDs were sold worldwide in 2006.[62] | The DVD release of Stargate: The Ark of Truth in the US earned MGM/Fox US $1.59 million in rentals in the first week after the release, and another US $1.38 million in rentals in the second week. In its third week it earned US $1.19 million in rentals totaling US $4.16 million . The DVD has also earned US $9.0 million in sales.[8] Stargate: Continuum would go on to gross over $8 million United States dollars in the United States.[9] The film sparked mostly positive reviews with movie critics.[63][64][65] A third Stargate SG-1 movie was planned to follow Continuum but the third movie was put on hold with any other future Stargate movies; the film would have centered around the character of Jack O'Neill.[66]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":null,"m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":null,"m_country":null,"m_language":null,"m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Stargate (1994)\".
