{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bobby (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Kate (Lynn Collins) are a young couple who have been together ten months. Kate is 11 weeks pregnant. They can't make up their minds where to go on the Fourth of July,[2] or whether to have the baby, so they decide to flip a coin. After Bobby flips the coin, they both run off Brooklyn Bridge in opposite directions. From that moment on two separate storylines are followed. | One storyline takes place in Brooklyn, where Bobby and Kate decide to go visit Kate's family. On the way they pick up a stray dog, whose owner they try to locate. Kate's family has its share of family drama, with an uncle who is institutionalized and suffers from memory loss, a brother who died five years earlier, and a sister who is taking a year off before going to college, much to her mother's dismay. | The other storyline takes place in Manhattan (beginning in Chinatown), where Bobby and Kate find a cellphone belonging to a criminal who values it at $500,000. They try to set up an exchange, but after narrowly escaping pursuit from a killer, Bobby throws the cellphone onto a passing boat. | Both storylines end the next day on a bridge, with the lines \"What do you want to do now? / What do we do now? I don't know. I guess we just keep going\". | The storylines are also set apart by colors of vehicles and Bobby and Kate's clothing. In the Manhattan/Chinatown storyline, they both wear easily recognizable yellow, a dress for her and a t-shirt for him, they took a yellow cab, while in the Brooklyn storyline, they are dressed in more subtle shades of green and Kate is driving her green car. In the first scene on the bridge Kate wears the yellow dress from the Manhattan story, while Bobby wears the outfit he'll wear in Brooklyn.","m_cast":"Lynn Collins as Kate | Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Bobby | Assumpta Serna as Silvia, Kate's mother | Olivia Thirlby as Sophie, Kate's sister | Nelson Landrieu as Felix, Kate's father | Louis Arcella as Diego, Kate's uncle","m_reception":"Uncertainty received mixed reviews and holds a rotten rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews with an average rating of 5.4 out of 10.[3] The film also has a score of 45 on Metacritic based on 9 reviews.[4]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Scott McGehee David Siegel","m_produced_by":"Becky Glupczynski Scott McGehee David Siegel","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Lynn Collins Joseph Gordon-Levitt Assumpta Serna Olivia Thirlby","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"IFC Films, Myriad Pictures (International)","m_release_dates":"September 8, 2008 (2008-09-08) (TIFF) 000000002009-11-13-0000November 13, 2009","m_running_time":"105 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$36,689[1] | Uncertainty is a 2008 indie crime drama thriller film written, produced, and directed by American independent filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel and starring Lynn Collins and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
