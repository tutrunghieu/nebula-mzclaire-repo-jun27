{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Cynthia Glenn (Esther Williams) is a swimming instructor in Los Angeles, California, where she lives with her scatterbrained aunt and uncle Nona and Hobart (Spring Byington and Henry Travers). While demonstrating a dive to her students, she catches the eye of an interested stranger, Bob Delbar (Carleton G. Young). Cynthia returns home to find that she has received flowers from the stranger. The two court for one month, and then get married. | They leave immediately after the wedding on their honeymoon to the hotel Monte Belva, where they encounter the famous opera singer, Nils Knudsen (Lauritz Melchior). Major Thomas Milvaine (Van Johnson), who is also staying at the hotel, notices Cynthia. J.P. Bancroft, a rich colleague, calls Bob and insists that he come to Washington to complete a deal. While Cynthia cries over Bob's departure, Tommy, who is staying next door, comforts her. | The next day, Cynthia ventures down to the pool, where she and J.P.Bancroft's daughter, Maude (Frances Gifford) speculate as to which hotel guest is Major Thomas Milvaine, the decorated war hero, who shot down \"16... or was it 26 war planes?\" and was stuck on a deserted island for a month. After Maude teases Cynthia about being at the hotel without her husband on her vacation, Cynthia performs an elaborate dive and swims around the pool, where she proceeds to run into Major Milvaine himself, who can't actually swim, so she teaches him how. | For the rest of the week, Cynthia and Tommy continue accompanying each other to dinner and other activities around the hotel, including swimming. On the last day, Cynthia receives a telegram from Bob informing her that he will not be able to come back to the hotel for another week. However, Tommy is leaving the next morning, and Cynthia is distraught, so she retires to her room. Tommy realizes he loves her, rushes to their adjoining balcony, confesses his love for her and tells her that he is planning on staying for another week. However, Cynthia reiterates that she's a married woman, therefore, she won't let him hop over the hedge separating their two balconies and make love to her. She calls Bob in Washington and begs him to return, but he tells her that he can't. | Cynthia looks for Tommy the next morning, but is told that he has checked out the hotel after their conversation the previous night, so she goes for a walk on her own on the Sunset Trail. Tommy returns to the hotel, learns where Cynthia has gone, and sets off after her on the trail. Meanwhile, Bob telephones the hotel and leaves a message indicating that he will be arriving the following morning. Tommy finds Cynthia and they proceed to walk together until they come across a tree with initials engraved on it. Cynthia tells Tommy that she loves him as well, but wants to give her marriage to Bob a chance, and lets him know that once they get back to the hotel, they should say their goodbyes and never see each other again. However, on the return trip, they lose their way and are forced to spend the night in the woods. | The next morning, Bob arrives and finds that his wife isn't anywhere in the hotel. When they do return, Tommy tries to explain their disappearance, while Bob realizes that the two are in love. He becomes angry with Cynthia, and announces he wants an annulment after Cynthia admits that she fell in love with Tommy. Bob calls his lawyer, he finds out that he was never actually divorced from his previous wife. Tommy leaves to become an instructor at Darwin Field, and Cynthia returns home to her aunt and uncle. Nils Knudsen (Lauritz Melchior) telephones Tommy, and later, the two arrive at Cynthia's house late at night with Dorsey and a contingent of his orchestra, where they serenade the Glenn house, as well as the rest of the neighborhood. Tommy lip-synches Knudsen's voice to a love song to Cynthia. Cynthia runs outside to Tommy, and the two share a kiss while Knudsen continues singing, leaving Nona, and a bemused Hobart, to wonder how Tommy can sing and kiss at the same time.","m_cast":"Esther Williams as Cynthia Glenn | Van Johnson as Major Thomas Milvaine | Carleton G.

MGM described the film as \"primarily a human comedy with musical trimmings\".[4] Johnson's casting was announced in March 1944.[5] Robert Z. Leonard was meant to direct but he fell ill so Richard Thorpe took over.[6] | When attempting to create the right shade of blue for the swimming pool, the set decorator discovered that the paint he had used to color the cement had dissolved after adding the chlorine to the pool, creating a mess with the consistency of homogenized milk. The pool had to be drained and refilled.[7] | In her autobiography, Williams said that the studio attempted to put her and costar Van Johnson together in public as much as possible, even though she was involved with future husband (and ex-husband) Ben Gage. When asked why they didn't date, Johnson replied \"because I'm afraid she can't get her webbed feet into a pair of evening sandals.\" [7] | While filming, Williams and Thorpe rarely got along. After Williams forgot several lines during one take and the cast and crew began to leave for lunch, Williams notified Thorpe of her mistake. He called the entire crew back to the stage, saying \"Turn the lights back on, boys. This lady wants to act.\" Williams locked herself in her dressing room for the rest of the day. After that episode, Thorpe stopped picking on her.[7] | When filming the backstroke scenes in the swimming pool, Williams had to place her hand under Johnson's back to keep him afloat.[7] | The Office of War Information voiced concern that the film, set in an elegant resort, would pose problems with overseas distribution. A memo from the agency claimed that films boasting of American opulence would be resented by the allies closer to the fighting front.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Richard Thorpe","m_produced_by":"Joe Pasternak","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Van Johnson Esther Williams Frances Gifford Carleton G.
