The Beatles In The U.S.A., about the Beatles' first visit to America in February 1964. It documents the Beatles' US trip as they travel to New York City, Washington, DC, and Miami Beach. Footage of the Beatles (often acting irreverently in front of the camera) in hotel rooms makes up the majority of the non-musical portion of the film. | The main difference between the original 1964 documentary and the 1991 re-edited version is that 22 minutes[3] of the Beatles' live recorded performances on The Ed Sullivan Show have been inserted the 1991 release. However, as the 1964 documentary is 81 minutes long[4] and the 1991 version is 83 minutes,[5] some 20 minutes of the 1964 documentary have been excluded, such as several scenes with Brian Epstein.[6] | The original 1964 documentary is still being shown at various festivals, such as the Silverdocs in 2008,[7] and was also shown at a special screening at the Maysles Cinema in New York on 18 November 2011 in honour of Albert Maysles' 85th birthday.[8] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"Article about the film on the Beatles official website | The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit At the IMDB | Article in Huffington Post about the 1964 documentary Retrieved 2012-01-28","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/First_US_Visit.jpg/220px-First_US_Visit.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
