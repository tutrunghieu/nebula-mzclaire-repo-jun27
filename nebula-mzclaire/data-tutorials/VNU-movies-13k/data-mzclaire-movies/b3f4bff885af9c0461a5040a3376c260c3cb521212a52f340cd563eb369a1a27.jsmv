The film follows the hero through the four and half years he spent behind bars. While in prison, the film portrays Liddy as capable and able to match up to any man in the prison. The film includes several famous details from Liddy's 1980 autobiography including the legendary \"hand held over the burning flame,\" and Liddy's oath, \"I will kill for you, Mr. President.\"[2]","m_cast":"John Byner as voice of Richard Nixon. | Robert Conrad as G.

While O'Connor praised Lieberman, screenwriter Frank Abatemarco and Conrad, he questioned the overall purpose of the film. He rebuked Liddy, stating, \"What purpose is ultimately served? The basic criterion seems to be that it sells, enabling various companies and individuals, including Mr. Liddy, to make some money\" and comparing it with a CBS television movie about Charles Manson and the Manson Family murders. Noting that the source for the film was an autobiography, he went on to pan the producers as \"ambivalent\" toward the film's subject. O'Connor concluded his review by noting the film's attempt to gloss over the darker parts of Liddy's history: \"After a while, it gets increasingly difficult to remember that this law-and-order fanatic is not beyond putting himself above the law, that he seems to exist in a world of absurd macho fantasy (his book refers to 'my best Effrem Zimbalist Jr. (sic) manner' or 'I gave him Broderick Crawford in Highway Patrol'), and that his basic social and political instincts are fascistic.\"[1] | In the September/October 2004 issue of Washington Free Press Dr. John Ruhland included the film on a list of \"Rad Videos\" summarized as \"Dirty Politics in the United States.\" He called the film a \"campy and terribly acted account of the Watergate break-in.\" He noted the film's value as a tool for giving a view into the workings of the United States government.[8]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Lieberman","m_produced_by":"Joan Conrad John Ashley","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Robert Conrad John Mahoney Danny Lloyd","m_music_by":"Mike Post Pete Carpenter","m_cinematography":"Paul Vom Brack","m_edited_by":"Howard S.
