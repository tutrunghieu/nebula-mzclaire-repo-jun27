{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Arizonians Terry (Patricia Morrow), Sylvia (Lory Patrick), and Junior (Jackie DeShannon) drive to California’s Malibu Beach to vacation, to learn how to surf, and to look up Terry's brother \"Skeet,\" Malibu’s Big Kahuna bad boy (and a former football star whose career was ended with a skull injury). | While the girls are learning to surf, Terry falls in love with Len (Bobby Vinton), the operator of a local surf shop; Junior falls in love with Milo (Ken Miller), a new surfer; and Sylvia falls in love with Skeet (Jerry Summers). | Milo takes the girls to Casey’s Surfer, the hangout on the pier where the surfers and their ilk gather. While the girls get into the club on the virtue that Terry is Skeet’s sister, Milo is kept out because he is just a \"gremmie\". | In an effort to qualify for membership into Skeet’s unruly surfing club (called \"The Lodge\"), Milo attempts to \"shoot the pier\" (surfing through the pier - called \"run the pier\" in the film) and is injured when he smacks into one of the posts. As a result of Milo’s smash-up, Len gets into an argument with Skeet, and just as they are about to fight, Terry warns Len that Skeet's football injury is still dangerous. Throughout all the proceedings, Sgt. Wayne Neal (Richard Crane), the decidedly \"anti-surf\" police sergeant, is on Skeet’s back, waiting for him to screw up so he can either throw him in jail or out of town. Terry soon learns that her brother’s reputation is greater than the reality. | Skeet is further humiliated when he throws a party and Pauline (Martha Stewart) - the wealthy older woman who apparently owns the beach house that Skeet has been living in - finds him in her bedroom with Sylvia. Pauline reveals that Skeet is indeed a \"kept man\". To the delight of Sgt. Neal, Skeet decides to return to Arizona with Sylvia when he realizes how much he loves her; and the girls enjoy the rest of the vacation with their boyfriends.","m_cast":"Bobby Vinton as Len Marshal | Patricia Morrow as Terry Wells | Jackie DeShannon as Junior Griffith | Ken Miller as Milo Talbot (as Kenny Miller) | Lory Patrick as Sylvia Dempster | Richard Crane as Sgt.

Legendary surfer Mickey Dora doesn’t have a speaking role, but is a featured extra in a sequence in the Casey’s Surfer restaurant – playing the bowling-shirted surfer who follows Skeet’s signal to lead the crowd in a clap-out. | The Astronauts was a Boulder, Colorado-based surf band [2] who had a Billboard Top 100 hit in 1963 with their song \"Baja.\" They also appeared in Dexter’s later beach party movie, Wild on the Beach, as well as two other beach party films, Wild Wild Winter and Out of Sight – more than any other surf band. | The Routers was a band formed by Mike Gordon, whose first release in September 1962 was \"Let's Go (Pony)\", which reached # 19 on the Billboard charts. Gordon, who also formed The Marketts and wrote their million seller \"Out Of Limits\" Billboard charts and \"Surfer's Stomp\" Billboard charts which was one of the first successful surf songs released ion 1961. The Routers toured for over six years, in part from the popularity of the film and the songs that were included in the film.[3] | In addition to appearing as extras, surfers Mickey Dora and Johnny Fain, who appeared in several of AIP’s beach party films, performed the surfing stunts for this film. | The pier featured throughout the film is the historic 1905 Malibu Pier near Surfrider Beach. The exterior of \"Casey’s Surfer\" on the pier is the westernmost of the two wood-sided white buildings with royal blue trim at the beachward end of the pier. Originally called Alice's, the restaurant and bar was also operated as the Beachcomber Café from 2008 to 2012.[4][5] \"Len’s Surf Shop\" was situated in Malibu, west of the pier, near the intersection of Malibu Road and Webb Way, at 23651 Malibu Road.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Maury Dexter","m_produced_by":"Maury Dexter \"By\" Dunham","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Bobby Vinton Patricia Morrow Jackie DeShannon Ken Miller","m_music_by":"Jimmie Haskell","m_cinematography":"Kay Norton","m_edited_by":"Jodie Copelan","m_production_company":"Associated Producers (API)","m_distributed_by":"Twentieth Century-Fox","m_release_dates":"January 30, 1964 (1964-01-30)","m_running_time":"68 min.","m_country":"U.S.","m_language":"English | Surf Party is a 1964 beach party film directed by Maury Dexter.
