It was directed by Mark Rosman, written by Mark Rosman, produced by Alan Shapiro and Annette Handley, and starred Peter Coyote, Huckleberry Fox, Art Carney, Dennis Lipscomb and Joe Flood. The film tells the story of Jonathan Knicks (Fox), an 11-year-old who travels back in time from 1985 to 1927 by a time machine built by his neighbor Henry Coogan (Carney) from the theoretical blue prints of Johnathan's own grandfather. There Jonathan meets his less than illustrious grandfather, Max (Coyote), and desperately must find a way to prevent Max's fatal attempt at a solo trans-Atlantic flight and henceforth invariably change the course of history in the process.","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Blue Yonder at the Internet Movie Database | ","m_poster":null,"m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Mark Rosman"}
