{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A power struggle ensues after the death of media magnate Amos Kyne (Robert Warick), who turned his corporation over to his sole heir, foppish son Walter (Vincent Price). Rather than run the company himself, Walter decides to let the heads of its three divisions fight it out. Their assignment is to score an exclusive story on a serial killer terrorizing women in New York City the Kyne organization's newspaper dubs \"The Lipstick Killer\". Whoever identifies him before the police will be rewarded the title of Executive Director. | One of the three, newspaper editor Jon Day Griffith (Thomas Mitchell), has an ally in high-profile Kyne reporter and television personality Edward Mobley (Dana Andrews). While wire-service chief Mark Loving (George Sanders) recruits star writer Mildred Donner (Ida Lupino) as eyes and ears, a third contender, Harry Kritzer (James Craig), carries on a secret affair with Walter Kyne's wife Dorothy (Rhonda Fleming). | Mobley becomes engaged to Loving's secretary, Nancy Liggett (Sally Forrest). Receiving inside information from his police friend Lt. Kaufman (Howard Duff), Mobley taunts the killer on TV using Nancy as bait. | In the end, the lives of Nancy and Dorothy, who live across the hall from one another (since Dorothy happens to rent a discreet apartment in the same building to be able to carry out the affair with Harry), are placed in serious danger. While one of the three contenders for the Executive Director's job wins the contest, another has a surprise in store.","m_cast":"Dana Andrews as Edward Mobley | Rhonda Fleming as Dorothy Kyne | George Sanders as Mark Loving | Howard Duff as Lt.

He wrote: \"Since it is full of sound and fury, murder, sacred and profane love and a fair quota of intramural intrigue, a viewer is left wondering if the tycoons of the giant Kyne publishing combine ever bother to cover such mundane stories as the weather. But while this journalistic jamboree is more flamboyant than probable, a tight and sophisticated script by Casey Robinson and a clutch of professional performances make While the City Sleeps a diverting and workmanlike fiction.\"[6] | Time Out film reviews wrote of the film, \"Lang makes inspired use of glass-walled offices, where all is seen and nothing revealed, and traces explicit parallels between Andrews and the murderer. Lang's most underrated movie.\"[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the novel The Bloody Spur  by Charles Einstein","m_directed_by":"Fritz Lang","m_produced_by":"Bert E.
