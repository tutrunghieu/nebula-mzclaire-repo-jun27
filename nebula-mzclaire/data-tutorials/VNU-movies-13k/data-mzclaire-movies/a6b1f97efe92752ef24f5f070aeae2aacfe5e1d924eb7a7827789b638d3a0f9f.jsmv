{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Wiz was the eighth feature film produced by Motown Productions, the film/TV division of Berry Gordy's Motown Records label. Gordy originally wanted the teenaged future R&B singer Stephanie Mills, who had played the role on Broadway, to be cast as Dorothy. When Motown star Diana Ross asked Gordy if she could be cast as Dorothy, he declined, saying that Ross—then 33 years old—was too old for the role.[9] Ross went around Gordy and convinced executive producer Rob Cohen at Universal Pictures to arrange a deal where he would produce the film if Ross was cast as Dorothy. Gordy and Cohen agreed to the deal. Pauline Kael, a film critic, described Ross's efforts to get the film into production as \"perhaps the strongest example of sheer will in film history.\"[9] | After film director John Badham learned that Ross was going to play the part of Dorothy, he decided not to direct the film, and Cohen replaced him with Sidney Lumet.[9] Of his decision not to direct The Wiz, John Badham recalled telling Cohen that he thought Ross was \"a wonderful singer. She's a terrific actress and a great dancer, but she's not this character. She's not the little six-year-old girl Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.\"[10] Though 20th Century Fox had financially backed the stage musical, they ended up exercising their first refusal rights to the film production, which gave Universal an opening to finance the film.[11] Initially, Universal was so excited about the film's prospects that they did not set a budget for production.[11] | Joel Schumacher's script for The Wiz was influenced by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training (\"est\") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were \"very enamored of Werner Erhard\".[12] \"Before I knew it,\" said Rob Cohen, \"the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing who you are and sharing and all that. I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with [Ross] because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars.\"[12] Schumacher spoke positively of the results of the est training, stating that he was \"eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life.\"[12] However, he also complained that \"everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull****.\"[12] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was \"a litany of est-like platitudes\", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song \"Believe in Yourself\".[12] Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.[13] | During production, Lumet felt that the finished film would be \"an absolutely unique experience that nobody has ever witnessed before.\"[11] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that \"there was nothing to be gained from [the 1939 film] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it. They made a brilliant movie, and even though our concept is different – they're Kansas, we're New York; they're white, we're black, and the score and the books are totally different – we wanted to make sure that we never overlapped in any area.\"[11] | Michael Jackson, a former Motown star who by the start of development on The Wiz in 1977, had left Motown for Epic Records with his brothers The Jacksons, was cast as the Scarecrow. Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs, and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part.[14] Ted Ross and Mabel King were brought in to reprise their respective roles from the stage musical, while Nipsey Russell was cast as the Tin Man. Lena Horne, mother-in-law to Sidney Lumet during the time of production, was cast as Glinda the Good Witch, and comedian Richard Pryor portrayed The Wiz.[9][15] | The Wiz was filmed at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The decaying New York State Pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair was used as the set for Munchkinland, Astroland at Coney Island was used for the Tinman scene with The Cyclone as a backdrop, while the World Trade Center served as the Emerald City.[16] The scenes filmed at the Emerald City were elaborate, utilizing 650 dancers, 385 crew members and 1,200 costumes.[16][17] Costume designer Tony Walton enlisted the help of high fashion designers in New York City for the Emerald City sequence, and obtained exotic costumes and fabric from designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Norma Kamali.[15] Albert Whitlock created the film's visual special effects,[11] while Stan Winston served as the head makeup artist.[15] | Quincy Jones was the musical supervisor and music producer for the film.[14] He later wrote that he initially did not want to work on the film, but did it as a favor to Sidney Lumet.[14] The film production marked Jones' first time working with Michael Jackson, and Jones would later produce three hit albums for Jackson: Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad.[18] Jones recalled working with Jackson as one of his favorite experiences from The Wiz, and spoke of Jackson's dedication to his role, comparing his acting style to Sammy Davis, Jr.[14] Jones had a brief cameo during the \"Gold\" segment of the Emerald City sequence, playing what looks like a fifty-foot grand piano.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L.

An urban reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an entirely African-American cast, The Wiz was loosely adapted from the 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. The film follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy twenty-four-year-old Harlem, New York City, schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles an alternative fantasy version of the Big Apple. Befriended by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious Wiz, who they say is the only one powerful enough to send her home. | Produced by Rob Cohen and directed by Sidney Lumet, The Wiz stars Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, Ted Ross, Mabel King, Theresa Merritt, Thelma Carpenter, Lena Horne, and Richard Pryor. The film's story was reworked from William F. Brown's Broadway libretto by Joel Schumacher, and Quincy Jones supervised the adaptation of Charlie Smalls and Luther Vandross's songs for film. A handful of new songs, written by Jones and the songwriting team of Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, were added for the film version. Upon its original theatrical release, The Wiz was a critical and commercial failure, and marked the end of the resurgence of African-American films that began with the blaxploitation movement of the early 1970s.[3][4][5] Despite its initial failure, the film version of The Wiz became a cult classic, particularly among African-American audiences, Oz enthusiasts, and fans of Michael Jackson.[6][7] Certain aspects of this film adaptation influenced the The Wiz Live!, a live television adaptation of the musical.[8] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d Sharp, Kathleen (2003).
