{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"There are three main heroes in this movie: Vera, a waitress; Platon, a pianist; and... a train station where these two people met. The differences in the heroes’ characters and professions, the plight that Platon found himself in (he is to be arrested and undergo trial) trigger a host of both amusing and sad situations which serve as a backdrop for their unfolding love. Platon is innocent of the crime he is accused of. He simply took the blame for his wife’s driving over a pedestrian. But this is known only to Platon’s wife and Vera in whom he confided. However, after the verdict has been passed, Platon’s life is of no interest to his wife, although Vera is ready to wait for his release.","m_cast":"Lyudmila Gurchenko as Vera | Oleg Basilashvili as Platon Ryabinin | Nikita Mikhalkov as Andrey | Nonna Mordyukova as Uncle Misha | Mikhail Kononov as Nikolasha | Anastasiya Voznesenskaya as Yuliya | Aleksandr Shirvindt as Shurik | Tatyana Dogileva as Marina | Olga Volkova as Violetta, waitress | Raisa Etush as Lyuda, waitress | Viktor Bortsov as drunken visitor restaurant | Anatoli Skoryakin as commandant | Stanislav Sadalsky as man with a carburetor | Alla Budnitskaya as Masha, Platon’s wife | Eldar Ryazanov as Railroad Supervisor","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Eldar Ryazanov","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Lyudmila Gurchenko Oleg Basilashvili Nikita Mikhalkov Nonna Mordyukova Mikhail Kononov","m_music_by":"Andrei Petrov","m_cinematography":"Vadim Alisov","m_edited_by":"Valeriya Belova","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Mosfilm","m_release_dates":"1982","m_running_time":"141 min.","m_country":"Soviet Union","m_language":"Russian | Station for Two (Russian: Вокзал для двоих, Vokzal dlya dvoikh) is a 1982 melodramatic and comedic love story.
