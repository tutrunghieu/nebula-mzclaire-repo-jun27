It also features Glynis Barber and Emma Samms in their early performances. The story of an alcoholic ex-footballer attempting a comeback with the Saints who are owned by a wealthy pop star. When a striker gets injured, Turner (McShane) is signed by the third division team and helps to get them to Wembley where they play 'Leicester Forest' in the final. But can he stop drinking and make it to the final?. The screenplay was written by novelist Jackie Collins, but was an original work and not based on one of her books. Though it bears a striking resemblance to the life of the former player George Best, the film is not biographical. The cup final at Wembley uses footage from the Southampton v Nottingham Forest league Cup Final.
