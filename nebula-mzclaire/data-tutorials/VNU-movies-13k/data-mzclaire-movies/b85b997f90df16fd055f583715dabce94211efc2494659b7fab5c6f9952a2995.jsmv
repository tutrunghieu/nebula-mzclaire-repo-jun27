{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The setting is Germany in the late 18th century. Mytyl (Shirley Temple), the bratty daughter of a woodcutter (Russell Hicks), finds a unique bird in the Royal Forest and selfishly refuses to give it to her sick friend. Mother (Spring Byington) and Father are mortified at Mytyl's behavior. That evening, Father is called on to report for duty the next morning in an unspecified war. That same night, Mytyl is visited in a dream by a fairy named Berylune (Jessie Ralph) who sends her and her brother Tyltyl (Johnny Russell) to search for the Blue Bird of Happiness. To accompany them, the fairy magically transforms their dog Tylo (Eddie Collins), cat Tylette (Gale Sondergaard), and lantern (\"Light\") into human form. The children have a number of adventures: they visiting the past (meeting their dead grandparents who come to life because they are being remembered), have a scary adventure in the forest, experience the life of luxury, and see the future, a land of yet-to-be born children. The dream journey makes Mytyl awake as a kinder and gentler girl who has learned to appreciate all the comforts and joys of her home and family. In the morning, Father receives word that a truce has been called and he does not have to go to war. | The film, although following the basic plot of the stage version, highly embellishes it, and does not literally use the original dialogue. The opening black-and-white scenes and the war subplot were invented for the film. Mytyl's selfishness, the basic trait of her personality, was a plot thread specifically written into the motion picture. It is not in the original play. | The play begins with the children already asleep and the dream about to begin. There is absolutely no depiction of the family's daily life, as there is in the 1940 film.","m_cast":"Shirley Temple as Mytyl | Spring Byington as Mummy Tyl | Nigel Bruce as Mr. Luxury | Gale Sondergaard as Tylette (the cat) | Eddie Collins as Tylo (the dog) | Sybil Jason as Angela Berlingot | Helen Ericson as Light | Johnny Russell as Tytyl | Laura Hope Crews as Mrs. Luxury | Russell Hicks as Daddy Tyl | Cecilia Loftus as Granny Tyl | Al Shean as Grandpa Tyl | Leona Roberts as Mrs. Berlingyl | Gene Reynolds as Studious Boy | Stanley Andrews as Wilhelm | Alice Armand as Weeping Willow | Sterling Holloway as Wild Plum | Thurston Hall as Father Time | Frank Dawson as Caller of the Roll | Edwin Maxwell as Oak | Four-year-old Caryll Ann Ekelund (credited as Caryll N. Ekelund),[not in citation given] appears as an unborn child in the film.[1] On Halloween 1939, Ekelund's costume caught fire from a lit jack-o-lantern. She died from her burns [2] several days later and was buried in her costume from the film.[citation needed] Ekelund came from a show business family, and her older sister was actress Jana Lund.[3]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Twentieth Century-Fox made the film as an answer to MGM's The Wizard of Oz. There is a myth that Shirley Temple was to be cast in Oz, however this is mostly untrue. She was considered, but only very briefly. Executives at MGM wanted Shirley because she was a proven box office draw. Arthur Freed, an uncredited producer on Oz, wanted the role to go to rising child star Judy Garland. When producers listened to Shirley, they were unimpressed with her vocal talents, and even if they were ready to offer the role Fox refused to loan her out. When Oz was a success, and shot Judy Garland to fame, Fox decided to create their own fantasy feature using Shirley Temple. They chose the fantasy play by Maurice Maeterlinck. | In imitation of The Wizard of Oz, the opening scenes are in black-and-white, although the opening credits are in color. However, sepia tint is not used. But unlike Oz, once the film changes to full color it stays that way for the remainder of its running time. | While writing the screenplay, Zanuck decided to drop some of the characters in the original story such as Bread, Water, Fire, and Cold in the Head as their scenes did not involve Temple's character and he wanted the story more focused on her as the star of the movie. It was decided to cast the role of Temple's brother to the much younger Johnny Russell, as Zanuck felt that in casting a boy of a similar age to Temple he would have to be mentally incompetent to allow a girl to take leadership away from him. The tension between the Temples and Zanuck reached a boiling point during the writing stage, as Temple's mother objected first to Temple's characterization as too nice then had concerns about the script not being focused enough on Temple. Things came to a head when Zanuck threatened suspension. After consulting their lawyer, the Temples decided to go forward with the movie as planned.[4] | The Blue Bird was Shirley Temple's first box-office flop in her 6 years as a child star. Audiences disliked the idea of Shirley as a nasty character needing to learn a lesson. While many of Temple's films show her character misbehaving in various ways, this is the only one to show her being truly punished. Early in the film, her brattiness earns her a reprimand from her mother. | Almost a month prior to the film's release, The Blue Bird was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on the December 24, 1939, broadcast of The Screen Guild Theater, starring Shirley Temple and Nelson Eddy. It was during this radio performance that a crazed woman made an attempt on Temple's life. As Temple was singing \"Someday You'll Find Your Bluebird,\" the woman arose from her seat and pulled out a handgun, pointing it directly at her. The woman froze however just long enough for police to get to her. It was later discovered that the woman had lost a child on the day it was publicly stated that Temple was born and she blamed her for stealing her daughter's soul. What the woman did not know however was that Temple was born in 1928, not 1929.[5] Running Time 82 Minutes and 46 seconds","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Walter Lang","m_produced_by":"Darryl F.
