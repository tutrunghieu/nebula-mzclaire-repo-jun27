Tagore on seeing his students suffer, surrenders to the police and requests the Indian police to release his students. . The rising support for Tagore makes the Chief Minister to meet him for higher appeal.

Tagore gives a speech in the court explaining what a student power the country has but corruption is what is letting it down.
