{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Waikiki Brothers is a band going nowhere. After another depressing gig, the saxophonist quits, leaving the three remaining members - lead singer and guitarist Sung-woo (Lee Eol), keyboardist Jung-seok (Park Won-sang), and drummer Kang-soo (Hwang Jung-min), to continue on the road. The band ends up at Sung-woo's hometown, Suanbo, which was a popular hot spring resort in the '80s. The main resort now is the Waikiki Hotel, and their gig at the hotel nightclub starts well, until Jung-seok and Kang-soo start to play out their worst vices. For Sung-woo, the calm center of the band, the return home is filled with reservations of disappointments and a lost love. He reunites with his old high school friends, the original Waikiki Brothers, and finds them far from happy. He runs into In-hee (Oh Ji-hye), his unrequited first love. Now widowed, she seems desperate to try their relationship again. Sung-woo also runs into his old music teacher, Byung-joo, and tries to help him get work. But the band is fired from the nightclub and Sung-woo is forced to perform in karaoke bars. And, then, tragedy strikes when his high school classmate Soo-chul dies in an accident.","m_cast":"Lee Eol - Sung-woo | Park Won-sang - Jung-seok | Hwang Jung-min - Kang-soo | Oh Kwang-rok - Hyun-gu | Oh Ji-hye - In-hee | Ryoo Seung-bum - Gi-tae | Park Hae-il - young Sung-woo | Kim Jong-eon - young Soo-chul | Jung Dae-yong - Min-soo | Moon Hye-won - young In-hee | Joo Jin-mo - man selling items at rest area | Lee Dong-yong - Busan bum 1 | Lee Min-ho - young In-ki | Lee Bong-kyu - manager | Han Ki-joong - Min-soo","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Yim Soon-rye","m_produced_by":"Lee Eun Shin Jae-myung","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Lee Eol Park Won-sang Hwang Jung-min","m_music_by":"Choi Sun-sik","m_cinematography":"Choi Gi-yeol","m_edited_by":"Kim Sang-bum","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"October 27, 2001 (2001-10-27) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"109 minutes","m_country":"South Korea","m_language":"Korean | Waikiki Brothers is a 2001 South Korean film, set in the 1980s, about a group of high school friends who form a band.
