{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Late night in a bar in present day, an old man enters and awaits service, and not long after, a group of thugs arrive and attempt to rob the till. The old man defeats them easily one by one with hand-to-hand combat. Amazed, the bartender asks how he learned to fight. The old man replies \"it was long ago...\" | Christopher Dubois (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a pickpocket in his mid-twenties living in 1925 New York. Orphaned as a child, Dubois looks after a large group of young orphans by performing cons and stealing. After stealing a large sum of money from a group of gangsters, Dubois and the children are found by the gangsters. Dubois is able to subdue the gangsters, but the struggle draws the attention of the police. After promising to return to the children, Dubois escapes the police by stowing away on a boat. He is found out by the crew and imprisoned by gun smugglers and pirates and forced into physical labor. Eventually, the crew decides Dubois is no longer needed, but before he can be killed, the pirate ship is attacked and boarded by a mercenary Englishman, Lord Edgar Dobbs (Roger Moore). After saving each other's lives, Dobbs agrees to help Dubois return home, but deceives him and sells Dubois into slavery on an island near Siam, where Dubois is trained in Muay Thai fighting. | After six months, Dobbs and his partner Harri Smythe (Jack McGee) find Dubois fighting in a Muay Thai match and see that he has become a skilled fighter. Dobbs later assists (and exploits) Dubois, buying his freedom so the now-expert fighter can represent the U.S in a Kumite like tournament called the Ghang-gheng, held in the Lost City of Tibet, where representatives of Germany, Soviet Union, Scotland, Spain, Turkey, Brazil, Korea, Siam, Greece, France, China, Japan, Okinawa, Africa, and Mongolia fight in elimination bouts, and the winner of the tournament receives a valuable statue, the Golden Dragon. Along for the journey are American reporter Carrie Newton (Janet Gunn) and heavyweight boxing champion Maxie Devine (James Remar). | Dubois ultimately wins the tournament by defeating the representative of Mongolia and he is given a medal and proclaimed the greatest fighter, but does not accept the Golden Dragon. Instead he trades it for the lives of Dobbs and his comrade Harri, who were sentenced to death for trying to steal the Golden Dragon. | Back in the bar, Dubois explains he returned to New York and helped the children get off the streets. Ultimately, things turned out for the best. Devine helped to train many great fighters, while Dobbs and Harri opened a trading post deep in the Amazon. In the final scene, a book closes, revealing its title, 'The Quest', and that it was written by Carrie Newton.","m_cast":"Jean-Claude Van Damme as Christopher Dubois | Roger Moore as Lord Edgar Dobbs | James Remar as Maxie Devine | Janet Gunn as Carrie Newton | Jack McGee as Harri Smythe | Aki Aleong as Khao | Abdel Qissi as Khan (Mongolia) | Stefanos Miltsakakis as Greek Fighter | Ong Soo Han as Korean Fighter | Louis Mandylor as Riggi | Chang Ching Peng Chaplin as Master Tchi | Ryan Cutrona as Officer O'Keefe | Peter Wong as Chinese fighter (Shaolin) | Kitao as Japanese fighter (sumo) | César Carneiro as Brazilian fighter (Capoeira) | MarkAnthony Baca - Stuntman[3]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"It was filmed in Bangkok, Phuket, Thailand and Montreal, Quebec, Canada, over 77 days, from March 1 to May 17, 1995.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","m_produced_by":"Moshe Diamant","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":"Frank Dux Jean-Claude Van Damme","m_starring":"Jean-Claude Van Damme Roger Moore James Remar Janet Gunn","m_music_by":"Randy Edelman","m_cinematography":"David Gribble","m_edited_by":"John F.
