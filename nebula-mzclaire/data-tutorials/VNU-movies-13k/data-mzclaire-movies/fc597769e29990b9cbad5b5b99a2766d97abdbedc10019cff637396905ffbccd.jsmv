{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as \"Creators\" invade prehistoric Earth, wiping out most of life on the planet with \"Seeds.\" In the present, Darcy Tirrel discovered frozen dinosaur corpses in the Arctic covered with a mysterious metal. | Five years after the Battle of Chicago, public opinions have become fearful for all Transformers and the US government has terminated all joint operations with the Autobots. Cemetery Wind, an elite CIA Black Ops division formed by opportunistic government official and CIA Director Harold Attinger, was formed to destroy the remaining Decepticons left on Earth. Secretly. However, they've been hunting down Autobots as well, believing that all Transformers are a threat, despite the Autobots officially being granted sanctuary by the government. During this time, Cemetery Wind, aided by Lockdown, a Cybertronian bounty hunter who is hunting down Optimus Prime for unknown reasons, tracks down and mortally wounds Ratchet, who is then killed by Lockdown after refusing to expose Optimus' whereabouts. | In Texas, a financially struggling inventor, Cade Yeager and his friend, Lucas Flannery, discover an old truck in an abandoned theater and they buy it to repair and sell it for Cade's daughter, Tessa and her college funds. Cade discovers that the truck is an injured Optimus Prime and repairs him, bringing him back to life. Cemetery Wind leader, James Savoy and his militants threaten the Yeagers and Lucas before Optimus attacks and rescues them. Cade, Tessa and Lucas escape with Tessa's secret boyfriend, Shane Dyson, but after a lengthy chase, Lucas is killed by Lockdown's grenade. Tensions rise between Cade and the two lovers over their secret relationship while Optimus rallies with remaining Autobots, Bumblebee, Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs in the desert. Cade hacks into a spy drone he took from the Texas attack, learning of Kinetic Solutions Incorporated (KSI), a technology firm in league with Cemetery Wind, and they decide to infiltrate KSI HQ in Chicago. | Meanwhile, ambitious KSI founder Joshua Joyce shows Transformium (the scarce metal of which Transformers are made) to Darcy. He has imprisoned Brains to decode dead and fallen Transformers' minds for raw materials and utilize their data for human-created Transformers \"upgrades\". Joshua shows Darcy his prized creation Galvatron, created from the data from the dead Transformers, specifically Megatron's remains. The Autobots, observing the company through Cade's drone, angrily storm the facility, but Joshua stops them, proclaiming the Autobots are no longer needed now that they can create their own Transformers. Disillusioned, the Autobots leave the facility. | Forced by Attinger, Joshua launches Galvatron and Stinger (an artificial Transformer identical to Bumblebee) to pursue and hunt down the Autobots. Optimus fights Galvatron, who becomes autonomous from the humans, but the fight is cut short when Lockdown disables Optimus, capturing him and Tessa onto his ship; Lockdown reveals that the Creators want Optimus back. Before leaving, Lockdown moves his ship into downtown Chicago to give Savoy the Seed, allowing the Autobots to board the ship and mount a rescue. Cade and Shane save Tessa and escape with Bumblebee and Crosshairs while Hound and Drift escape with Optimus on a detachable part of Lockdown's ship. Meanwhile, Joshua decides to retreat to China for production facilities with Su Yueming, while Optimus and Brains explain to Cade that Galvatron is actually the reincarnated Megatron who has been plotting to steal the Seed so he can rebuild his Decepticon army. Cade contacts Joshua and warns him about Galvatron and Attinger. With a change of heart, Joshua backs off his deal with Attinger after knowing of the latter's true intentions. But as the two come to an argument, Galvatron activates himself and infects all the KSI prototypes into Decepticons while Joshua flees with the Seed to Hong Kong, with a betrayed Attinger and Galvatron chasing after him. | When the Autobots try to retrieve the Seed at Hong Kong, their ship is shot down by the Vehicons, leaving the Yeagers, Shane, Hound and Bumblebee to fight. Cade and Savoy engage in a fight, which ends in Savoy falling to his death. Attinger contacts Lockdown for the Autobots' current location, where the KSI Decepticons are overwhelming the Autobots. Knowing this, Optimus releases and tames the Dinobots. With their help, the Autobots eliminate the Vehicons, with Bumblebee killing Stinger. Imminently afterwards, Lockdown returns with a magnetic weapon to reclaim Optimus and the Dinobots. Optimus destroys the magnetic weapon before confronting Lockdown. | As Optimus fights Lockdown, Cade arrives to help but is confronted by Attinger at gunpoint. Witnessing this, Optimus saves Cade by shooting Attinger, killing him as he promised earlier on, but the distraction allows Lockdown to impale Optimus with his sword to a wall. Cade and Bumblebee fight Lockdown while Tessa and Shade pull the sword out of Optimus, who then surprises and kills Lockdown before the latter could finish off Cade. Everyone escapes after using Lockdown's grenade to destroy the remaining KSI Decepticons while Galvatron retreats, and they reunite with the other Autobots, where Optimus sets the Dinobots free. Cade reconciles with Tessa and accepts Shane while Joyce makes amends with them. After asking the Autobots to protect the Yeagers, Optimus flies into space with the Seed, sending a message to the Creators that he is coming for them.","m_cast":"Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager, a single father and struggling inventor.[8] | Stanley Tucci as Joshua Joyce, the ambitiously arrogant head of KSI who wants to build his own Transformers.[9][10] | Kelsey Grammer as Harold Attinger, a paranoid CIA director and government official who created the Cemetery Wind to eliminate all Transformers, Autobot or Decepticon, from Earth.[11] | Nicola Peltz as Tessa Yeager, Cade's daughter who is secretly dating Shane. | Jack Reynor as Shane Dyson, Tessa's boyfriend and an Irish rally car driver.[12][13] | Titus Welliver as James Savoy, a ruthless CIA Agent and field leader of the Cemetery Wind working for Attinger.[14] | Sophia Myles as Darcy Tirrel, Joshua's geologist assistant.[15][16] | Li Bingbing as Su Yueming (苏月明 Sū Yuèmíng), owner of the Chinese factory used by KSI to build their artificial Transformers.[17] | T.

It earned $8.75 million from Thursday late-night run, which was the fifth biggest of 2014.[97] On Friday, the film grossed an additional $31.25 million bringing its total day gross to $41.6 million, which includes $10.7 million from IMAX theaters. In its opening weekend, the film earned $100,038,390[nb 1] setting an opening record of 2014 (overtaken by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 with $121.9 million),[100] which is the fourth-highest opening for Paramount,[101] and the fifth-highest for a film released in June.[102] The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25 (with 58%), male (64%) and under 18 (27%).[103] The film remained at the summit for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in its third weekend. It also cross the $200 million mark in its third weekend becoming the fifth film of 2014 to do so.[104][105] The film closed down its theatrical run on October 9, 2014[106] and earned a total of $245,439,076, making it the fifth highest-grossing film of 2014 but the lowest-grossing in the Transformers film series.[106][107] | Outside North America, it is the highest-grossing film of 2014,[108] and the sixth-highest-grossing film.[109] Transformers: Age of Extinction earned $202.1 million in its opening weekend from 37 countries in 10,152 screens, which is 35% bigger Transformers: Dark of the Moon and marking the biggest overseas opening of 2014 (breaking X-Men: Days of Future Past's record set one month prior).[110] It scored the biggest IMAX overseas opening weekend with $16.6 million from 266 theaters (overtaken by Jurassic World).[110][111] The film topped the box office outside North America for four consecutive weekends despite coinciding with the 2014 FIFA World Cup before being overtaken by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in its fifth weekend.[112] | International openings of over $5 million occurred in South Korea ($21.7 million), Brazil ($16.5 million), Germany ($11.2 million), Australia ($9.6 million),France ($8.8 million), Taiwan ($8.1 million), Malaysia ($6.7 million), Japan ($6.4 million), the Philippines ($5.7 million), India ($5.35 million), Hong Kong ($5.1 million) and Italy ($5 million).[110] In Russia, the film opened to number one with $21.7 million from 1,100 screens which is the second largest in the territory for which 3D accounted for 80% of the total gross. IMAX comprised $2.6 million of the total gross from 34 IMAX screens.[110] Its biggest opener outside the U.S. was in China, where it scored one of the biggest non-North American openings of all time with $91.2 million from 4,400 screens which was once the second biggest opening of all time there.[110][113] The film set an all time IMAX opening record with $9.7 million.[110][114] After five days of its release, the fourth Transformers movie surpassed its North American run with $134.5 million.[115][116] In China, the film earned an additional $50.9 million in its second weekend for a total of $212.8 million. In only 10 days of its release, it became the highest-grossing film in China with $222.74 million, thus overtaking Avatar's previous record.[117][118][119] Adding to the film's revenue and popularity were product placements of Chinese brands edited into the movie specifically for Chinese audiences.[120] | It became the highest-grossing film in China, with $301–$320 million[nb 2] in revenue surpassing 2009's record set by Avatar ($204 million),[122][127][128] until it was surpassed by Furious 7 in 2015 over $390 million.[129] It is also the first movie in China to gross more than $300 million at the box office.[130] A large part of the success in China has been attributed to the large fan base there and because of its accompanying animated TV series–which ran during the 1980s and 1990–was one of the highest quality TV programs at that time which resulted in many children getting attached to it. Transformers toy merchandising was one of the first successful cases by a foreign company in China at its time, its line of transforming robot toys was highly sought after, especially by boys.[131] | At the end of its theatrical run outside North America, the film earned $858,600,000 which is 77.8% of its total gross. In total earnings, the highest revenue came from China ($301 million), Russia ($45.2 million), South Korea ($43.3 million), Germany ($38.2 million), Mexico ($33.5 million) and the UK ($33.1 million).[132] | The $100 million opening for Transformers: Age of Extinction is disputed within the industry. According to Rentrak—which has a direct line into the vast majority of theaters in the United States and Canada to track actual ticket sales—about 4,100 of the 4,233 theaters playing the film generated $95.9 million. The projected total from the Rentrak sales data would put the opening three-day weekend gross at around $97.5 million. For Transformers to have crossed the $100 million threshold, it would have needed to gross more than the nationwide average in the theaters not tracked by Rentrak. Some media outlets have elected to go with the Rentrak figure.[98][99] | On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a \"Rotten\" rating of 18% (the lowest rating for a Bay film), based on 181 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With the fourth installment in Michael Bay's blockbuster Transformers franchise, nothing is in disguise: Fans of loud, effects-driven action will find satisfaction, and all others need not apply.\"[133] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 32 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[134] In CinemaScore polls, users gave the film an \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale compared to the \"B+\" that the second film had scored and \"A\" for both the original and third movie.[135] | Richard Roeper gave the film a D, saying that: \"the longer the movie goes on, the less interesting it becomes; it just wears you down. As we were finally reaching the 165-minute mark, all that noise and fury was about as exciting as the special effects in an Ed Wood movie.\"[136] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film zero out of four stars, calling it \"the worst and most worthless Transformers movie yet.\"[137] Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that \"This series was never good, but it was once fun, or at least flashy. Now that its gears have gone rusty, it’s time for an Alien vs. Predator-style rethink.\"[138] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said in his review that: \"The story is scaffolding for the action, and like every other standing structure it is wrecked in a thunderous shower of metal, glass, masonry and earth.\"[139] | Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter commented on his review that it \"barely skirts the idea that humankind and planet Earth are about to be totally annihilated. What is extinguished is the audience's consciousness after being bombarded for nearly three hours with overwrought emotions ('There's a missile in the living room!' Tessa hollers — twice), bad one-liners and battles that rarely rise above the banal. A trio of editors make a technical marvel out of the fight scenes, but can do little to link the story's multiple threads into something coherent.\"[140] Roth Cornet of IGN gave the film a score of 6.3 out of 10, praising the slightly darker/surprising tone and Lockdown and his ship while criticizing the logic/script issues and long running time.[141] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film one out of five stars, commenting that \"If the 'human scenes' all reek of adolescent dialogue and dopey snark masquerading as character development, it's a toss-up if that's better or worse than seeing clattering collections of caliginous junk.\"[142] | Transformers: Age of Extinction was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and Blu-ray 3D formats on September 30, 2014, in North America.

According to Rentrak—which has a direct line into the vast majority of theaters in the United States and Canada to track actual ticket sales—about 4,100 of the 4,233 theaters playing the film generated $95.9 million. The projected total from the Rentrak sales data would put the opening three-day weekend gross at around $97.5 million. For Transformers to have crossed the $100 million threshold, it would have needed to gross more than the nation-wide average in the theaters not tracked by Rentrak. Some media outlets have elected to go with the Rentrak figure.[98][99] | ^ A final number on Transformers: Age of Extinction tends to vary between the Paramount reported $301 million and local data that rises it to $320 million.[121][122][123][124][125][126]","m_external_link":"Transformers: Age of Extinction at the Internet Movie Database | Transformers: Age of Extinction at the TCM Movie Database | Transformers: Age of Extinction at AllMovie","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Transformers_Age_of_Extinction_Poster.jpeg/220px-Transformers_Age_of_Extinction_Poster.jpeg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
