{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Possessing a reputation for bringing criminals to justice, ready-to-retire bounty hunter Jonathan Corbett (Lee Van Cleef) is summoned to a party by a Texas railroad tycoon by the name of Brockston (Walter Barnes), whose daughter is getting married. Brockston plants the seed that Corbett should consider a run for the Senate, but not before doing one last bounty hunt. | Brockston offers Corbett his political backing in exchange for tracking down a 12-year-old girl's accused rapist and murderer, who goes by the name of Cuchillo (Tomas Milian), a Mexican who is fleeing back to his native land. Cuchillo means “the knife” in Spanish, which is the rascal’s weapon of choice. Corbett expects it to be easy, even offering to do it as a wedding gift. | Corbett sets out in pursuit of Cuchillo, who is not as dumb as he acts, and who is rather crafty at vexing Corbett at every turn. As time passes and Corbett fails to get his man, Brockston turns to an Austrian, \"The Baron,\" who prides himself on being the fastest draw of any man with a gun, to settle scores with Cuchillo and, if necessary, with Corbett as well.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Sergio Sollima","m_produced_by":"Alberto Grimaldi","m_screenplay_by":"Sergio Donati Sergio Sollima","m_story_by":"Franco Solinas Fernando Morandi","m_starring":"Lee Van Cleef Tomas Milian Walter Barnes","m_music_by":"Ennio Morricone","m_cinematography":"Carlo Carlini","m_edited_by":"Gaby Peñalba","m_production_company":"Produzioni Europee Associati (PEA) Tulio Demicheli P.C.","m_distributed_by":"PEA (Italy) Columbia Pictures (US, theatrical) Grindhouse Releasing (US, Blu-ray/DVD)","m_release_dates":"29 November 1966 (Spain) 3 March 1967 (Italy)","m_running_time":"110 minutes (Italian) 89 minutes (US, theatrical) 95 minutes (US, Blu-ray/DVD)","m_country":"Italy Spain","m_language":"Italian English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"1,440,849,000 ITL (Italy)[1] | The Big Gundown (Italian: La resa dei conti, lit. The Settling of Scores) is a 1966 Italian Spaghetti Western thriller film, co-written by long-time Sergio Leone collaborator Sergio Donati, directed by Sergio Sollima, and starring Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Milian.[2] It was originally released by Columbia Pictures in the US as a double feature with A Time for Killing. | Some critics, such as Leonard Maltin, consider the film one of the finest spaghetti westerns, second only to Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. It was the first film Van Cleef made following The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and was his first leading man or hero role. Tomas Milian played Cuchillo, a charming rogue accused of rape and murder. Run, Man, Run! (1968) was a sequel which brought back Milian without Van Cleef. | It was important to Sergio Sollima that he tell a classic tale of a rich corrupt politician vs. a poor misunderstood peasant/scapegoat as a way of addressing the age old subject that, being Italian, he knew quite well living under the dictatorship of Mussolini during World War II. This film would actually share more with Leone's opus Once Upon a Time in the West than the Eastwood pictures. Each focuses on the modernizing of the West and the corrupt, rich businessmen that manipulated and used the poor.[3] The film was shot in Almería, Spain, where many famous Italian Westerns were filmed.[4] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Fisher, Austin (2014).
