{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with Phyllis (Diana Dors) telling her story in flashbacks. It begins how she meets rich vintner Paul Hochen (Rod Steiger) from Napa Valley in a bar and marries him soon after. | Not long after the marriage, Phyllis begins having an affair with a local rodeo rider, San Sanford (Tom Tryon), seeing him every time her husband is away, which is frequently. One night, her elderly mother-in-law (Beulah Bondi) thinks a burglar is breaking into the house, so she calls the police. Phyllis sees this as an opportunity to kill her husband and blame the burglar for the crime. The plan backfires a day later when she instead kills her husband's best friend. Not wanting to go to jail, she convinces her husband to confess to the killing and they concoct a story that would set him free after the trial. | Unfortunately for her husband, Phyllis lies at the trial and he is put away for murder. The \"unholy\" wife finally gets the punishment she deserves when her mother-in-law dies of poisoning and the blame goes to Phyllis, who is sent to prison—for a crime she had nothing to do with. Later, she faces her execution in the gas chamber. The film ends with Paul showing their son Michael (Gary Hunley) the vineyard that will someday be his.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The New York Times panned the film when it was released, writing, \"Indeed, this might be an excellent time for the actress to take inventory or choose a comedy (her real forte). For the new R. K. O. production and Universal-International release, teaming her with Rod Steiger, is a dull, unholy mess, and an absolute waste of anyone's time. Including, we might add, that of the two principals. Pretentiously tinted in garish color, and staged with coronation pomp by director-producer John Farrow, the picture is a hollow, tawdry little drama of frustration, violence and a loveless marriage in California's Napa Valley.\"[3]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the teleplay The Prowlers on Climax!  by William Durkee","m_directed_by":"John Farrow","m_produced_by":"John Farrow","m_screenplay_by":"Jonathan Latimer","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Diana Dors | Rod Steiger | Tom Tryon | Beulah Bondi","m_music_by":"Daniele Amfitheatrof","m_cinematography":"Lucien Ballard","m_edited_by":"Eda Warren","m_production_company":"RKO Radio Pictures John Farrow Productions","m_distributed_by":"Universal-International","m_release_dates":"October 1957 (1957-10) (United States) | March 6, 1958 (1958-03-06) (New York City, New York) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Unholy Wife is a 1957 Technicolor film noir crime film produced and directed by John Farrow at RKO Radio Pictures, but released by Universal-International as RKO was in the process of ceasing its film activities.
