{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1974, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. murdered his family at their house in Amityville, New York. He claimed that he was persuaded to kill them by voices he heard in the house. One year later, married couple George and Kathy Lutz move into the house along with Kathy's three children from a previous marriage, Billy, Michael, and Chelsea. The family soon begins experiencing paranormal events in the house. Chelsea claims that she befriended a girl named Jodie, a name belonging to one of the murdered DeFeo children. One day the couple decide to go out, and they hire a babysitter to watch the 3 kids. When the babysitter, Lisa, arrives they come to find out that she had previously been hired to babysit the DeFeos. | Lisa tells Billy about the murders that took place in their house. When she goes to Chelsea's room, Chelsea tells her that she is a bad babysitter, and claims that Jodie told her so. Lisa begins to scold Jodie for being the reason behind her getting fired. Then Billy dares Lisa to go inside the closet (the same closet where Jodie was murdered), and she gets locked inside. After a few seconds she encounters Jodie herself, and frantically begs to be let out. She goes into shock and the paramedics arrive to take her away; on the way to the hospital, Lisa tells Kathy that she had seen Jodie. Kathy asks priest Father Callaway (Philip Baker Hall) to bless the house, as a protective measure to prevent any future paranormal incidents, but Father Callaway flees the house when he encounters such occurrences himself. | George's behavior towards Kathy and her children becomes abusive and the paranormal activity continues; Kathy discovers that the house once belonged to a cult preacher named Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham, whose evil actions towards Native Americans in 17th century Amityville during his \"mission\" are said to be the cause of the haunting at 112 Ocean Avenue. She becomes convinced that George's abusive behavior is owed to a spiritual possession. Following the urgent advice from Father Callaway, Kathy tries to evacuate her children from the house and escort them to safety, but the possessed George attempts to kill her and the children; Kathy knocks him out to prevent him from doing so and transports him away from the residence. Subsequently, George is released from the spirit's control and the family permanently leaves the house. A title card states that the family left within 28 days of arriving and never returned for their personal items. Jodie is shown standing in the now empty house and screaming in terror while the house rearranges itself. Subsequently, she is pulled beneath the floor by a pair of disembodied hands.","m_cast":"Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz | Melissa George as Kathy Lutz | Jesse James as Billy Lutz | Jimmy Bennett as Michael Lutz | Chloë Grace Moretz as Chelsea Lutz | Rachel Nichols as Lisa | Philip Baker Hall as Father Callaway | Summer Courville as Jodie DeFeo | Brendan Donaldson as Ronald \"Ronnie\" DeFeo, Jr.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Although the film is set on Long Island, it was shot in Chicago, Antioch, Buffalo Grove, and Fox Lake in Illinois and Salem and Silver Lake in Wisconsin. | MGM claimed the remake was based on new information uncovered during research of the original events, but George Lutz later claimed nobody ever spoke to him or his family about the project. When he initially heard it was underway, his attorney contacted the studio to find out what they had in the planning stages and to express Lutz's belief they didn't have the right to proceed without his input. Three letters were sent and none was acknowledged. In June 2004, the studio filed a motion for declaratory relief in federal court, insisting they had the right to do a remake, and Lutz countersued, citing violations of the original contract that had continued through the years following the release of the first film.[3] The case remained unresolved when Lutz died in May 2006.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Amityville Horror  by Jay Anson","m_directed_by":"Andrew Douglas","m_produced_by":"Michael Bay | Andrew Form | Brad Fuller","m_screenplay_by":"Scott Kosar","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ryan Reynolds | Melissa George | Philip Baker Hall","m_music_by":"Steve Jablonsky","m_cinematography":"Peter Lyons Collister","m_edited_by":"Roger Barton | Christian Wagner","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer | Dimension Films","m_release_dates":"April 15, 2005 (2005-04-15) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"89 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$19 million[2]","m_box_office":"$108 million[2] | The Amityville Horror is a 2005 American supernatural horror film directed by Andrew Douglas and written by Scott Kosar.
