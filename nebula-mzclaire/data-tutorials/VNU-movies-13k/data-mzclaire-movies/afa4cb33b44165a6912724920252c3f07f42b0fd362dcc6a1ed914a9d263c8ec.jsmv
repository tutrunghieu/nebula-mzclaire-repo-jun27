{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After receiving a well-earned certification from a sheltered boarding school, Carla Tate (Juliette Lewis), an ambitious and mildly mentally challenged young woman, returns home to her over-protective and slightly snobby mother Elizabeth (Diane Keaton). Elizabeth seems to act as if she is embarrassed about her daughter's disability. During family discussions, Elizabeth adopts an uneasy attitude. Her father Radley (Tom Skerritt) is a dentist and recovering alcoholic. Carla's ambition is to seek more independence from her family by earning a diploma from a trade school. When Carla meets another mentally challenged student, Daniel McMann (Giovanni Ribisi), they become friends and soon fall in love. Envying Danny's freedom, Carla convinces her parents she is capable of living on her own and moves into her own apartment. After a time, Carla and Danny become sexually active together. | Danny's independence is financially compromised when his wealthy and emotionally detached father abruptly stops sending subsistence money. Danny begins to realize that the independence he enjoyed comes with a staggering cost. Danny gets drunk, then seeks solace and insight (and a joyride in a vintage Ford Mustang convertible) from his landlord and friend, Ernie (Hector Elizondo). | During a Christmas party at the country club, nervous about his personal lot, Daniel drinks too much to build up his courage to declare his love for Carla, also telling everyone about their first time making love. A humiliated Carla bursts into tears, screaming at everyone to stop laughing at her. Although Daniel did not intend to embarrass Carla, she nonetheless refuses to see him. Over time, Carla realizes she still loves Danny and wants to see him again despite her mother's advising her otherwise. At her sister Caroline's (Poppy Montgomery) wedding, Danny surprises Carla by showing up at the church and asking Carla to marry him, in a scene mimicking The Graduate, the couple's favorite film. | Everyone supports their wishes except Elizabeth, who is unsure Danny can take care of himself, let alone Carla, who becomes angry, telling her mother she is sick of her dominance and doubt and is also sick of her treating her like an embarrassment. Radley and her sisters Heather (Sarah Paulson) and Caroline support her decision, and the wedding is planned. At first, Elizabeth is determined not to attend; but Radley admonishes her, saying he will walk Carla down the aisle, and finally she relents. Outside the church, Danny surprises Carla with a marching band playing a song from The Music Man... and they are chauffeured away to their honeymoon in Ernie's prized Mustang.","m_cast":"Juliette Lewis as Carla Tate | Diane Keaton as Elizabeth Tate | Tom Skerritt as Dr. Radley Tate | Giovanni Ribisi as Daniel \"Danny\" McMann | Poppy Montgomery as Caroline Tate | Sarah Paulson as Heather Tate | Linda Thorson as Drew Evanson | Joe Flanigan as Jeff Reed | Juliet Mills as Winnie the Housekeeper | Tracy Reiner as Michelle | Hector Elizondo as Ernie","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Garry Marshall","m_produced_by":"Mario Iscovich | Alexandra Rose","m_screenplay_by":"Bob Brunner | Garry Marshall","m_story_by":"Bob Brunner | Garry Marshall | Alexandra Rose | Blair Richwood","m_starring":"Juliette Lewis | Diane Keaton | Tom Skerritt | Giovanni Ribisi","m_music_by":"Rachel Portman","m_cinematography":"Dante Spinotti","m_edited_by":"Bruce Green","m_production_company":"Touchstone Pictures Mandeville Films","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"February 26, 1999 (1999-02-26) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"130 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$35 million[2]","m_box_office":"$27.8 million[2] | The Other Sister is a 1999 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall and stars Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi, Diane Keaton, and Tom Skerritt.
