{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On her way back from whitewater rafting with her friends Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid), Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), along with her husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) and their daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) get involved in a car accident when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives. | One year later, Sarah and her friends Juno, Beth, Sam (MyAnna Buring), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), and newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. While spelunking, Juno apologises to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. As the group moves through a passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits she led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system like they originally planned, and that rescue is impossible because of this. She then tells Sarah that she led them into the unknown cave in the hopes of restoring their relationship, but Sarah rebuffs her. | As the group presses forward, they discover climbing equipment from a previous spelunker, and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists. Holly, thinking she sees sunlight, runs ahead, but falls down a hole and breaks her leg. As the others help Holly, Sarah wanders off and observes a pale, humanoid creature (called \"crawlers\" in the credits) drinking at a pool before it scampers away. Later, the group comes across a den of animal bones, and are suddenly attacked by a crawler. Holly is injured and dragged away by the crawler to her death, Sarah is knocked out by a fall, and Juno accidentally stabs Beth through the neck with a pickaxe after mistaking her for the crawler. | Sarah awakens to find herself in a den of human and animal carcasses, and witnesses Holly's body being consumed by a crawler. Juno discovers markings pointing to a specific path through the caves. After regrouping with Sam and Rebecca, and realizing the crawlers' hunting methods, Juno tells them the markings she discovered may point to the way out, but she will not leave without Sarah. Meanwhile, Sarah encounters Beth, who tells Sarah that Juno wounded her and abandoned her, and also reveals that Juno had an affair with Paul before his death. In pain, Beth tells Sarah to give her a mercy killing, Sarah reluctantly does so by bashing her head in with a rock. She then encounters a family of crawlers, but manages to kill them all, being covered in blood in the process. Afterwards, she has a psychotic breakdown. Elsewhere, Juno, Sam, and Rebecca are pursued by a large group of crawlers. Sam and Rebecca are killed, but Juno escapes. | Juno encounters Sarah and lies to her about seeing Beth die. After defeating a group of crawlers, Sarah confronts Juno, revealing that she knows that she wounded Beth and left her for dead, and also about the affair. She then strikes Juno in the leg with a pickaxe and leaves her to die to a group of approaching crawlers. Sarah falls down a hole and is knocked unconscious. She awakens, manages to escape the cave, runs to her vehicle, and speeds off. Upon seeing Juno sitting next to her, Sarah screams and reawakens to find herself still in the cavern, revealing that the events since her previous awakening were a dream. She hallucinates about a smiling Jessica close by her, just as the calls of the crawlers grow louder. | For the US theatrical release, the film ends with the appearance of Juno in the car, and the scene where Sarah hallucinates her daughter in the torchlight was removed entirely. The Unrated DVD released in the US includes the original ending. This ending leads to the events of the next film.[3]","m_cast":"Shauna Macdonald as Sarah Carter | Natalie Mendoza as Juno Kaplan | Alex Reid as Elizabeth \"Beth\" O'Brien | MyAnna Buring as Samantha \"Sam\" Vernet | Saskia Mulder as Rebecca Vernet | Nora-Jane Noone as Holly | Oliver Milburn as Paul Carter | Molly Kayll as Jessica Carter","m_reception":null,"m_production":"When Neil Marshall's 2002 film Dog Soldiers was a moderate success, the director received numerous requests to direct other horror films. The director was initially wary of being typecast as a horror film director, though he eventually agreed to make The Descent, emphasising, \"They are very different films.\"[4] Marshall decided to cast only women in the main roles, going against the original plan for a gender diverse cast. | Filmmakers originally planned for the cast to be both male and female, but Neil Marshall's business partner realised that horror films almost never have all-female casts. Defying convention, Marshall cast all women into the role, and to avoid making them clichéd, he solicited basic advice from his female friends. He explained the difference, \"The women discuss how they feel about the situation, which the soldiers in Dog Soldiers would never have done.\" He also gave the characters different accents to enable the audience to tell the difference between the women and to establish a more \"cosmopolitan feel\" than the British marketing of Dog Soldiers.[5] | The cast included Shauna Macdonald as Sarah, Natalie Mendoza as Juno, Alex Reid as Beth, Saskia Mulder as Rebecca, MyAnna Buring as Sam, Nora-Jane Noone as Holly, Oliver Milburn as Paul, and Molly Kayll as Jessica. Craig Conway portrayed one of the film's crawlers, Scar.[6] | While The Descent was set in North America, the film was shot entirely in the United Kingdom. Exterior scenes were filmed in Scotland, and interior scenes were filmed in sets built at Pinewood Studios near London. The cave was built at Pinewood because filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time-consuming to shoot in an actual cave. Set pieces were reused with care, and filmmakers sought to limit lighting to the sources that the characters bring with them into the cave, such as the helmet lights.[5] | Marshall cited the films The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Thing, and Deliverance as influences in establishing tension in The Descent. The director elaborated, \"We really wanted to ramp up the tension slowly, unlike all the American horror films you see now. They take it up to 11 in the first few minutes and then simply can't keep it up. We wanted to show all these terrible things in the cave: dark, drowning, claustrophobia. Then, when it couldn't get any worse, make it worse.\"[5] Marshall also said at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival that he was inspired by Italian horror films of the past, in particular by Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. | Simon Bowles designed the maze of caves for The Descent. Reviews credited Bowles: \"Bowles’ beautifully designed cave sets conjure a world of subterranean darkness.\"[7] There were 21 cave Sets, built by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo Ltd. using a unique system of polyurethane sprayed rock that was developed for this production. | Production of The Descent was in competition with a big budget American film of a similar premise, The Cave. The Descent was originally scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by November 2005 or February 2006, but The Cave began filming six months before its competitor. The Filmmakers of The Descent decided to release the film before The Cave, so they fast-tracked production to be completed by the end of February 2005.[5] | The Descent was released in North America with approximately a minute cut from the end. In the American cut, Sarah escapes from the cave and sees Juno, but the film does not cut back to the cave. | In the 4 August 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly, it was stated that the ending was trimmed because American viewers did not like its \"uber-hopeless finale\". Lionsgate marketing chief Tim Palen said, \"It's a visceral ride, and by the time you get to the ending you're drained. [Director Neil] Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film, so he was open [to making a switch].\" Marshall compared the change to the ending of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, saying, \"Just because she gets away, does that make it a happy ending?\" | The North American Unrated DVD includes the original ending. The film has aired on Canada's The Movie Network with the original ending aired the cut ending. In contrast, the American channels Syfy, IFC and Canada's Space broadcast the recut version of Sarah escaping, with Juno's spectre appearing beside her in the SUV. | As exhibited on Syfy (Latin America), The Descent retains the original ending, with Sarah awakening back in the cave facing her dead daughter surrounded by the crawlers.","m_sequel":"A sequel to The Descent was filmed at Ealing Studios in London during 2008 and was released on 2 December 2009 in the UK.","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Neil Marshall","m_produced_by":"Christian Colson","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Shauna Macdonald Natalie Mendoza Alex Reid Saskia Mulder MyAnna Buring Nora-Jane Noone","m_music_by":"David Julyan","m_cinematography":"Sam McCurdy","m_edited_by":"Jon Harris","m_production_company":"Celador Films Northmen Productions","m_distributed_by":"Pathé (Europe) Lionsgate (North America)","m_release_dates":"6 July 2005 (2005-07-06) (Dead by Dawn) | 8 July 2006 (2006-07-08) (UK, Ireland) | 4 August 2006 (2006-08-04) (US) |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£3.5 million[1]","m_box_office":"$57.1 million[2] | The Descent is a 2005 British horror film written and directed by Neil Marshall. The film follows six women who, having entered an unmapped cave system, become trapped and are hunted by troglofaunal flesh-eating humanoids. | Filming took place in the United Kingdom. Exterior scenes were filmed at Ashridge Park, Buckinghamshire/Hertfordshire. Because the filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time-consuming to shoot in an actual cave, interior scenes were filmed on sets built at Pinewood Studios near London. The Descent opened commercially 8 July 2005 in the United Kingdom. It premiered in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and opened commercially on 4 August 2006 in the United States. | A sequel, titled The Descent Part 2, was released in 2009 and depicts events that take place two days after the end of the original film. It was successful, earning twice as much as the film's budget; however, not as much as the original and was not as favorably reviewed. |  | ","m_marketing":"The skull of women motif used in some advertising material is based on Philippe Halsman's In Voluptas Mors photograph.[18] | The film's marketing campaign in the United Kingdom was disrupted by the London bombings in July 2005. Advertisements on London's public transport system (including the bus that had exploded) had included posters that carried the quote, \"Outright terror... bold and brilliant\", and depicted a terrified woman screaming in a tunnel. The film's theatrical distributor in the UK, Pathé, recalled the posters from their placement in the London Underground and reworked the campaign to exclude the word \"terror\" from advertised reviews of The Descent. Pathé also distributed the new versions to TV and radio stations. The distributor's marketing chief, Anna Butler, said of the new approach, \"We changed tack to concentrate on the women involved all standing together and fighting back. That seemed to chime with the prevailing mood of defiance that set in the weekend after the bombs.\"[19] | Neil Marshall stated in a review \"Shauna was pretty upset about it; it was on newspapers all across the county\" and cites the attacks as harming the film's box office, as \"people were still trapped underground in reality, so no one really wanted to go see a film about people trapped underground...\".[20] | Many commentators, including writers for Variety and The Times, remarked on the rather unfortunate coincidence. | Due to these events there was some initial concern that the film's release might have been delayed out of sensitivity for the tragedy but Pathé ultimately chose to release the film on schedule, with a slightly retooled advertising campaign; however, the US promotional campaign managed by Lionsgate Films was significantly different from the original European version.","m_reference":"^ \"The Descent\".
