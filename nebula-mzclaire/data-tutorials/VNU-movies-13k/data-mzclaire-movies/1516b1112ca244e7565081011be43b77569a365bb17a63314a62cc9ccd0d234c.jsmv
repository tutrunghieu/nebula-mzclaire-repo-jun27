{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story takes place in an alternate world dominated by a powerful church called the Magisterium, and where part of the soul resides outside a person as an animal companion called a dæmon. Lyra Belacqua, an orphan raised in a college in Oxford, England, and her dæmon Pantalaimon (Pan) witness a Magisterium agent poison her uncle's bottle of Tokay. Lyra then warns her uncle, Lord Asriel, who instructs her to remain in hiding. Lyra watches Asriel give a presentation regarding Dust, a particle that the Magisterium has forbidden the mention of. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund a northern expedition. | At dinner, Lyra meets Mrs. Coulter, who insists on taking Lyra north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the Master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer, a compass-like artifact that reveals the truth. The Magisterium has destroyed all the others. He instructs her to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Coulter. | At Mrs. Coulter's house in a city that resembles a futuristic London, Lyra mentions 'dust', a type of mysterious particle. This puts Mrs. Coulter on edge and she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she leave the bag containing the aleithiometer. Mrs. Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pan, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pan discover that Mrs. Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, the \"Gobblers\", who have been kidnapping local children. She also discovers that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been taken by the Gobblers. | Lyra and Pan walk in on Mrs. Coulter's dæmon attempting to steal the alethiometer. They escape into the streets. The \"Gobblers\" pursue her, but she is saved by some Gyptians. Aboard a Gyptian boat heading north to rescue their children, Lyra shows the alethiometer to a Gyptian wise man, Farder Coram. On deck that night Serafina Pekkala, the witch queen, tells Lyra that the missing children are in a place called Bolvangar. Mrs. Coulter sends two mechanical spy flies after Lyra. Pan; one is batted away but the other is caught and sealed in a tin can by Farder Coram, who explains that the spy fly has a sting with a sleeping poison. Lord Asriel is captured by Samoyeds hired by Mrs. Coulter on his expedition but he bribes his captors into releasing him. | At a northern port, Lyra is befriended by a Texan aeronaut named Lee Scoresby, who advises her to hire an armoured bear. Exiled in shame, the giant polar bear Iorek Byrnison has been tricked out of his armour by the local townspeople. Using the alethiometer Lyra tells Iorek where to find his armour. Armoured again, the fearsome Iorek and his friend Lee Scoresby join the trek northward. | That night while riding on Iorek's back, Lyra finds a cowering and changed Billy separated from his dæmon Ratter. Lyra reunites Billy with his mother just as the group is attacked by Samoyeds who capture Lyra. Taken to the armoured bear king Ragnar Sturlusson, Lyra tricks him into fighting Iorek one on one. At first, Ragnar seems to have the upper hand in the fight, but Iorek eventually tricks his rival and kills him. He then becomes the new king. Iorek carries Lyra near to a thin ice bridge near Bolvangar. Reaching the station, Lyra is taken to eat with the missing children. While hiding again Lyra discovers that the Magisterium scientists, under the guidance of Mrs. Coulter, are performing experiments to sever the bond between a child and his or her dæmon. Caught spying, Lyra and Pan are thrown in the intercision chamber, and end up unconscious from the energy force that tries to cut them. On seeing Lyra in the guillotine, Mrs. Coulter rescues her and takes her to her quarters. | When Lyra wakes up she is comforted by a distraught Mrs. Coulter, who explains the dæmon cutting to Lyra and also tells Lyra that she is her mother. Lyra then guesses that Lord Asriel is her father. When Mrs. Coulter asks for the alethiometer, Lyra gives her the can containing the spy fly. The spy fly stings Mrs. Coulter, knocking her and her dæmon out. Lyra runs to the room with the intercision machine. The growing chain reaction builds as Lyra yanks a control box loose and hurls it into the intercision machine, causing it to explode. This sets off a series of explosions that tear the facility apart. | Outside, the children are attacked by Tartar mercenaries and their wolf dæmons. The battle is joined by Iorek, the Gyptians, and a band of flying witches led by Serafina Pekkala. The Tartars are defeated and the children are rescued. Rather than returning south, Lyra, Roger and Iorek fly north with Lee Scoresby in search of Lord Asriel. | Unaware that he is in mortal danger, Lord Asriel has set up a laboratory to investigate the glowing Dust from another world.","m_cast":"Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra Belacqua, who embarks on a voyage to battle the forces of evil and rescue her best friend. New Line Cinema announced 12-year-old Richards' casting in June 2006.[5] It was her first acting role.[6] | Freddie Highmore as the voice of Pantalaimon, Lyra's dæmon. Pan was originally to be voiced by an older actor, but they called in Highmore instead, as it would be more of an intimate relationship if Pan and Lyra were the same age, and also would underscore the contrast between Lyra's relationship with him versus her relationships with older male characters such as Lord Asriel, Lee Scoresby, and Iorek. | Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, an influential woman who takes an interest in Lyra (and later admits that she is Lyra's mother). Kidman was author Philip Pullman's preferred choice for the role ten years before production of the film,[7] and despite initially rejecting the offer to star as she did not want to play a villain, she signed on after receiving a personal letter from Pullman.[8] | Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Lyra's strict and mysterious adventurer uncle (later revealed to be her father). In July 2006, it was reported that Paul Bettany was in talks to play the role.[9] | Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, a Texan aeronaut who comes to Lyra's aid. Pullman has singled out Elliott's performance as one the film got \"just right\".[10] | Ian McKellen as the voice of Iorek Byrnison, a panserbjørn (armored bear) who becomes Lyra's friend and comrade. Nonso Anozie had recorded lines for the part of Iorek Byrnison, but was replaced by McKellen at a late stage as New Line wanted a bigger name in the role.[11] New Line president of production Toby Emmerich claimed that he \"never thought Anozie sounded like Iorek\" and while he initially trusted director Weitz's casting decision, he \"never stopped thinking that this guy didn't sound right.\" The recasting was against Weitz's wishes, though he later said \"if you're going to have anyone recast in your movie, you're happy it's Ian McKellen.\"[5] | Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, a witch queen. In an interview, Green has described her character and her looks: \"I wanted to look a bit like from the Waterhouse painting. You know, quite pre-Raphaelite. And also she's barefoot, quite ethereal, and the material's quite translucent and see-through, because witches don't feel the cold. If they were going to wear heavy clothing it would prevent them from sensing the world around them. They're very close to nature.\"[12] | Ian McShane as the voice of Ragnar Sturlusson, king of the panserbjørner. Ragnar's name in the book was Iofur Raknison, but the name was changed to prevent confusion between him and Iorek.[13] However, in the German-language version of the film, the dialogue retains the name \"Iofur Raknison\", whilst the subtitles reflect the change. | Kathy Bates as the voice of Hester, Lee Scoresby's jackrabbit dæmon. | Kristin Scott Thomas as the voice of Stelmaria, Lord Asriel's dæmon. | Ben Walker as Roger Parslow, Lyra's best friend, who is kidnapped and taken north. | Jim Carter as John Faa, the king of the Gyptians. | Tom Courtenay as Farder Coram, Gyptian second-in-command and advisor to John Faa. | Christopher Lee as the Magisterium's first high councilor. Lee's casting was also at New Line's behest, rather than that of Chris Weitz.[5] | Edward de Souza as the Magisterium's second high councilor. | Simon McBurney as Fra Pavel | Jack Shepherd as master of Jordan College. | Magda Szubanski as Mrs. Lonsdale | Derek Jacobi as the Magisterial emissary. | Clare Higgins as Ma Costa, member of a Gyptian family that aids Lyra. | Charlie Rowe as Billy Costa, son of Ma Costa, and Lyra's friend.","m_reception":"The North American opening weekend return was \"a little disappointing\" for New Line Cinema,[57] earning US$25.8 million with total domestic box office of $70 million compared to an estimated $180 million production budget.[1] Despite this, the film's loss rebounded as its performance outside the United States was described as \"stellar\" by Variety,[58] and as \"astonishing\" by New Line.[59] In the United Kingdom, the film grossed $53,198,635 and became the second highest grossing non-sequel of 2007 there (behind The Simpsons Movie). In Japan, the film was officially released in March 2008 on 700 screens, ultimately grossing $33,501,399; but previews of the film between February 23–24, 2008, earned $2.5 million. By July 6, 2008, it had earned $302,127,136 internationally, totaling $372,234,864 worldwide.[1] Overseas rights to the film were sold to fund the $180 million production budget for the film, so most of these profits did not go to New Line.[60] This has been cited as a potential \"last straw\" in Time Warner's decision to merge New Line Cinema into Warner Bros Pictures.[3] | Reviews of The Golden Compass were mixed.[61] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 43% rating, based on 192 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"Without the bite or the controversy of the source material, The Golden Compass is reduced to impressive visuals overcompensating for lax storytelling.\"[62] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 51, based on 33 reviews.[63] | Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that the film \"crams so many events, characters, [...] twists and turns, sumptuously appointed rooms and ethereally strange vistas [...] that [it] risks losing you in the whirl\" and that while The Golden Compass is \"an honorable work,\" it is \"hampered by its fealty to the book and its madly rushed pace.\"[64] James Berardinelli of ReelReviews gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, calling it \"adequate, but not inspired\" and criticising the first hour for its rushed pace and sketchily-developed characters.[65] James Christopher of The Times was disappointed, praising the \"marvellous\" special effects and casting, but saying that the \"books weave a magic the film simply cannot match\" and citing a \"lack of genuine drama.\"[66] | Time rated it a \"B\" and called it a \"good, if familiar fantasy,\" saying \"The find is Dakota Blue Richards [...] who's both grounded and magical.\"[67] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated it four stars out of five, praising Nicole Kidman's casting and saying it had \"no other challengers as [2007's] big Christmas movie.\"[68] Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of four stars, and said that \"Richards is persuasive\" and that it \" does a good job of introducing us to an unfamiliar world.\" Critic Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars and called it \"a darker, deeper fantasy epic than the The Chronicles of Narnia or the Potter films,\" saying that it \"creates villains that are more complex and poses more intriguing questions. As a visual experience, it is superb. As an escapist fantasy, it is challenging [...] I think [it] is a wonderfully good-looking movie, with exciting passages and a captivating heroine.\"[69] | Pullman himself was described by a Times interviewer as sounding \"ambivalent\" and \"guarded\" about the film, saying in March 2008: \"A lot of things about it were good... Nothing's perfect. Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises\". He hoped, however, that the rest of the trilogy would be adapted with the same cast and crew.[70] In July 2009, after this possibility had been exhausted, Weitz told Time.com that he thought the film's special effects ended up being its \"most successful element.\"[30] | At the British Humanist Association conference in 2011, Pullman disclosed that there were not going to be any more films with the same cast and crew. On reflection, while praising the portrayals of his characters by Nicole Kidman and Dakota Blue Richards, Pullman said that he was disappointed with the end film and New Line's re-editing of it. | Pullman expressed his distaste for the film again in 2014, calling it \"over-designed\" and criticizing the screenplay: \"They needed an ending that would work for a single film, but one that would also work if it was the first of a trilogy. They wanted both a cliffhanger and a resolution. You just can’t do that.\"[71] | The Golden Compass won the 2008 BAFTA Award for Special Visual Effects[72] and an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects notably beating what many considered to be the front runner, Michael Bay's Transformers which had swept the Visual Effects Society awards prior.[73] It was also nominated for two Critics' Choice Awards in 2007 (\"Best Family Film,\" and \"Best Young Actress\" for Dakota Blue Richards[74]), five Satellite Awards, and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form. The Golden Compass was nominated for the National Movie Award for Best Family movie but lost to Disney/Pixar's WALL-E.","m_production":"On February 11, 2002, following the success of New Line's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the studio bought the rights to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. In July 2003 Tom Stoppard was commissioned to write the screenplay.[6] Directors Brett Ratner and Sam Mendes expressed interest in the film,[6] but a year later, Chris Weitz was hired to direct after approaching the studio with an unsolicited 40-page treatment.[14] The studio rejected the script, asking Weitz to start from scratch. Since Weitz was a fan of Stoppard, he decided not to read the adaptation in case he \"subconsciously poached things from him.\"[15] After delivering his script, Weitz cited Barry Lyndon and Star Wars as stylistic influences on the film.[6] In 2004, Weitz was invited by The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson onto the set of King Kong in order to gather information on directing a blockbuster film, and to receive advice on dealing with New Line Cinema, for whom Jackson had worked on Lord of the Rings. After a subsequent interview in which Weitz said the novel's attacks on organised religion would have to be softened, he was criticised by some fans,[5] and on December 15, 2004, Weitz announced his resignation as director of the trilogy, citing the enormous technical challenges of the epic.[6] He later indicated that he had envisioned the possibility of being denounced by both the book's fans and its detractors, as well as a studio hoping for another Lord of the Rings.[5] | On August 9, 2005, it was announced that British director Anand Tucker would take over from Weitz. Tucker felt the film would thematically be about Lyra \"looking for a family\",[6] and Pullman agreed: \"He has plenty of very good ideas, and he isn't daunted by the technical challenges. But the best thing from the point of view of all who care about the story is his awareness that it isn't about computer graphics; it isn't about fantastic adventures in amazing-looking worlds; it's about Lyra.\"[16] Tucker resigned on May 8, 2006, citing creative disagreements with New Line, and Weitz returned to direct.[6] Weitz said \"I'm both the first and third director on the film ..but I did a lot of growing in the interim.\"[17] | According to producer Deborah Forte, Tucker wanted to make a smaller, less exciting film than New Line wanted. New Line production president Toby Emmerich said of Weitz's return: \"I think Chris realized that if he didn’t come back in and step up, maybe the movie wasn’t going to get made ... We really didn’t have a Plan B at that point.\"[14] Weitz was attracted back to the project after receiving a letter from Pullman asking him to reconsider. Since his departure, blueprints, production design and visual effects strategies had been put into position, and while Weitz admitted that his fears did not vanish, the project suddenly seemed feasible for the director.[5] | Filming began at Shepperton Studios on September 4, 2006,[6] with additional sequences shot in Switzerland and Norway.[14] Filming also took place at the Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich,[18] Chiswick House in London, and in Radcliffe Square, Christ Church, Oxford, Exeter College, Oxford, The Queen's College, Oxford, The Historic Dockyard Chatham[19] and Hedsor House in Buckinghamshire. | Production Designer Dennis Gassner says of his work on the film: “The whole project is about translation – translation from something you would understand into something that is in a different vernacular. So, it’s a new signature, looking into another world that seems familiar but is still unique. There’s a term I use – called 'cludging' – it’s taking one element and combining it with another element to make something new. It’s a hybrid or amalgamation, and that’s what this movie is about from a design perspective. It’s about amalgamating ideas and concepts and theoretical and physical environments.”[20] | Rhythm and Hues Studios created the main dæmons, and Framestore CFC created all the bears.[21] British company Cinesite created the secondary dæmons.[22] | Alexandre Desplat composed the soundtrack to the film. Music icon Kate Bush recorded the track \"Lyra\" which plays over the end credits.[23]","m_sequel":"At the time of The Golden Compass' theatrical release, Chris Weitz pledged to \"protect [the] integrity\" of the prospective sequels by being \"much less compromising\" in the book-to-film adaptation process.[26] New Line Cinema commissioned Hossein Amini to write a screenplay based on the second book in the trilogy, The Subtle Knife, potentially for release in 2010 or 2011, with the third book of the trilogy, The Amber Spyglass, to follow. However, New Line president Toby Emmerich stressed that production of the second and third films was dependent on the financial success of The Golden Compass.[79] When The Golden Compass did not meet expectations at the United States box office, the likelihood of a sequel was downplayed by New Line. According to studio co-head Michael Lynne, \"The jury is still very much out on the movie, and while it's performed very strongly overseas we'll look at it early 2008 and see where we're going with a sequel.\"[80] | In February 2008, Weitz told The Daily Yomiuri, a Japanese newspaper, that he still hoped for the sequels' production: \"at first it looked like we were down for the count because in the U.S. [the film] underperformed, but then internationally it performed [better] than expectations. So, a lot depends on Japan, frankly... I think if it does well enough here we'll be in good shape for that.\"[81] Although producer Deborah Forte had, in March 2008, expressed optimism that the sequels would be made,[82] by October 2008, the two planned sequels were officially placed on hold, according to New Line Cinema, because of financial concerns during the global recession.[83] [84]Sam Elliott, however, stated, \"The Catholic Church ... lambasted them, and I think it scared New Line off.\"[85] | In 2011, Philip Pullman remarked at the British Humanist Association annual conference that there were not going to be any more films from the series made with the same cast.[citation needed]","m_based_on":"Northern Lights  by Philip Pullman","m_directed_by":"Chris Weitz","m_produced_by":"Bill Carraro Deborah Forte","m_screenplay_by":"Chris Weitz","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Nicole Kidman | Sam Elliott | Eva Green | Dakota Blue Richards | Ian McShane | Ian McKellen | Freddie Highmore | Kathy Bates | Kristin Scott Thomas | Daniel Craig","m_music_by":"Alexandre Desplat","m_cinematography":"Henry Braham","m_edited_by":"Anne V.

Written and directed by Chris Weitz, it stars Dakota Blue Richards, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Tom Courtenay, Christopher Lee, Nicole Kidman and Sam Elliott. The project was announced in February 2002, following the success of recent adaptations of other fantasy epics, but troubles over the script and the selection of a director caused significant delays. At US$180 million, it was one of New Line Cinema's most expensive projects ever,[2] and its middling success in the USA contributed to New Line's February 2008 restructuring.[3] | The story depicts the adventures of Lyra Belacqua, an orphan living in a parallel universe on a world that looks much like our own. In Lyra's world, a dogmatic ruling power called the Magisterium is conspiring to end tolerance and free inquiry. Poor, orphan, and Gyptian children are disappearing at the hands of a group the children call the Gobblers. When Lyra discovers that Mrs. Coulter is running the Gobblers, she flees. Rescued by the Gyptians, Lyra joins them on a trip to the far north, to the land of the armored polar bears, in search of the missing children. | Before its release, the film received criticism from secularist organisations and fans of His Dark Materials for the dilution of the anti-religious elements from the novels, as well as from some religious organisations for the source material's anti-Catholic themes. The studio ordered significant changes late in post-production, which Weitz later called a \"terrible\" experience.[4] Although the film's visual effects (which Weitz has called the film's \"most successful element\") won both a BAFTA and an Academy Award, critical reception was mixed. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e \"The Golden Compass (2007)\".
