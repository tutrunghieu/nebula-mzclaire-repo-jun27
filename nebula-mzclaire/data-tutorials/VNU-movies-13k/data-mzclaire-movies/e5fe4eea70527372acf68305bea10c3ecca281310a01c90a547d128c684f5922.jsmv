{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a former pool hustler turned successful liquor salesman. One night he meets Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise), a young, charismatic pool player and video gamer who plays small-time nine-ball games while working as a sales clerk at a toy store. Eddie, who still stakes bets for talented players like Julian (John Turturro), persuades Vincent and girlfriend/manager Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) to go on the road, where he can teach Vincent how to make much more money through hustling pool. | With Eddie staking their bets, Vincent visits a series of billiard halls where Eddie tries to teach him that \"pool excellence is not about excellent pool.\" Although Carmen is a quick study, Vincent chafes at Eddie's scams, which routinely require him to play well below his abilities. Eventually, Fast Eddie picks up a cue himself, and does well in several games, but is taken in by a pool shark named Amos (Forest Whitaker). Humiliated, Eddie leaves Vincent and Carmen with enough money to make it to the championships in Atlantic City. | Wearing new prescription eyeglasses, Eddie begins working out and practicing. He enters the 9-ball tournament in Atlantic City and, after several victories, finds himself facing off against a more world-wise Vincent. He beats Vincent, but later, when he is celebrating with girlfriend Janelle (Helen Shaver), Vincent arrives and informs Eddie that he intentionally lost in order to collect on a bet. He gives Eddie $8,000 as his \"cut.\" During his semi-final match against Kennedy, Eddie sees his reflection on the cue ball, disgruntled he chooses to forfeit the game. | Out-hustled again, Eddie returns the money, saying that he wants to beat Vincent legitimately. The two set up a private match, where Eddie informs Vincent that if he doesn't beat him now, he will in the future because \"I'm back!\"","m_cast":"Paul Newman – Fast Eddie Felson | Tom Cruise – Vincent Lauria | Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio – Carmen | Helen Shaver – Janelle | John Turturro – Julian | Bill Cobbs – Orvis | Forest Whitaker – Amos | Many top American pool players of the 1980s had speaking roles, including Steve Mizerak, Grady Mathews, and Keith McCready, and there were many cameo appearances, including Jimmy Mataya, Mark Jarvis, Howard Vickery and Louie Roberts. | Director Scorsese has a cameo walking his dog, and another playing pool. Another notable cameo is that of Iggy Pop, who plays one of the many contenders on the road. Screenwriter Richard Price also has a cameo as a bar fly in the pool hall where Eddie plays Amos.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Scorsese has cited the influence of techniques and lighting in the 1947 Powell-Pressburger classic Black Narcissus in making the film. In particular he states that the extreme close ups of Tom Cruise around the pool table were inspired by those of the nuns in that film.[3] Newman said that the best advice he was given by Scorsese was to \"try not to be funny\". Cruise performed most of his own shots. An exception was a jump shot over two balls to sink another. Scorsese believed Cruise could learn the shot, but that it would take too long, so the shot was performed for him by Mike Sigel. Cruise mentioned, to prepare for the role, he bought a pool table for his apartment and practiced for hours on end. Standing in for the extremely valuable \"Balabushka\" cue in the movie was actually a Joss J-18 (which later became the Joss 10-N7), made to resemble a classic Balabushka.[4] | Mike Sigel was technical director, and he and Ewa Mataya Laurance served as technical consultants and shot-performers on the film. | Absent from the film is the character Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason in The Hustler. Newman later said that he had wanted the character to appear, but that none of the attempts to include him fit well into the story that was being written. According to Scorsese, Gleason apparently agreed with Newman's opinion that Minnesota Fats was not essential to the film's story. Scorsese said that Gleason was presented a draft of the script that had Fats worked into the narrative, but that upon reading it, Gleason declined to reprise the role because he felt that the character seemed to have been added as \"an afterthought\".[2][5] | Reflecting the general theme of the film, director Martin Scorsese delivers an opening uncredited voiceover, describing the game of nine-ball, over a scene of cigarette smoke and a piece of cue chalk: | Nine-Ball is rotation pool, the balls are pocketed in numbered order. The only ball that means anything, that wins it, is the 9. Now, the player can shoot eight trick shots in a row, blow the 9, and lose. On the other hand, the player can get the 9 in on the break, if the balls spread right, and win. Which is to say, that luck plays a part in nine-ball. But for some players, luck itself is an art.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Color of Money  by Walter Tevis","m_directed_by":"Martin Scorsese","m_produced_by":"Irving Axelrad Barbara De Fina","m_screenplay_by":"Richard Price","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Paul Newman | Tom Cruise | Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio","m_music_by":"Robbie Robertson","m_cinematography":"Michael Ballhaus","m_edited_by":"Thelma Schoonmaker","m_production_company":"Touchstone Pictures Silver Screen Partners II","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Distribution","m_release_dates":"October 17, 1986 (1986-10-17) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"120 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$13.8 million","m_box_office":"$52.2 million | The Color of Money is a 1986 American drama film directed by Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Richard Price, based on the 1984 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis. The film stars Paul Newman and Tom Cruise, with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Helen Shaver, and John Turturro. The film featured an original score by Robbie Robertson. | Newman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. | The film continues the story of pool hustler and stakehorse Edward \"Fast Eddie\" Felson from Tevis' first novel, The Hustler (1959), with Newman reprising his role from its film adaptation (1961). Unlike The Hustler, which was released by 20th Century Fox, The Color of Money was released by Disney's Touchstone Pictures label. The film begins at a point more than 20 years after the events of the previous film, with Eddie retired from the pool circuit. Although Tevis did author a screenplay for the film, having adapted the storyline directly from his novel, the filmmakers decided not to use it, instead crafting an entirely different story under Tevis' title.[1][2] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ LoBrutto, Vincent (November 30, 2007).
