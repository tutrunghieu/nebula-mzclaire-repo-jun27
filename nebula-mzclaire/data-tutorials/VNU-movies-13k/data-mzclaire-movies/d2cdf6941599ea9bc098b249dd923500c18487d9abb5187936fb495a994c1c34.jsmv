{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bud Davis (John Travolta) moves to Houston for a job in the city's oil refinery industry. He hopes to save enough money to move back to his hometown of Spur, Texas and buy some land.[4] Bud stays with his Uncle Bob (Barry Corbin) and his family, with whom Bud is close. Bob takes Bud to the local honky tonk, Gilley's (at the time, an actual bar in Pasadena, co-owned by singer Mickey Gilley and his record producer Sherwood Cryer). Bud quickly embraces the local nightlife there. | At the club, Bud meets Sissy (Debra Winger), who asks if he is a real cowboy. They fall in love, and soon after Bud asks Sissy to marry him. Their wedding reception is held at Gilley's, and they immediately move into a brand new mobile home. Although they are in love and passionate, Bud and Sissy have many quarrels. Sissy is a feisty, independent woman while Bud believes in traditional gender roles. However, their lives settle into a routine of work by day and Gilley's at night, where Bud takes a liking to riding the mechanical bull. When Sissy also wants to ride, he forbids her. | Wes Hightower (Scott Glenn), on parole from Huntsville Penitentiary, lands a job at Gilley's running the mechanical bull due to his rodeo skills. He flirts with Sissy, who is flattered, but a drunken Bud is enraged, and he and Wes end up in a fist fight. Sissy, against Bud's wishes, spends time at Gilley's during the day learning how to ride the mechanical bull. One night, Jessie, Sissy's friend, and Wes convince Sissy to ride the bull. She does it to impress Bud, but he becomes angry and resentful that Sissy defied him, and challenges her. When Bud falls off during his second ride in that challenge, Wes swings the bull around fast, breaking Bud's arm. At home, Sissy accuses Bud of being jealous because she rides the bull better than he can. Bud slaps her and throws her out of the trailer. | Shortly after, Sissy and Bud see each other at Gilley's, but Sissy, still angry, refuses to talk to Bud. To make Sissy jealous, Bud introduces himself to a beautiful girl named Pam (Madolyn Smith) and dances with her, while Sissy dances with Wes. Bud and Pam leave together but Sissy, upset, declines Wes' sexual advances. Soon after, however, Sissy moves in with Wes, who lives in a run-down trailer behind Gilley's. | Bud wants to enter the mechanical bull riding contest at Gilley's and starts training with his uncle Bob, a former rodeo champion. Bob advises Bud to swallow his pride and make up with Sissy. Meanwhile, Sissy returns to their mobile home to pick up her things, but she also cleans house and leaves Bud a note saying she hopes they can get back together. Pam arrives, and after Sissy leaves, Pam throws the note away. Meanwhile, Sissy catches Wes with Marshalene, who works at Gilley's. Wes is abusive when Sissy reacts angrily. | Uncle Bob is killed in an explosion at the refinery. At his funeral, Sissy tells Bud that Wes was fired from Gilley's and is unable to find another job. They are going to Mexico after Wes wins the $5000 prize at the bull riding contest. It is Bud who wins the contest, however, and Pam, realizing that he still loves Sissy, encourages him to reconcile with her. | Sissy refuses to go to Mexico with Wes, but relents after he hits her. He orders her to wait for him in her car behind Gilley's. Unknown to Sissy, Wes is inside stealing the prize money. Bud finds Sissy in the parking lot and tells her he still loves her. She reciprocates and they embrace. Seeing Sissy's bruised face, Bud goes after Wes and a fight ensues at the bar entrance. The fight causes Wes to drop his gun, and the stolen money falls from his jacket. Bud overpowers Wes and after punching him several times, pins him down on the floor. Gilley's staff, having discovered the robbery, apprehend Wes. Bud and Sissy, reconciled, go home together.","m_cast":"John Travolta as Bud Davis | Debra Winger as Sissy Davis | Scott Glenn as Wes Hightower | Madolyn Smith as Pam | Barry Corbin as Bob Davis | Brooke Alderson as Corene Davis | Cooper Huckabee as Marshall | James Gammon as Steve Strange | Steve Strange as Sam Strange | Mickey Gilley as Himself | Johnny Lee as Himself | Bonnie Raitt as Herself | Charlie Daniels as Himself | Ellen March as Becky | Jessie La Rive as Jessie | Howard Henson as Himself | Connie Hanson as Marshalene","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Bridges","m_produced_by":"Irving Azoff Robert Evans","m_screenplay_by":"James Bridges Aaron Latham","m_story_by":"Aaron Latham","m_starring":"John Travolta Debra Winger Scott Glenn Barry Corbin Madolyn Smith","m_music_by":"Ralph Burns","m_cinematography":"Reynaldo Villalobos","m_edited_by":"David Rawlins","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"June 6, 1980 (1980-06-06) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"132 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$53,300,000 (USA) | Urban Cowboy is a 1980 American western romantic drama film about the love-hate relationship between Buford Uan \"Bud\" Davis (John Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger).
