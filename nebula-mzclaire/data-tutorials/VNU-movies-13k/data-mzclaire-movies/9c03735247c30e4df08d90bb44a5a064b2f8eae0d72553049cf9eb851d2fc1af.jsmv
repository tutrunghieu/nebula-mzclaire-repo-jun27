{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A detective named Fisher, who has become an expatriate living in Cairo, undergoes hypnosis in order to recall his last case. The postwar Germany of his dreamlike recollection is a dystopia, dark and decaying. Fisher remembers pursuing an elusive killer called the \"Lotto Murderer\", who was strangling and then mutilating young girls who were selling lottery tickets. He attempts to track down the killer using the controversial methods outlined in a book entitled The Element of Crime, written by his disgraced mentor, Osborne. He is joined in his search by a prostitute named Kim, who, it turns out, has had a child by his target. Fisher's search is based on a tailing report written by Osborne when trying to track down a murderer who had been killing in the same way as the \"Lotto Murderer\", but who, supposedly, has since died in a crash. The Osborne method requires the detective to try to identify with the mind of the killer. This he does, but, in so doing, begins to behave more and more like a serial killer himself.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Element of Crime received positive reviews, currently holding a 77% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[6] | The film received several awards including the Danish Bodil and Robert awards in 1985 for the best film, and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lars von Trier","m_produced_by":"Per Holst[1]","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Elphick Esmond Knight Meme Lai Jerold Wells","m_music_by":"Bo Holten","m_cinematography":"Tom Elling","m_edited_by":"Tómas Gislason","m_production_company":"Det Danske Filminstitut","m_distributed_by":"Kærne Film","m_release_dates":"14 May 1984 (1984-05-14) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"103 minutes[2]","m_country":"Denmark","m_language":"English Arabic | The Element of Crime is a 1984 Danish neo-noir crime art film co-written and directed by Lars von Trier.
