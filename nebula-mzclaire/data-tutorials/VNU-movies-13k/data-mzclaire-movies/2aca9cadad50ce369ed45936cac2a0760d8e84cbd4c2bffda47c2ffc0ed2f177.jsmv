{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A woman named Karen (Susan Strasberg), who is suffering from a growing tumor on her neck, enters a hospital in San Francisco. After a series of X-rays, the doctors begin to think it is a living creature: a fetus being born inside the tumor. Eerie and grisly occurrences begin; the tumorous growth perceives itself – himself – to be under attack as a result of the X-rays used to ascertain its nature, which are starting to stunt and deform its development. The growth is the old Native American shaman, Misquamacus; he is reincarnating himself through the young woman to exact his revenge on white men who invaded North America and exterminated its native peoples. Karen's boyfriend, psychic fortune-teller Harry Erskine (Tony Curtis) contacts a second Native American shaman (Michael Ansara) to help fight the reincarnating medicine man, but the kind of spirits he can summon and control appear to be too weak to match his opponent's abilities.","m_cast":"Tony Curtis as Harry Erskine | Michael Ansara as John Singing Rock | Susan Strasberg as Karen Tandy | Stella Stevens as Amelia Crusoe | Jon Cedar as Dr. Jack Hughes | Ann Sothern as Mrs. Karmann | Burgess Meredith as Dr. Snow | Paul Mantee as Dr. McEvoy | Jeanette Nolan as Mrs. Winconis | Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Herz | Hugh Corcoran as MacArthur","m_reception":"Critical reception for The Manitou has been mixed to negative.
