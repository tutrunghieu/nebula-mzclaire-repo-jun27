{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bob Saginowski is a bartender at a neighborhood bar in Brooklyn. Marvin Stipler ceded ownership of the bar years earlier to Chechen mobsters and now operates it with Bob as a 'drop' for illegal takings. Marv berates Bob and some patrons for commemorating the 10th anniversary of the murder of a man named Richie Whelan. | Nadia, Bob’s neighbour, finds him rescuing a battered pit bull pup abandoned in her garbage can. Bob leaves the dog in her care until he can decide whether to adopt him. | When the bar is robbed by two masked gunmen, Marv is infuriated that Bob told investigating Detective Torres that one of the gunmen was wearing a broken watch. Chechen thug Chovka later tells Marv and Bob that they must make up for the stolen money. Marv meets with one of the perpetrators, revealing that he orchestrated the robbery. A later discussion between Marv and his sister, Dottie, reveals Marv’s motive is to continue payments for his father’s life support medical bills. | Bob decides to keep the dog and names him Rocco, all the while bonding with Nadia, who agrees to care for him whenever Bob tends to the bar. While walking Rocco in a park, a passer-by, Eric Deeds comments to Bob on Rocco. Deeds later appears at Bob's house and provides proof that he is the actual owner and admits to beating and abandoning him. He demands Rocco be returned before he raises the matter with the police. | Bob and Marv find a bag at the bar, containing a severed arm with a broken watch together with the stolen money. They return the money to the Chechens, who in turn inform them that the bar will be the drop bar for the night of the Super Bowl. | Bob is unnerved when Deeds appears in the bar and reveals he is friends with Nadia. Marv informs Bob that Deeds is a dangerous thug who claims to have killed Richie Whelan. When Bob confronts Nadia, she admits that she and Deeds used to date. Nadia has scars on her neck that she reveals are from when she used to have a drug problem. Some have opined that Deeds is the source of the scars on her neck but as The Movie Spoiler points out, Nadia indicated in the movie that \"She stabbed herself with a potato peeler. That’s not who she is anymore.[7] | Marv meets and kills the other robber, then recruits Deeds to rob the bar the night of the Super Bowl. Bob is later confronted by Deeds, who demands $10,000 or he will take Rocco, after which he will starve the dog and then beat it to death. | When Marv informs Bob that he will be calling in sick on the day of the Super Bowl, Bob becomes suspicious and warns him not to do something desperate \"that they can't clean up this time\". On Super Bowl night, with Rocco in tow, Bob takes $10,000 hidden in his basement and hides it behind the bar counter together with a pistol. | Deeds breaks into Nadia's home and forces her to go to the bar with him to watch the Super Bowl. Elsewhere, Marv lines his car trunk with plastic before parking and waiting near the bar, watching various mobsters drop off money throughout the night. | Eventually the bar clears except for Deeds and Nadia. Deeds refuses Bob's offer of $10,000 for Rocco, then threatens to kill Nadia if he does not open the time lock safe during the window available at 2 AM. While they wait, Bob tells a story about Marv when he was a loan shark and how he was skimming off the Chechen mob's money. Bob once killed a customer who had hit a huge casino jackpot, using the money to replace Marv's thefts from the Chechens, and Bob disposed of the body in his heating oil tank with lye and laundry soap. He reveals to Deeds and Nadia that the victim was Ritchie Whelan, whom Deeds has always taken credit for killing. Deeds goes for his guns, but Bob is quicker and kills him. When a terrified Nadia asks if she can leave, Bob explains that although things go on all around him, he is not a part of it. | The Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and collect the money from the drop. Chovka informs Bob he was aware of Marv's deceit, then a flashback shows that Marv was killed in his car while waiting near the bar. Chovka accepts that Bob played no part in the robbery and provides him ownership of the bar as a reward. | Detective Torres visits Bob at the bar to offer condolences over Marv's death, which Bob attributes to a car jacking gone wrong, while Torres believes it was an execution. Torres asks Bob if he has seen Deeds as he has been reported missing and last seen at the bar, just as Whelan had been years earlier. Torres tells Bob of the tie between Deeds and Whelan in that Deeds always took credit for Whelan's death, but that the night Whelan went missing, Deeds was in a psyche ward and could not have been involved. Torres then implies that he knows Bob is responsible for both Deeds and Whelan's disappearance, saying, \"No-one ever sees you coming, do they, Bob?\" | Later, Bob and Rocco go to Nadia's, to allow her tell him personally if she wants to see him again. Nadia offers to take a walk with him and Rocco and goes to get her coat. The film ends as Bob hears the clinking of Nadia's shoes on the concrete coming towards him.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Drop opened in 809 theaters in North America and grossed $4,104,552, with an average of $5,074 per theater and ranking #6 at the box office.
