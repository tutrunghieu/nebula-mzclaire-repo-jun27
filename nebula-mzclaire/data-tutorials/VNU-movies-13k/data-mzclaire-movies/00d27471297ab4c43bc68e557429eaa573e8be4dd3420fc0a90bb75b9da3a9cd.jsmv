{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On an expedition in Antarctica, paleoclimatologist Jack Hall and his colleagues Frank and Jason are drilling for ice-core samples on the Larsen Ice Shelf for NOAA when the shelf breaks off. Later, Jack presents his findings on global warming at a United Nations conference in New Delhi, but fails to convince diplomats or U.S. Vice President Raymond Becker. However, Professor Terry Rapson of the Hedland Climate Research Centre in Scotland believes Jack's theories. Several buoys in the North Atlantic simultaneously show a massive drop in the ocean temperature, and Rapson concludes that melting polar ice has started to disrupt the North Atlantic current. He contacts Jack, whose paleoclimatological weather model shows how climate changes caused the first Ice Age. His team, along with NASA meteorologist Janet Tokada, builds a forecast model based on it. | Across the world, violent weather causes mass destruction. U.S. President Blake authorizes the FAA to suspend all air traffic due to severe turbulence. At the International Space Station, three astronauts see a huge storm system spanning the northern hemisphere, which soon develops into three massive hurricane-like superstorms. The eyes of these storms hold temperatures of −150 °F (−101 °C), instantly freezing anything they come into contact with. The three cells are located over Canada, Scotland, and Siberia, but will affect the entirety of their respective continents within days. | In Manhattan, New York City, Jack's son Sam learns of the worsening weather while participating in an academic decathlon. Although he promises to be on the next train home, flooding quickly closes the subways and Grand Central Terminal just as a massive storm surge generated by the freak storm hits Manhattan. Sam and a large group of people seek shelter in the New York Public Library, but not before his teammate, Laura Chapman, accidentally cut her leg. In Scotland, Rapson and his colleagues at the Hedland Centre perish in the European superstorm. | Under Jack's proposal, Blake orders the evacuation of the southern United States, with most refugees heading for Mexico, and warns the northern half of the country to seek shelters. Jack and his team set out for Manhattan to find Sam. Their truck crashes just north of Philadelphia, so the group continues on snowshoes. En route, Frank falls through the glass roof of a snow-covered shopping mall. As Jason and Jack try to pull him up, the glass under them continues cracking and Frank sacrifices himself by cutting the rope. Meanwhile, most of the group taking shelter in the library leaves when the water outside freezes against Sam's warning, leaving just Sam, his friends, and a few others who trust him. They burn books to stay warm and break into a vending machine for food. Laura appears to have a cold, so Sam confesses his feelings for her to provide comfort, and she reciprocates. At the U.S. refugee camp in Mexico, Becker learns that Blake's motorcade got caught in the superstorm; with Blake dead, Becker becomes his successor. | The next morning, Sam's group determines that Laura has blood poisoning from the cut on her leg, so Sam and two others search for penicillin in a derelict Russian cargo ship that drifted inland, and in the process discover more foods and supplies but also encounter a pack of escaped wolves from one of the city's zoos. The eye of the North American superstorm passes over the city, freezing it solid, and the three barely return to the library in time. Jack, also in the eye with an unconscious Jason, narrowly escapes the super-freeze himself in an abandoned Wendy's restaurant. | Days later, as the superstorms dissipate, Jack and Jason finally reach New York City, finding Sam's group alive. They radio this to the government-in-exile in Mexico and Becker orders search-and-rescue teams to look for other survivors throughout the northern states as he gives his first address as the President to the nation. The film concludes with the astronauts looking down amazed at the Earth from the ISS, showing most of the northern hemisphere covered in ice and snow, revealing a pristine planet.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Over its four-day Memorial Day opening, the film grossed $85,807,341; however, it still ranked #2 for the weekend, behind Shrek 2's $95,578,365 four-day tally. However, The Day After Tomorrow led the per-theater average chart with a four-day average of $25,053, compared to Shrek 2's four-day average of $22,633. At the end of its box office run, the film grossed $186,740,799 domestically and $544,272,402 worldwide. It is the second-highest opening weekend not at #1 (later beaten by Inside Out in June 2015) [1] | The film did well at the box office, grossing $544,272,402 internationally. It is the sixth-highest grossing film not to be #1 in the United States (behind My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Alvin and the Chipmunks and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs). However worldwide, it is third behind only Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Casino Royale. | The Day After Tomorrow generated mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visual effects, but criticized its writing and scientific inaccuracies. The online entertainment guide Rotten Tomatoes rated the film at 45%, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's general consensus states that it was \"A ludicrous popcorn flick filled with clunky dialogues, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster.\"[4] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, praised the film's special effects, giving the film three stars out of four. Environmental activist and The Guardian columnist George Monbiot called The Day After Tomorrow \"a great movie and lousy science.\"[5] | In a USA Today editorial by Patrick J. Michaels, who until 2007 was a Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia and who rejects the scientific evidence for global warming, Michaels called the film \"propaganda\", noting, \"As a scientist, I bristle when lies dressed up as 'science' are used to influence political discourse.\"[6] In a Space Daily editorial by Joseph Gutheinz, a college instructor and retired NASA Office of Inspector General, Senior Special Agent, Gutheinz called the film \"a cheap thrill ride, which many weak-minded people will jump on and stay on for the rest of their lives.\"[7] | Paleoclimatologist William Hyde of Duke University was asked on Usenet whether he would be seeing the film; he responded that he would not unless someone were to offer him $100.[8] Other readers of the newsgroup took this as a challenge, and (despite Hyde's protests) raised the necessary funds. Hyde's review criticized the film's portrayal of weather phenomena that stopped at national borders, and finished by saying that it was \"to climate science as Frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery\", as quoted in New Scientist. | However, Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, expert for thermohaline ocean circulation and its effects on climate, was impressed how the script writer Jeffrey Nachmanoff was well informed about the science and politics of global climate change after the talk with him at the preview of the film in Berlin. He stated: \"Clearly this is a disaster movie and not a scientific documentary, the film makers have taken a lot of artistic license. But the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right: humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment, including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes. ... Luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades (I’d be just as surprised as Jack Hall if they did occur); at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century. And the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the ‘super-storm’ depicted in the movie. Nevertheless, a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences, which we should avoid. And even without events like ocean circulation changes, climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action.\"[9] | In 2008, Yahoo! Movies listed The Day After Tomorrow as one of Top 10 Scientifically Inaccurate Movies.[10] The film was criticized for depicting several different meteorological phenomena occurring over the course of hours, instead of the possible time frame of several decades or centuries.[11] | In 2015 the Washington Post in a piece titled \"We’re closer to a ‘Day After Tomorrow’ ice age than we thought\" reported on a paper which used \"an advanced climate model at Germany’s Max-Planck Institute to simulate both conditions of global warming and conditions of an AMOC collapse\" and noting that the cited \"climate study published in Nature Scientific Reports indicates that we were naive to feel safe from “ The Day After Tomorrow ”-esque realities\" given the study's results of temperature drops of up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit in large regions amidst a still-warming globe, and given that \"current warming patterns not only indicate that a collapse of the AMOC is possible, but also that resulting consequences would resemble ' The Day After Tomorrow ,' though not to the same extremes.\"[12]","m_production":"The film was inspired by The Coming Global Superstorm, a book co-authored by Coast to Coast AM talk radio host Art Bell and Whitley Strieber.[3] Strieber also wrote the film's novelization. The book \"The Sixth Winter\" written by Douglas Orgill and John Gribbin and published in 1979, follows a similar theme. So does the novel Ice!, by Arnold Federbush, published in 1978. Shortly before and during the release of the film, members of environmental and political advocacy groups distributed pamphlets to moviegoers describing what they believed to be the possible effects of global warming. Although the film depicts some effects of global warming predicted by scientists, such as rising sea levels, more destructive storms, and disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns, it depicts these events happening much more rapidly and severely than is considered scientifically plausible, and the theory that a \"superstorm\" will create rapid worldwide climate change does not appear in the scientific literature. When the film was playing in theaters, much criticism was directed at U.S. politicians concerning their rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and climate change. The film's scientific adviser was Dr. Michael Molitor, a leading climate change consultant who worked as a negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Coming Global Superstorm 1999 novel  by Art Bell Whitley Strieber","m_directed_by":"Roland Emmerich","m_produced_by":"Roland Emmerich Mark Gordon","m_screenplay_by":"Roland Emmerich","m_story_by":"Roland Emmerich Jeffrey Nachmanoff","m_starring":"Dennis Quaid Jake Gyllenhaal Ian Holm Emmy Rossum Sela Ward","m_music_by":"Harald Kloser","m_cinematography":"Ueli Steiger","m_edited_by":"David Brenner","m_production_company":"Centropolis Entertainment Lionsgate Films The Mark Gordon Company","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"May 24, 2004 (2004-05-24) (New York City premiere) | May 28, 2004 (2004-05-28) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"124 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$125 million","m_box_office":"$544.3 million[1] | The Day After Tomorrow is a 2004 American climate science fiction disaster film co-written, directed, and produced by Roland Emmerich and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Dennis Quaid, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum, and Sela Ward.
