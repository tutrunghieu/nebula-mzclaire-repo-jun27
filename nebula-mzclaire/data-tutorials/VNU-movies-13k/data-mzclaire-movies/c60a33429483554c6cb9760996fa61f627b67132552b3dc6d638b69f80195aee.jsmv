{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"While attending college, Eddie (Peter Fonda) shares an apartment with another student, nicknamed Tarragoo (Nick Adams). Tarragoo's girlfriend Debbie (Deborah Walley) and her friend Pam (Sharon Hugueny), who is studying to be a teacher and lives with her widowed mother (Beatrice Straight), are frequent visitors. Eddie and Pam develop a close relationship; and, during the time her mother is away from home for a few days, Pam allows Eddie to stay the night. Finding herself pregnant, she tells Eddie who reacts with unhappiness, being low on funds and dismayed by the prospect of losing his scholarship. Pam discusses the situation with her mother, considers having an abortion, decides against it and makes plans to leave. Meanwhile, Eddie, with help from professors Schwartz (Malachi Throne) and Reese (Joseph Campanella), improves his educational standing by passing an exam and consults with Tarragoo and Debbie who advise him to take the morally correct path. At the crossroads of integrity, Eddie chooses rectitude and goes to Pam's mother, intent upon telling her so. Learning that Pam has already departed, he aims to follow her, with the conviction that whatever life offers, they will be able to face it together.[7]","m_cast":"Peter Fonda as Eddie Slocum | Sharon Hugueny as Pam Burns | Nick Adams as Tarragoo | Deborah Walley as Debbie | Beatrice Straight as Mrs. Burns | Malachi Throne as Prof. Schwartz | Joseph Campanella as Prof. Reese | Nancy Rennick as Mary Reese | Kent Smith as Dr. Shoemaker | Jennifer Billingsley as Karen","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"1955 novel  by Julian Halevy","m_directed_by":"Samuel Goldwyn, Jr.","m_produced_by":"Samuel Goldwyn, Jr.","m_screenplay_by":"George Garrett","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Fonda Sharon Hugueny Nick Adams Deborah Walley","m_music_by":"Sol Kaplan","m_cinematography":"Joseph Biroc Ellsworth Fredericks","m_edited_by":"William A.
