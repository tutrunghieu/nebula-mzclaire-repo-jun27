{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In New York City, Helen returns to the apartment she shares with her boyfriend Marco after enduring an unhygienic and inept abortion. Helen becomes ill and Bobby, an amiable small-time drug dealer to whom Marco owes money, shows unexpected gentleness and concern for Helen. Soon after, when Helen is hospitalized for profuse bleeding, Bobby sneaks in after visiting hours and tells her that Marco has gone away. Helen considers returning to her dysfunctional family in Indiana, but moves in with Bobby. Helen awakens to find him taking drugs, he explains that he is not an addict, but only \"chipping.\" | At Sherman Square, which has been nicknamed \"Needle Park\" because it is a hangout for drug dealers and addicts, Bobby introduces Helen to various acquaintances that make up his social group of drug customers. She meets Bobby's older brother Hank, who wears a suit and burgles for a living. In an apartment used by several addicts, Helen witnesses the intricate ritual of \"shooting up\" or preparing and injecting the heroin into a vein, and listens to their discussion of the price and availability of drugs. Later that night, Bobby take drugs, rendering him unable to make love to Helen. | When they are evicted, Bobby and Helen move into a sleazier apartment. After Bobby asks her to deliver money to Freddy, one of his suppliers. While Helen is negotiating with Freddy, Hotch, a policeman on the drug squad, and his partner arrest them. As his partner convinces Freddy to assist them in a sting, Hotch explains to Helen about what it's like when there is a \"panic.\" He explains that when the drug supply on the street is low, everyone begins to turn one another into the police, in return for favors. Unexpectedly, Hotch releases Helen without booking her and she returns to Bobby, who begins to use drugs more heavily. Helen, who all along has only observed, begins to shoot up. | Some time later, Bobby passionately looks into Helen's eyes and realizes she is using. Bobby proposes, prompting Hank to ask what they will live on, doubting Bobby's supposition that he can quit drugs. Hank offers Bobby work as a burglar, but Helen objects, saying instead that she will get a job. However, Helen quickly quits her new waitress job. Just before Bobby is to assist Hank in a burglary, he overdoses. With the aid of other users, Helen finds Bobby and helps him through the ordeal, but Hank is angry with Bobby for jeopardizing his plans. Reluctantly, he allows Bobby to assist him on another night, but the theft goes awry and Bobby is arrested. While he is in jail, Helen finds it harder to get drugs and has sex with Hank, in exchange for heroin. | When Bobby is released, he and Helen have a big fight, after which Bobby considers moving to the country, but they agree that it is not feasible. Bobby persuades Santo, a major drug dealer, to let him handle distribution in Needle Park, and is directed to an apartment where the heroin is being prepared and bagged. Meanwhile, as they are in need of immediate money, Helen turns to streetwalking. After Bobby distributes Santo's drugs, Needle Park residents are happy to have a reliable source for a while. As Helen's health deteriorates from increasing drug use, their relationship suffers. Hotch, who is not surprised to watch her fall from an innocent woman in love to a drug abusing prostitute, keeps an eye on her and, when she is arrested with her john, he asks the arresting officer not to book her, as he needs her for something he is planning. | When her mother writes, asking Helen to meet friends who are visiting the city, Helen is reluctant, but dresses up, carefully trying to hide the track marks on her arms. Instead of meeting them, however, she picks up a young virginal customer. When Bobby finds her, he scares the boy away, but then he and Helen begin to laugh. Realizing they have been too serious, they take the ferry to the countryside, where they buy a puppy. On the return trip, they discuss making a fresh start and Helen suggests that they move out of Needle Park, but Bobby refuses and convinces her to go into the men's room to shoot up. When the dog begins to whine, he puts it outside the door. Afterward, Helen discovers the dog missing and finds it just before it falls off the end of the ferry and into its machinery. | Helen goes to see Marco, who is back from his trip, but soon returns to Bobby and steals drugs from him. Needing a \"fix,\" she goes to a doctor, falsely claiming she needs drugs for a painful kidney stone. Aware that she is an abuser, the doctor gives her samples, telling her never to return. She takes some of the pills, but is arrested for selling the rest. Hotch warns her about the dangers of the women's prison and knowing that Bobby can lead them to Santo, offers Helen a deal if she will help them to catch Bobby in the act of picking up a drug shipment. | In the next two weeks, Hotch approaches Helen several times, reminding her of the pending trial. Depressed, she increases her drug use. Helen finally agrees to help the police and late one night Helen and Hotch watch, as a squad of policemen apprehend Bobby, who is in possession of a large quantity of heroin. Bobby spots her on the street and feeling betrayed, yells at her. Months later, when he is released, Helen waits for him at the gate. Although his first impulse is to rebuff her, he calls to her and they walk off together.[4]","m_cast":"Al Pacino as Bobby | Kitty Winn as Helen Reeves | Alan Vint as Narcotics Detective Hotch | Richard Bright as Hank | Kiel Martin as Chico | Michael McClanathan as Sonny | Warren Finnerty as Sammy | Marcia Jean Kurtz as Marcie | Raúl Juliá as Marco | Angie Ortega as Irene | Larry Marshall as Mickey | Paul Mace as Whitey | Nancy MacKay as Penny | Gil Rogers as Robins | Joe Santos as Detective DiBono | Paul Sorvino as Samuels | Sully Boyar as Doctor | Ruth Alda as Admitting Nurse","m_reception":"The film received generally positive reviews from critics with a fresh 78% percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert in his review gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars and said \"Movies about drug addiction are also, sometimes, hung up on the fetishes and compulsions surrounding drugs. If we get a closeup of one needle penetrating the flesh in \"The Panic in Needle Park,\" we get half a dozen. This is too many; the physical reality interrupts our identification with fictional characters. The first actor in \"Panic\" to stick the needle in, in closeup, is Warren Finnerty, who was doing the same scene 10 years earlier in Shirley Clarke's \"The Connection.\"[9]","m_production":"The film was based on a novel by James Mills, which had been based on Mills's two-part pictorial essay in the 26 February and March 5, 1965 issues of Life magazine. According to a November 1967 Hollywood Reporter news item, film rights for the novel were purchased by Avco Embassy Pictures and, according to a March 1969 Variety news item, the film rights were later bought by producer Dominick Dunne, whose brother and sister-in-law, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion wrote the screenplay.[5] | As noted in the onscreen credits, the film was shot entirely in New York City. According to the film's studio production notes, portions were shot at Needle Park and the Upper West Side area of New York City, at Riverside Park, in a New York City prison and hospital ward, on the Staten Island Ferry, and in the East Village. The studio notes reported that makeup man Herman Buchman studied the \"track\" marks on the arms of hospital patients and victims in morgues and achieved an authentic look for the actors by using a liquid called Flexible Collodian. In scenes in which actors appear to inject themselves, a registered nurse was on set, serving as a technical advisor.[5] | Originally, Ned Rorem was set to compose the score for the film until it was decided that in order to set the atmosphere, no music was to be used in the film (his isolated and unused score is included as a special feature in the Blu-ray), much of the film instead features cinéma vérité-style footage. It is believed to be the first mainstream film to feature actual drug injection.[6] | Didion and Dunne visited Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors, during the recording of the album Waiting For The Sun as he was considered for the role of Bobby, but went with Pacino instead.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Panic in Needle Park  by James Mills","m_directed_by":"Jerry Schatzberg","m_produced_by":"Dominick Dunne","m_screenplay_by":"Joan Didion John Gregory Dunne","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Al Pacino Kitty Winn Alan Vint Richard Bright Raúl Juliá Kiel Martin Paul Sorvino","m_music_by":"Ned Rorem (Isolated score)","m_cinematography":"Adam Holender","m_edited_by":"Evan Lottman","m_production_company":"Gadd Productions Corp.
