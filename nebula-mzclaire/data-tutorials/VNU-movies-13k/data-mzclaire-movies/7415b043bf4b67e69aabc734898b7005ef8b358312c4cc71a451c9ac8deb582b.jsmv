{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate an apparent break-in at the home of mathematician Alan Turing. Turing's suspicious behaviour and lack of war records triggers Nock's suspicion that he might be a Soviet spy. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park. | When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park, where, under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to break the ciphers created by the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to provide security for their radio messages. | Turing is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior. There is a flashback to 1927, when Turing was unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He developed a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks an interest in cryptography, and eventually Turing developed romantic feelings for him. Before Turing could confess his love, Morcom died from bovine tuberculosis. | Turing works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, and Jack Good pass Turing's test, but Clarke's parents will not allow her to work as the only female among male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept Enigma messages, and shares his plans with her. | Turing's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but Turing cannot determine the Enigma settings fast enough before the Germans reset the encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing is dismissed. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages—such as the word \"weather\" (as the morning messages always include a weather forecast) and the phrase \"Heil Hitler.\" After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate; however, Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken. | Turing discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals and threatens to disclose Turing's homosexuality if Turing talks. When MI6 agent Stewart Menzies tells Turing that Clarke has been taken into custody, Turing identifies Cairncross as the real spy. Menzies reveals that he knew this already and that he planted Cairncross among them in order to leak the information he wants the Soviets to have. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is homosexual and lying about never having cared for her. They break up, but she remains at Bletchley. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and not reveal what they have done. | In the 1950s, Turing is convicted of indecency and, given the choice of a jail sentence or chemical castration, he selects the latter so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. They reconcile, as she reminds him that his work saved millions of lives. | In the end, the group is seen burning the documents, and a caption reveals Alan Turing committed suicide when he was 41 years old.","m_cast":"Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing | Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke[6] | Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander[7] | Rory Kinnear as Detective Nock[8] | Allen Leech as John Cairncross[9] | Matthew Beard as Peter Hilton[10] | Charles Dance as Cdr.

Its opening box office figure was the third highest opening weekend haul for a British film in 2014. It achieved a 90% \"definite recommend\" from its core audience, according to exit poll figures. Its opening was 107% higher than that of Argo, 81% higher than Philomena and 26% higher than The Iron Lady following its debut.[54][55] | Debuting in four cinemas in Los Angeles and New York on 28 November, the film grossed $479,352 in its opening weekend with a $119,352 per-screen-average, the second highest per-screen-average of 2014 and the 7th highest of all time for a live-action film. Adjusted for inflation, it outperformed The Weinstein Company's own Oscar-winning films The King's Speech ($88,863 in 2010) and The Artist ($51,220 in 2011), which were also released on Thanksgiving weekend. The film expanded into additional markets on 12 December and was released nationwide on Christmas Day.[56][57][58] | The Imitation Game received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 90%, based on 229 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, The Imitation Game serves as an eminently well-made entry in the 'prestige biopic' genre.\"[59] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[60] The film received a grade of \"A+\" from market-research firm CinemaScore and was included in both the National Board of Review's and American Film Institute's \"Top 10 Films of 2014\".[61][62][63] | The New York Observer's Rex Reed declared that \"one of the most important stories of the last century is one of the greatest movies of 2014\".[64] Kaleem Aftab of The Independent gave the film a five-star review, hailing it the \"Best British Film of the Year\".[65][66] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post described it as a \"thoroughly engrossing Oscar-caliber movie\", while critic James Rocchi added that the film is \"strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic\".[67] Empire described it as a \"superb thriller\" and Glamour declared it \"an instant classic\".[68][69] Peter Debruge of Variety added that the film is \"beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed\".[70] Critic Scott Foundas stated that the \"movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare to chafe at society's established norms\".[71] Critic Leonard Maltin asserted that the film has \"an ideal ensemble cast with every role filled to perfection\". In addition, praise was given to Knightley's supporting performance as Clarke, Goldenberg's editing, Desplat's score, Faura's cinematography and Djurkovic's production design.[72] The film was enthusiastically received at the Telluride Film Festival and won the \"People's Choice Award for Best Film\" at TIFF, the highest prize of the festival. | Cumberbatch's performance was met with widespread acclaim from critics. TIME ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic Richard Corliss calling Cumberbatch's characterisation \"the actor's oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation\".[73][74] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times declared Turing \"the role of Cumberbatch's career\", while A.O. Scott of The New York Times stated that it is \"one of the year's finest pieces of screen acting\".[75][76] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone asserted that the actor \"gives an explosive, emotionally complex\" portrayal. Critic Clayton Davis stated that it's a \"performance for the ages ... proving he's one of the best actors working today\".[77][78] Foundas of Variety wrote that Cumberbatch's acting is \"masterful ... a marvel to watch\", Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described it as \"delicately nuanced, prickly and tragic\" and Owen Gleiberman of the BBC proclaimed it an \"emotionally tailored perfection\".[79][80] It's \"a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll\" declared Dave Calhoun of Time Out.[81] In addition, Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded in her review, \"It's Cumberbatch's nuanced, haunted performance that leaves the most powerful impression\".[82] The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy reported that the undeniable highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, \"whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work\".[83][84] Critic Roger Friedman wrote at the end of his review, \"Cumberbatch may be the closest thing we have to a real descendant of Sir Laurence Olivier\".[85] | While praising the performances of Cumberbatch and Knightley, Catherine Shoard of The Guardian stated that the film is \"too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message\".[86] Tim Robey of The Telegraph described it as \"a film about a human calculator which feels ... a little too calculated\".[87] Some critics also raised concerns about film's alleged reluctance to highlight Turing's homosexuality.[88] British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian in November 2014, pointed out many historical inaccuracies in the film, saying in conclusion: \"Historically, The Imitation Game is as much of a garbled mess as a heap of unbroken code\".[89] Journalist Christian Caryl also found numerous historical inaccuracies, describing the film as constituting \"a bizarre departure from the historical record\" that changed Turing's rich life to be \"multiplex-friendly\".[90] L.V. Anderson of Slate magazine compared the film's account of Turing's life and work to the biography it was based on, writing, \"I discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park\".[91] Andrew Grant of Science News wrote, \"... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license – which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling.\"[92] | Despite earlier reservations, Turing's niece Inagh Payne told Allan Beswick of BBC Radio Manchester that the film \"really did honour my uncle\" after she watched the film at the London Film Festival in October 2014. In the same interview, Turing's nephew Dermont Turing stated that Cumberbatch is \"perfect casting. I couldn't think of anyone better\". James Turing, a great-nephew of the code-breaker, said Cumberbatch \"knows things that I never knew before. The amount of knowledge he has about Alan is amazing\".[93]","m_production":"Before Cumberbatch joined the project, Warner Bros. bought the screenplay for a reported seven-figure sum because of Leonardo DiCaprio's interest in playing Turing.[12][13][14][15][16] In the end, DiCaprio did not come on board and the rights of the script reverted to the screenwriter. Black Bear Pictures subsequently committed to finance the film for $14 million.[4][17][18] Various directors were attached during development including Ron Howard and David Yates.[19] In December 2012, it was announced that Headhunters director Morten Tyldum would helm the project, making the film his English-language directorial debut.[20][21] | Principal photography began on 15 September 2013 in England. Filming locations included Turing's former school, Sherborne, Bletchley Park, where Turing and his colleagues worked during the war, and Central St Martin’s School of Art Campus on Southampton Row in London.[22] Other locations included towns in England such as Nettlebed (Joyce Grove in Oxfordshire) and Chesham (Buckinghamshire). Scenes were also filmed at Bicester Airfield and outside the Law Society Building in Chancery Lane. Principal photography finished on 11 November 2013.[23] | The bombe seen in the film is based on a replica of Turing's original machine, which is housed in the museum at Bletchley Park. However, production designer Maria Djurkovic admitted that her team made the machine more cinematic by making it larger and having more of its internal mechanisms visible.[24] | The film's title refers to Turing's proposed test of the same name, which he discussed in his 1950 paper on artificial intelligence entitled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[25] | The Weinstein Company acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for US distribution rights at the European Film Market.[26] The film is also a recipient of Tribeca Film Festival's Sloan Filmmaker Fund, which grants filmmakers funding and guidance with regard to innovative films that are concerned with science, mathematics, and technology.[27]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Alan Turing: The Enigma  by Andrew Hodges","m_directed_by":"Morten Tyldum","m_produced_by":"Nora Grossman | Ido Ostrowsky | Teddy Schwarzman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Benedict Cumberbatch | Keira Knightley | Matthew Goode | Rory Kinnear | Charles Dance | Mark Strong","m_music_by":"Alexandre Desplat","m_cinematography":"Óscar Faura","m_edited_by":"William Goldenberg","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"StudioCanal (United Kingdom) | The Weinstein Company (United States)","m_release_dates":"August 29, 2014 (2014-08-29) (Telluride Film Festival) | November 28, 2014 (2014-11-28) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"114 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States[2][3]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$14 million[4]","m_box_office":"$233.6 million[5] | The Imitation Game is a 2014 American historical drama thriller film directed by Morten Tyldum, with a screenplay by Graham Moore loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges (previously adapted as the stage play and BBC drama Breaking the Code). It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as real-life British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during World War II. | The film's screenplay topped the annual Black List for best unproduced Hollywood scripts in 2011. The Weinstein Company acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for U.S. distribution rights at the European Film Market. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on November 14 and the United States on November 28. | The Imitation Game was a commercial and critical success. It grossed over $233 million worldwide against a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It was nominated in eight categories at the 87th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Tyldum), Best Actor (Cumberbatch), and Best Supporting Actress (Keira Knightley). It won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. It garnered five nominations in the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and was nominated in three categories at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, including Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. It also received nine British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominations, including Best Film and Outstanding British Film, and won the People's Choice Award at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival. | The LGBT civil rights advocacy and political lobbying organisation the Human Rights Campaign honoured The Imitation Game for bringing Turing's legacy to a wider audience. However, the film was criticised for its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and Turing's character and relationships. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE IMITATION GAME (12A)\".
