The second day Giovanni has to cancel the jogging with Andrea due to an urgent call from one of his patients. Andrea goes with friends to go scuba diving instead. Unable to make it back to the surface in time after following a fish into a cave, Andrea dies, without being able to be reconciled with his father.
