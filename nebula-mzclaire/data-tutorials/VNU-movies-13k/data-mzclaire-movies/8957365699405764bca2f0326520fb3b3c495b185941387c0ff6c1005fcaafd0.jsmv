{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is an adaptation of poet and memoirist Jim Carroll's (Leonardo DiCaprio) juvenile diaries chronicling his kaleidoscopic free-fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction. As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad, Jim's life centers on the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. A best friend who is dying of leukemia, a coach (\"Swifty\") who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team, teenage sexual angst, and an appetite for cocaine and heroin all begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. | Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin, for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim \"picked up a game\" now and then, he is able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in Riker's Island. After months in prison, he leaves and later does a talk show about his drug life, after turning down free drugs from his old friend, Pedro.","m_cast":"Leonardo DiCaprio as Jim Carroll | Lorraine Bracco as Mrs. Carroll | Marilyn Sokol as Chanting Woman | James Madio as Pedro | Patrick McGaw as Neutron | Mark Wahlberg as Mickey | Roy Cooper as Father McNulty | Bruno Kirby as Swifty | Alexander Chaplin as Bobo | Juliette Lewis as Diane Moody | Michael Imperioli as Bobby | Michael Rapaport as Skinhead | Ernie Hudson as Reggie | Manny Alfaro as Manny | Cynthia Daniel as Winkie | Brittany Daniel as Blinkie | Jim Carroll as Frankie Pinewater, Credited as James Dennis Carroll","m_reception":"The film currently holds a 46% \"Rotten\" rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[2] Roger Ebert gave two stars out of four, concluding, \"At the end, Jim is seen going in through a \"stage door,\" and then we hear him telling the story of his descent and recovery.
