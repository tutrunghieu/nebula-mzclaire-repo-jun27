{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protégé of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. | When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company. | A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts, then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward. Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton's career to seek revenge for Zabel's suicide. | Jake, aided by Gekko, learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field owned by Churchill Schwartz. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton offers Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. In his new position, Jake convinces Chinese investors to fund the fusion research by Dr. Masters (Austin Pendleton) he has been supporting. Bretton is impressed even more. | Jake attends a fundraiser with Winnie and pays for a seat at a table for Gekko priced at $10,000. Gekko confronts Bretton about what he did to him and also to Zabel. Bretton mocks him that no one cares what Gekko knows or thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko then follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, particularly her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he paid for the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him somewhat. | As the economy starts to crumble, Bretton and business mentor Julius Steinhardt (Eli Wallach) advise federal regulators what drastic actions must be taken. Jake's mother continues to come to him for large sums of money. Winnie then announces to Jake she is pregnant with a boy. After riding motorcycles together, Bretton reveals to Jake that the Chinese investment is going into solar panels and fossil fuels instead of fusion research, leaving Jake furious and feeling betrayed. | Gekko proposes a solution, using a $100 million trust fund account in Switzerland, which Gekko set up for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the research and save the company. She signs the money over to Jake, who then entrusts it to Gekko to legitimize the funds for investment in the fusion research company. However, the money never arrives, and Gekko betrays his daughter and Jake by leaving the country with Winnie's $100 million. Jake realizes that Gekko has been using him to get the money in the account for his own gain. Winnie then tells Jake to leave, no longer trusting him. | Gekko is now in London, running a hugely successful hedgefund-like financial company, capitalized by the $100 million. Jake travels there to propose one last trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandson's life. Gekko, however, refuses. | Jake pieces together everything from Keller Zabel's collapse to the economic bailout of Bretton's company and gives the information to Winnie, telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. Winnie runs the story, and Bretton James is exposed. The investors, including Steinhardt, promptly abandon Bretton and go to Gekko on the back of his $1.1 billion return as Bretton finds himself under intense legal scrutiny by the government. | Jake has successfully reunited with Winnie in New York, when late one night Gekko appears and tells them that he deposited $100 million into the fusion research's account anonymously. He apologizes to them. One year later, Gekko is seen at his grandson Louis's first birthday party, along with Jacob's mother and Jacob and Winnie's friends.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"In early 2007, The New York Times reported that a sequel to Wall Street, then tentatively titled Money Never Sleeps, had entered pre-production and was in the early stages of development with a screenplay by Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker.[30][31] Shortly after the film was confirmed, Douglas was reported to be interested in reprising his role as Gordon Gekko, depending on the script. In October 2008, 20th Century Fox announced that it had officially green-lit the film and would serve as a distributor.[32][33] In the same month it was announced that Allan Loeb had been approached to write a script that was being referred to as a \"page one rewrite\", meaning that he would be starting \"from scratch\".[34] Shortly after the film had entered pre-production it was announced that both Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah would not be involved with the sequel for unknown reasons.[30] Despite stating that Sheen was not going to return, Stone confirmed he would briefly reprise his role as Bud, which would be worked into the script.[35] | Around May 2007, The New York Times reported that Stone had turned down the opportunity to direct the film, even after months of being pressured to do so by Douglas, among others.[30] However, in April 2009 Fox confirmed that Stone would be returning as both director and producer,[36] alongside Douglas and Edward R. Pressman. Stone stated that he reconsidered passing on directing the film after the stock market crash.[37] The film was co-produced by Eric Kopeloff with Alessandro Camen and Celia D. Costas serving as executive producers. In addition to screenwriter Loeb, the film's overall writer is Schiff. Bryan Burrough received credit as a consultant, and may have done uncredited work on the story. | At the time of the film's announcement the plot details were kept under wraps, but Loeb later confirmed that its plot would primarily focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more \"chaotic\" financial world than the one he once oversaw from the previous film.[31] Its budget was reported to be between $60 million ($50 million with the tax credits)[38][39] and $70 million.[23] Money Never Sleeps was being used as the film's working title[40] before being renamed Wall Street 2 at the director's request[41] and finally changed to Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. As part of research for the film, Douglas and Stone had a dinner meeting with Samuel D. Waksal, the founder of the bio-pharmaceutical company ImClone Systems, who spent five years in federal prison for securities fraud.[42] LaBeouf, along with Stone, discussed the financial collapse with multiple hedge fund managers.[42] | Early in mid-2009, Stone took LaBeouf to a cocktail party organized by Nouriel Roubini, a New York University economics professor and chairman of a consulting firm. There, Stone and LaBeouf discussed the financial collapse with Roubini and also discussed hedge fund managers who are clients of Roubini's firm. Roubini said that \"in this financial crisis it was the traditional banks and the investment banks that had a larger role in doing stupid and silly things than the hedge funds.\"[42] Stone also stated that he had conversations with Jim Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager who had urged him to focus less on hedge funds and more on the banking system, Chanos said, \"there was a much more important story, a bigger story, in what happened with the system.\"[22] | In October 2008, 20th Century Fox confirmed that Allan Loeb, who is a licensed stock broker, had been selected to re-write the script.[43] Stanley Weiser had worked on a treatment for a sequel set in the present with Gekko being released from jail; the second part would be set in China. The studio felt that the material was dated, and put the project in turnaround. Stone had a falling out with Pressman, the producer, and began work on W. with Weiser.[44] Weiser's treatment for Wall Street Two was discarded and the film began taking shape from an original script by Stephen Schiff.[45] It was reported that Aaron Sorkin had turned down the opportunity to work on the film's script.[46] | During December 2008, while still in the process of drafting, Loeb said that he had been riveted by the Bernie Madoff headlines and showed interest in referencing him in the film, noting: \"the thing that is so crazy about this story is that Ponzi schemes seem to be the simplest low-class scam,\" and \"but this was carried out in the highest echelon of high finance. You couldn't even get in to see this guy unless you had $2 million to invest.\"[47] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be \"a crook running a Ponzi scheme\" which is \"legal robbery.\"[48] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script,[49][46][50] feeling Loeb's draft was \"so great\" that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.[50] | Sometime in early June, Loeb reportedly handed in his second draft of the film to Fox,[50] and in July, was finalizing the screenplay.[51] Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is based in four locations; New York, London, the United Arab Emirates, and an Asian country.[46][52] One of the character consultants to the new film will be billionaire Vincent Tchenguiz. Pressman said that Tchenguiz had modeled Gekko but did admit that Gekko was \"partly Milken\" and that Gekko will be a more outwardly altruistic figure but, admits, \"a leopard doesn't change its spots, despite appearances.\"[52] Pressman said of the origin of the film's subtitle: \"Wall Street was New York-centric. Today the markets are much more global, hence the title of the new film, Money Never Sleeps.\"[52] He described Gekko's involvement in the film as being \"larger than life\".[52] | It was reported that Loeb had taken advice from a \"number of real Wall Street movers and shakers\" to ensure \"horrifying accuracy\" for the film's script.[53] Of the re-writes done to script, Stone said: \"We sort of started over with the story of a young man who is at the center of it, and how he needs Gordon Gekko's help to navigate those waters.\"[54] In a reference to the GEICO Gecko commercial, which was suggested by New York Governor David Paterson, Gekko says \"even a caveman could do it\" in the movie.[27] At the request of Mulligan and LaBeouf, the filmmaker cut some dialogue from the character's break-up scenes, which he at first was initially hesitant to do.[18] | Stone said that the film will provide more of a social commentary and admitted that he had never expected high finance to \"serve again as a tableau for his storytelling\". He also added that its plot will showcase the unemployment rate at an all-time high and the \"our national debt ever climbing.\"[55] Discussing the difference between Wall Street and its sequel, the director explained, \"In the other movie, Charlie Sheen is corrupt at the beginning and he finds a path to integrity. In this movie, it starts out the other way. Shia and Carey are idealists. And their idealism is being threatened.\"[56] A writer for USA Today believed that the film's story line \"attempts to put the complicated financial schemes that led to the worldwide economic collapse on a human scale.\"[56] | A shift in location in the sequel reflected some of the changes in the world since then: while the New York Stock Exchange and its trading floor had featured heavily in the first film, they are less prominent in the second. Instead, more time is spent at the Federal Reserve Building, reflecting its new position as a \"bulwark of the system\" according to Stone.[42] The location provided a link to the contemporary crisis the film examines, since September 2008 it has been an important site for meeting on the crisis.[42] | Although August 10 was reportedly the start date,[1][50] principal photography began on September 9.[57] The filmmaker continued to make additions to the script and meet with financial consultants about the project whilst filming.[5] Mulligan was able to film all of her scenes in 15 days.[58] Stone said that they were on schedule and on budget, but claimed that the constantly changing weather was a problem for filming.[59] He also said that the filming on location process was similar to the first film.[60] While filming, LaBeouf said that Douglas was an \"opened wound on the set\" due to his oldest son's arrest in July for drug trafficking, adding that Stone filmed a \"struggling\" Douglas.[61] | Charlie Sheen was able to shoot his scene in one day and described being on set with the director and Douglas as strange, with Stone adding that it was difficult for the actor.[5] Sheen reportedly had trouble remembering his lines[5] and required some prodding to remember his cue during the party scene in which Gekko encounters Fox.[62] Although eager to meet him, LaBeouf did not interact with Sheen on set per request.[5] Regarding working with the director, who has a reputation for being demanding on his cast, Douglas described him as being mellow, but acknowledged that \"it's still always a workout with him.\"[5] \"Everyone was very friendly, but the scene work felt dangerous,\" LaBeouf recalls of the on-set atmosphere. \"These guys aren't going to coddle you. Douglas was the one who comforted me. And I've never gone deeper with a director than Oliver. He's the Easter bunny and Orson Welles in one man.\"[5] The young actor further discussed Stone's work ethic on-set with him, saying: | We'd be on the street [filming], and Oliver would just say, \"Go to that bar, get fucked-up, and come back.\" I'd walk over, get smashed, and go back to work. He would really fuck with me when I was smashed. I get aggressive when I'm smashed, and he'd film that. He would just open you up completely, make you fucking naked – and then call, \"Action!\"[61] | Douglas filmed the opening scene,[27] which is Gekko being released from Sing Sing maximum-security prison, in Ossining, Westchester County, on September 18.[63] Stone felt that the prison scene was a \"key plot element\" because there is no one there to meet Gekko, who returns to society as an outsider.[27] Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world, the director clarified that there is \"very little space to do those kind of tricks in this movie\" because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis.[27] Filming took place in Fordham University for the classroom scenes on October 10 and 11.[64] In order to shoot a dining scene between LaBeouf and Douglas, Shun Lee West closed for 24 hours so the two could film scenes at the restaurant for the entire day of November 10.[65] Brolin and Stone found extras simply by asking workers, at places like RdV, if they would like to be a part of the sequel.[66]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters  by Stanley Weiser Oliver Stone","m_directed_by":"Oliver Stone","m_produced_by":"Edward R.

It stars Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, Frank Langella, Susan Sarandon and, in his final film role before his death in 2014, Eli Wallach. | The film takes place in New York, 23 years after the original, and revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. Its plot centers on a reformed Gordon Gekko, played by Douglas, acting as an antihero rather than a villain, and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie (Mulligan), with the help of her fiancé, Jacob (LaBeouf). | Principal photography took place in New York between September and November 2009. After having its release date moved twice, Money Never Sleeps was released theatrically worldwide on September 24, 2010, by 20th Century Fox. Prior to its official release, many journalists connected to the financial industry were reportedly shown advance screenings of the film. | Despite opening to positive reception at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Money Never Sleeps received polarized reviews from critics, who generally praised the acting, but considered it an unnecessary sequel. Though failing to meet its critical expectations, the film was successful at the box office, topping the United States's ranking during its opening weekend, and earning a worldwide total of $134 million in ticket sales, and more than $15 million on DVD. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Finke, Nikki (June 2, 2009). \"Hedge Fund Is Villain In Oliver Stone's Wall Street 2: Shia LaBeouf & Javier Bardem Set To Star With Michael Douglas\".
