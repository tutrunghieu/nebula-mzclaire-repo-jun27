{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1941, Mamie Stover (Jane Russell), a San Francisco prostitute, is chased away from the city by several policemen. On a freighter to Honolulu, she meets Jim Blair (Richard Egan), a successful writer who thinks of Mamie as a Cinderella-like beauty. Flattered, Mamie enjoys not being associated with her former occupation and falls in love. A shipboard romance is cut short when Mamie notices Jim being welcomed ashore by his sweetheart Annalee (Joan Leslie). | As they part, Jim lends Mamie $100 to help her build a career. She visits an old friend, Jackie Davis (Jorja Curtright), who introduces her to Bertha Parchman (Agnes Moorehead), the mean-spirited owner of a dance hall cantina. Even more cold-hearted is Bertha's vicious and sadistic manager Harry Adkins (Michael Pate), who beats any rule breaking hostesses working at the club. Mamie applies for a job, although according to Bertha's rules and other thirteen rules restricting prostitutes in Honolulu, she is not allowed to have a boyfriend, visit Waikiki Beach, or open a bank account in order to avoid taxes. | Mamie earns enough money to pay back her debt to Jim, so she invites him to the club. Jim learns that Mamie has become the main attraction of the club, having acquired the nickname \"Flaming Mamie.\" She is disappointed by Jim's disapproval and rejects an offer to return to the mainland. She does convince him to rekindle their friendship which puts a strain on his relationship with Annalee, who is jealous of the amount of attention that Jim is giving Mamie. In the meantime, she persuades Jim to manage her money and write a check to her father on her behalf. Seeing a response addressed to \"Mrs. Jim Blair\" upsets Jim, but he reluctantly agrees to go along. He defends Mamie when Harry beats her up for going out with him. | The bombing of Pearl Harbor causes Jimmy to frantically search for Mamie and decide they should marry when he returns from the military. The war temporarily fades Mamie's personal setbacks. She purchases multiple properties cheaply and rents them. Jim convinces Mamie to leave the dance hall while he is on leave. Returning to the club to announce her resignation, Mamie finds out that Harry has been fired for encounters with the military police. Bertha, fearing the loss of the club's biggest attraction, promises to make Mamie a star and offers her half of the profits, as well as a respectable mailing address to deceive Jim when writing him. | Misleading Jim does not work, though, as someone sends him a promotional poster of Mamie, posing for a club performance. Before he can respond, he is hit and wounded by a bomb. When granted convalescent leave, he returns to Hawaii to confront Mamie. After an argument, Jim concludes that their lives are too different and leaves her for good. A heartbroken Mamie leaves Hawaii. In San Francisco at the ship to airport transfer, she tells a police officer that she gave away her fortune and is returning to her hometown in Mississippi.[3]","m_cast":"Jane Russell as Mamie Stover | Richard Egan as Jim Blair | Joan Leslie as Annalee Johnson | Agnes Moorehead as Bertha Parchman | Michael Pate as Harry Adkins | Richard Coogan as Capt.
