{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film opens with the statement: \"What you are about to see is inspired by true events. According to the FBI, there are an estimated 1.4 million violent crimes in America each year. On the night of February 11, 2005, Kristen McKay and James Hoyt left a friend's wedding reception and returned to the Hoyt summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known\". It is followed by a recorded 911 call of a boy screaming that he and his friend found two bodies lying in blood in an old vacation house. | The film then moves to the present. A young couple, Kristen and James, arrive at the remote vacation house. James had proposed to Kristen there, but she refused, saying that she is not ready for marriage. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., a young blonde woman, whose face is obscured by low lighting, knocks on the front door asking for Tamara. When told by James and Kristen she is at the wrong house, she asks if they're sure, then leaves with the caveat that she will \"see them later\". | Due to the tension between him and Kristen, James leaves to buy cigarettes for her. Kristen hears another knock on the door; she refuses to open it after realizing that it is the woman from earlier, who has returned to ask for Tamara again. Kristen hears strange noises, and her cell phone goes missing. When she hears a noise from the back door, she grabs a large kitchen knife and opens the curtains covering the glass door to find a man wearing a sack mask staring back at her. Panicked, she hides in the bedroom until James returns. She explains what just transpired and James goes to investigate. He finds his car ransacked and the blonde woman, now wearing a doll mask, watching him from afar. His phone has had its battery stolen and he realizes the house has been breached. | The couple attempt to leave in James's car, but a third stranger wearing a pin-up girl's mask drives a pick-up truck into the car, totaling it and forcing them to flee. Back in the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun. Mike arrives to help, but James, mistaking him for one of the intruders, shoots him dead. A devastated James remembers an old radio transmitter in the backyard shed. He leaves the house and encounters and attempts to shoot the blonde woman, but is ambushed and stopped by the masked man. | Kristen hears a shot and runs to the shed. She finds the radio and tries to contact someone for help. Another masked woman appears and smashes the radio. Kristen rushes back to the house, where she is confronted by the blonde woman, who is now armed with a knife. The masked man arrives with the captured James and the gun and incapacitates Kristen. Both James and Kristen are now unconscious. | When James and Kristen wake up, they are tied to chairs in the living room, with the masked strangers standing before them. Kristen asks them why they are doing this, and the blonde woman replies \"because you were home\". The strangers unmask themselves and stab Kristen and James before leaving in the pick-up truck. As they drive away in their pick-up truck they drive past two young boys who are distributing religious tracts. Dollface gets out of the pick-up truck to ask for a tract. The boy asks her if she's a sinner and she replies \"Sometimes\" and he gives her the tract. When she returns to the car, the Pin-Up Girl tells her \"It will be easier next time.\" The two young boys come to the house, finding the destroyed car in the yard and the front door open. They enter the house and discover the bodies of Kristen and James. Kristen, who is still alive, wakes up and screams.","m_cast":"Liv Tyler as Kristen McKay | Scott Speedman as James Hoyt | Gemma Ward as Dollface | Kip Weeks as Man in the Mask | Glenn Howerton as Mike | Laura Margolis as Pin-up girl | Alex Fisher and Peter Clayton-Luce as Mormon boys","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Director Bryan Bertino also wrote the film's script, which was originally titled The Faces.[3][4] Bertino took a particular interest in the horror genre, noting how one can connect to an audience by scaring them. He also stated that he was significantly inspired by thriller films of the 1970s while writing the film.[3] | According to production notes,[3] the film was inspired by true events from Bertino's childhood: a stranger came to his home asking for someone who was not there, and Bertino later found out that empty houses in the neighborhood had been broken into that night:[5] | As a kid, I lived in a house on a street in the middle of nowhere. One night, while our parents were out, somebody knocked on the front door and my little sister answered it. At the door were some people asking for somebody who didn't live there. We later found out that these people were knocking on doors on the area and, if no one was home, breaking into the houses\".[3] | In interviews, Bertino stated he was \"very impressed\" with some of the theories circulating on the Internet about the \"true events\" the movie is allegedly based on, but said that his main inspiration was the true crime book Helter Skelter about the Manson Family murders; some have said that the film was also inspired by the Keddie Cabin Murders of 1981 that occurred in a small vacation community in California's Sierra Nevada.[6][7][8] The French horror film Them (2006) has a very similar plot. | When casting the two leading actors in the film, Bertino wanted Liv Tyler for the part of Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, agreed to participate in the film after reading its script:[9] \"I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I knew it would be interesting to act that.\"[3] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that \"the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages\".[3] | In casting the three masked intruders, Bertino chose Australian fashion model Gemma Ward for the part of Dollface, feeling she had the exact \"look\" he had imagined. In preparing for the role, Ward read Helter Skelter for inspiration. Kip Weeks was then chosen as the Man in the Mask, and television actress Laura Margolis, who found the script to be a real \"page turner\", was cast in the part of Pin-Up Girl.[3][10] | On a $9 million budget, filming for The Strangers began on October 10, 2006, and finished in early 2007. It was shot on location roughly 10 miles outside of Florence, South Carolina, and the 2,000-square-foot (190 m2) house interior was constructed by a set crew.[11] Though the film takes place in 2005, the house itself was deliberately constructed with an architecture reminiscent of 1970s ranch houses and dressed in furnishings applicable to the era.[10] The property was located on the outskirts of Timmonsville, South Carolina. During production, it was reported that Liv Tyler came down with tonsillitis due to the extensive screaming the role required her to do.[3] Despite weather complications, the film was largely shot in chronological order.[3] | In late July 2007, Bertino, Tyler and Speedman attended San Diego's annual Comic-Con event to promote the film; all three were present for a questions-and-answers panel session, as well as a screening of the film's official teaser trailer;[12] this trailer was released on the internet several weeks later, and can be found on YouTube.[13] It was not until March 2008 that a full-length trailer for the film was released, which can be found on Apple's QuickTime trailer gallery.[14] The trailer originally began running in theaters attached to Rogue Pictures' sci-fi film Doomsday (2008) in March 2008, and television advertisements began airing on networks in early-mid April 2008 to promote the film's May release. Two one-sheet posters for the film were released in August 2007, one showing the three masked Strangers,[15] and the other displaying a wounded Liv Tyler.[16] In April 2008, roughly two months before the film's official theatrical debut, the final, official one-sheet for the film was released,[17] featuring Liv Tyler standing in a darkened kitchen with a masked man looming behind her in the shadows.","m_sequel":"Rogue Pictures' producers confirmed to Variety that a sequel is in the works, tentatively titled The Strangers: Part II.[36][37] The film will be written by Bryan Bertino and directed by Laurent Briet.[38][39] Shock Till You Drop reported that Realitivity Media put The Strangers: Part II on hold because they found that the movie might not be in their interest, even though Universal Pictures is willing to release it.[39] However, Rogue Pictures confirmed in January 2011 that the sequel is now in production, and was supposed to begin filming as early as April 2011. The plot follows a family of four who have been evicted from their home due to the economy, and are paid a visit by the same three strangers from the first film.[39][40] It is not known whether the sequel will receive a theatrical or a straight-to-DVD release.[41] Liv Tyler will return as Kristen McKay while the original three masked villains are also set to return, however, in an interview Tyler had announced that she would only have a minor role. | Tyler claimed that Part II would be released in 2014,[41][42][43] but this did not occur. | In January 2015, it was stated the sequel was back on track.[44] | Relativity Media and GK Films originally scheduled the film for an December 2, 2016 release.[45] However, it was later taken off the schedule.","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Bryan Bertino","m_produced_by":"Doug Davison Roy Lee Nathan Kahane Sonny Mallhi","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Liv Tyler Scott Speedman Glenn Howerton","m_music_by":"tomandandy","m_cinematography":"Peter Sova","m_edited_by":"Kevin Greutert","m_production_company":"Vertigo Entertainment Mandate Pictures Intrepid Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Rogue Pictures","m_release_dates":"May 30, 2008 (2008-05-30) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"85 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$9 million[2]","m_box_office":"$82.4 million[2] | The Strangers is a 2008 American horror thriller film written and directed by Bryan Bertino and starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman as a young couple who are terrorized by three masked assailants. | Produced on a budget of $9 million and after two postponements, the film was released theatrically in North America on May 30, 2008.
