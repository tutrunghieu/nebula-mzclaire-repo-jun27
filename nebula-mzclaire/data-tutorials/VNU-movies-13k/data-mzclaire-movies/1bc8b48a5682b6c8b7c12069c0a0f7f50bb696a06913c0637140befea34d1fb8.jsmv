{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"While diving, Matt Farrell (Ashley) is kidnapped by Neva Gordon (Pat Woodell) and Steinman (Jan Merlin) and taken to an island where Neva's father Dr. Gordon (Charles Macauly) is experimenting, trying to make a \"super race\" by combining humans and animals. His creations are Ayesa the Panther Woman (Grier), Kuzma the Antelope Man (Ken Metcalfe), Darmo the Bat Man (Tony Gosalvez), Primo the Ape Man (Kim Ramos) and Lupa the Wolf Woman (Mona Morena). Another creation, Doro the Boar Man, is shot down by Steinman while trying to flee early in the film. Dr. Gordon wants Farrell to be one of his upcoming experiments, but Neva begins to doubt her fathers' work after a botched experiment on another test subject, Juan Pereira (Eddie Garcia). After she is splattered with blood during the surgery, Neva decides to help Farrell and the animal people escape. As Steinman and his men hunt them down, Ayesa turns completely savage and is killed. A fierce gun battle begins, and Farrell kills Steinman. Most of the other animal people are also killed, except Darmo, who is now able to fly and returns to the compound to attack Steinman's men. Dr. Gordon tries to escape, but is confronted and killed by the tree woman who used to be his wife. At the end, Farrell and Neva watch as Darmo flies off.","m_cast":"John Ashley as Matt Farrell | Pat Woodell as Neva Gordon | Jan Merlin as Steinman | Charles Macauly as Dr. Gordon | Pam Grier as Ayesa the Panther Woman | Ken Metcalf as Kuzma the Antelope Man | Tony Gosalvez as Darmo the Bat Man | Kim Ramos as Primo the Ape Man | Mona Morena as Lupa the Wolf Woman | Eddie Garcia as Juan Pereira | Angel Buenaventura as Angel","m_reception":"The film was very popular and remained one of Ashley's favorites.[1]","m_production":"The film was originally made for New World Pictures, then run by Roger Corman and Lawrence Woolner.
