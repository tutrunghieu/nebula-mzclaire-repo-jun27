{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Hill's prologue, a scientist, Dr. Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), is fired from his job at a honey farm for experimenting with wasps. | The founder and owner of a large cosmetics company, Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. | Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature. Eventually, Zinthrop throws a jar of carbolic acid at her face, and another character uses a chair to push her out of a window, killing her.","m_cast":"Susan Cabot as Janice Starlin | Fred Eisley as Bill Lane | Barboura Morris as Mary Dennison | William Roerick as Arthur Cooper | Michael Mark as Dr. Eric Zinthrop | Frank Gerstle as Les Hellman | Bruno VeSota as Night Watchman | Roy Gordon as Paul Thompson | Carolyn Hughes as Jean Carson | Lynn Cartwright as Maureen Reardon | Frank Wolff as Delivery Man | Lani Mars as Secretary | Philip Barry as Delivery Man","m_reception":"The Wasp Woman received mixed to negative reception from critics upon its release.
