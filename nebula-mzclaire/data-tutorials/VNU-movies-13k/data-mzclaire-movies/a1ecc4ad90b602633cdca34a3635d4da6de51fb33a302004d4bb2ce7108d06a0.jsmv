The film portrays the life of Renate Müller, a German film actress who died in 1937 in mysterious circumstances. A variety of rumours about Müller's death had developed, but the filmmakers chose to portray it as suicide following Nazi pressure over her relationship with a Jewish diplomat. Following legal objections from Müller's family, the ending was toned down to make her final fate more vague.[1] | Leuwerik recreates scenes and songs from several of Müller's films. However their star personae were very different, with Müller famous as a girl-next-door while Leuwerik played the role in her more usual refined fashion. Although set in the 1930s, stylistically the film often resembles the late 1950s.[2] Willy Fritsch, a German star of the 1930s who had acted alongside Müller in two films, appears in a small role.[3] | The film was moderately successful commercially on its release in West Germany.[4] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Bergfelder p.111 | ^ Bergfelder p.112-114 | ^ Bergfelder p.114 | ^ Bergfelder p.112","m_external_link":"Sweetheart of the Gods at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Liebling_der_G%C3%B6tter.jpg/220px-Liebling_der_G%C3%B6tter.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"George Hurdalek"}
