Described by its director as a \"mythical interpretation\" of childhood,[2] the film weaves elements of vampirism, Surrealism, black comedy, and religious zealotry throughout its narrative about the perceptions and fantasies of an impressionable young boy in 1950s America. The film places the majority of its action outdoors around the dilapidated farms and in the wheat fields of Idaho shot in idyllic sunlight which belies the dark secrets of the characters and plot. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE REFLECTING SKIN (15)\".
