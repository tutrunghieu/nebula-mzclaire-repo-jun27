{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Katya, a poor and desperate widow, and her young son Sanya try to survive in the post-World War II Soviet Union during the late 1940s through the early 1950s. While on a train, the two meet a handsome, rakish officer, Tolyan, who seduces the mother. Katya stays with Tolyan, who pretends to be her husband and acts as a stepfather to Sanya, who is at first highly distrustful of the man, resenting his presence and authority. There are several allusions to Hamlet. | Through his good looks, apparent generosity, and his status as a war veteran, Tolyan charms his way into a variety of lucrative positions. Katya and Sanya both realize the harsh and increasingly abusive nature of the new head of their family, but, although alarmed, neither mother nor child seems willing to leave the man. The extent of Tolyan's love for his new family remains ambiguous throughout the film and provides one of the more compelling elements of the story.","m_cast":"Vladimir Mashkov as Tolyan | Yekaterina Rednikova as Katya | Misha Philipchuk as Sanya (as Misha Filipchuk) | Amaliya Mordvinova as the doctor's wife | Lidiya Savchenko as Baba Tanya | Yuliya Artamonova as the engineer's wife | Yury Belyayev as Sanya (at 48 years old) | Dmitri Chigaryov as Sanya (at 12 years old)","m_reception":"Sozvezdie 1997: Best Actor - Vladimir Mashkov | Venice Film Festival 1997: Prize of the International Youth Jury - Pavel Chukhrai President of the Italian Senate's Gold Medal - Pavel Chukhrai UNICEF Award - Pavel Chukhrai | Open CIS and Baltik Film Festival 1997: Best Actor - Vladimir Mashkov Best Director - Pavel Chukhrai Prize of the Distributors Jury - Pavel Chukhrai | Nika Awards 1998: Best Actor - Vladimir Mashkov Best Actress - Ekaterina Rednikova Best Director - Pavel Chukhrai Best Film - Pavel Chukhraj and Igor Tolstunov Best Music - Vladimir Dashkevich | Young Artist Award 1998: Best Young Performer in a Foreign Film - Misha Philipchuk | Venice Film Festival 1997: Golden Lion - Pavel Chukhrai | European Film Awards 1997: Best Film - Igor Tolstunov | Golden Globe Award Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film - Russia | Academy Award 1998: Oscar Award for Best Foreign Language Film - Russia | Nika Awards 1998: Best Cinematographer - Vladimir Klimov Best Costume Designer - Natalya Moneva Best Production Designer - Viktor Petrov Best Screenplay - Pavel Chukhrai Best Sound - Yuliya Yegorova | Goya Awards 1999: Best European Film - Pavel Chukhrai","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Pavel Chukhrai","m_produced_by":"Igor Bortnikov Sergei Kozlov Igor Tolstunov","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Vladimir Mashkov Yekaterina Rednikova Misha Philipchuk","m_music_by":"Vladimir Dashkevich","m_cinematography":"Vladimir Klimov","m_edited_by":"Marina Dobryanskaya Natalya Kucherenko","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"1997 (1997) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 minutes","m_country":"Russia","m_language":"Russian","m_budget":"$2 million","m_box_office":"$1.1 million (US) | The Thief (Russian: Вор, Vor) is a 1997 Russian drama film written and directed by Pavel Chukhrai.
