{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story follows the adventures of the Waterbury children, who are forced to move with their mother (Dinah Sheridan) from a luxurious Edwardian villa in the London suburbs to \"Three Chimneys\", a house near the fictional 'Great Northern and Southern Railway' in Yorkshire, as their father (Iain Cuthbertson), who works at the Foreign Office, has been imprisoned as a result of being wrongly accused of selling state secrets to the Russians. | The three children, Roberta (Bobbie) (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren), find amusement in watching the trains on the nearby railway line and waving to the passengers. They become friendly with Albert Perks (Bernard Cribbins), the station porter, and with the Old Gentleman (William Mervyn) who regularly takes the 9:15 down train. Meanwhile, to earn money to survive during her husband's absence, Mother writes and sells stories to magazines. | They have many adventures, including saving the lives of dozens of passengers by alerting a train to a landslide, rescuing a Russian dissident, Mr Szczepansky, and uniting him with his family, and caring for Jim, the grandson of the Old Gentleman, who is injured whilst participating in a paper chase. Finally, Bobbie discovers the truth of her father's absence and appeals to the Old Gentleman for his help. He is eventually able to help prove their father's innocence, and the family is reunited.","m_cast":"Jenny Agutter as Roberta 'Bobbie' Waterbury | Sally Thomsett as Phyllis Waterbury | Gary Warren as Peter Waterbury | Dinah Sheridan as Mother, Mrs. Waterbury | Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks | William Mervyn as Old Gentleman | Iain Cuthbertson as Father, Charles Waterbury | Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest | Ann Lancaster as Ruth | Gordon Whiting as Szczepansky (pronounced \"Shapanski\") | Beatrix Mackey as Aunt Emma | Deddie Davies as Mrs. Nell Perks | David Lodge as Band Leader | Christopher Witty as Jim (The runner in the railway tunnel and the old gentlemans grandson) | Brenda Cowling as Mrs. Hilda Viney | Paddy Ward as Cart Man | Erik Chitty as Photographer | Sally James as Maid | Dominic Allan as CID Man | Andy Wainwright as Desk Sergeant | Amelia Bayntun as Cook (uncredited) | Bob Cryer (Chairman of the K&WVR) as guard of train returning father (uncredited)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Sally Thomsett was cast as the 11-year-old[i] Phyllis, despite being 20 years old at the time. Her contract forbade her to reveal her true age during the making of the film and she was also not allowed to be seen smoking or drinking during the shoot.[2] 17-year-old Jenny Agutter played her older sister, Roberta, and Gary Warren played their brother, Peter. Dinah Sheridan was cast as Mother, and Bernard Cribbins as Perks the porter. | Lionel Jeffries used the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, and its station at Oakworth, as the backdrop for the film, referring to it as the \"Great Northern and Southern Railway\".[3] At the time of filming there were still very few heritage railways in Britain, and only the KWVR could provide a tunnel, which is important in a number of scenes. The tunnel is a lot shorter in reality than it appears in the film, for which a temporary extension to the tunnel was made using canvas covers.[4] | A number of working locomotives were used in the making of the film, including MSC67, 5775 (L89), 52044 (Preserved as L&Y 957) and 4744 (69523/1744), all of which survive. They were painted in fictional liveries for the filming; 5775 in brown, reminiscent of the Stroudley livery of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, 957 in apple green, similar to liveries used by the North Eastern Railway, Great Northern Railway and London and North Eastern Railway, and 4744 and MSC67 in plain black, as used by most railway companies in Britain at one time or another. 67 is now at the Middleton Railway, Leeds, and 4744 is now with the Great Central Railway at Loughborough. 5775 and 957 are still on the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway. As of 2014, 4744 is the only locomotive that remains operational as 957, 5775 and 67 are on static display at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, National Railway Museum Shildon and the Middleton Railway respectively. | A wide variety of vintage rolling stock was used in the film, including examples from the Metropolitan and London and North Eastern railways. Although different carriages appeared in different liveries, the dominant one is white and maroon, which is reminiscent of the livery of the Caledonian Railway. The most important carriage in the film, the Old Gentleman's Saloon, was a North Eastern Railway Director's Saloon, that has been used since in the stage production of the book. It and all the other carriages seen in the film are still at the KWVR, but tend to be used at special events only, due to their age. | A number of different locations were employed for various scenes. The house called \"Three Chimneys\" is in Oxenhope, just north of the Oxenhope railway station.[5] The Bronte Parsonage in Haworth was used as the location for Doctor Forrest's surgery.[5] The scenes of the children sitting on a bridge were filmed at Wycoller near Colne. Mytholmes Tunnel near Haworth, and the railway line running through it, were used extensively in the film, including being the location for the paper chase scene, as well as the one in which the children wave the girls' petticoats in the air to warn the train about a landslide. The landslide sequence itself was filmed in a cutting on the Oakworth side of Mytholmes Tunnel and the fields of long grass where the children waved to the trains are situated on the Haworth side of the tunnel. A leaflet, \"The Railway Children Walks\", is available from KWVR railway stations or the Haworth Tourist Information Centre.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lionel Jeffries","m_produced_by":"Robert Lynn","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jenny Agutter","m_music_by":"Johnny Douglas","m_cinematography":"Arthur Ibbetson","m_edited_by":"Teddy Darvas","m_production_company":"EMI Elstree","m_distributed_by":"MGM-EMI (UK) Universal Pictures (USA)","m_release_dates":"21 December 1970 (1970-12-21) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£500,000[1] | The Railway Children is a 1970 British drama film based on the novel of the same name by E.
