{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"New York City police detective Joe Leland (Frank Sinatra) is called to the home of a murder victim who has been beaten to death, head crushed and has had his genitals removed. Puzzled and disgusted, the police on call are left bemused, and Leland holds things together with his direct, no-nonsense approach. | Few leads are found, other than the fact that a house-mate of the victim remains conspicuous by his absence. All the while notions about the victim's sexuality and personal interests warp the ideals of the officers assigned to the task. Leland tries to remain focused on the case while dealing with the breakdown of his marriage to wife Karen (Lee Remick). | Eventually, the victim's housemate is identified as Felix Tesla (Tony Musante), and he is soon tracked down by Leland and another detective. A psychologically disturbed Tesla cracks until eventually Leland coaxes a confession out of him. This results in extensive publicity, a promotion for Leland and the electric chair for Tesla, which distresses Leland because it is clear to him that Tesla is insane. | Later, across town, a man kills himself by jumping from the rooftop of a racetrack. The case goes unnoticed until the wife of the dead man, Norma MacIver (Jacqueline Bisset), comes to Leland's office and asks him to look into it, believing something far more complex is involved. | Leland and partner Dave Schoenstein (Jack Klugman) follow leads. A psychiatrist, Dr. Roberts (Lloyd Bochner), clearly knows more about the dead man, Colin MacIver (William Windom), than he's willing to reveal. The therapist also is familiar with Karen Leland, whose infidelity is putting a great strain on the detective's home life and distracting him from his work. | Leland soon learns that certain powerful interests in the city do not want him to ask questions. The incorruptible detective presses on, at risk to his career and life, as he discovers a lurid relationship between the man's suicide and the previous murder.","m_cast":"Frank Sinatra as Det. Sgt.

Their divorce became final in August 1968, putting an end to a short-lived romance of barely two years.[3]","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Detective 1966 novel  by Roderick Thorp","m_directed_by":"Gordon Douglas","m_produced_by":"Aaron Rosenberg","m_screenplay_by":"Abby Mann","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Frank Sinatra Lee Remick Jacqueline Bisset","m_music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith","m_cinematography":"Joseph Biroc","m_edited_by":"Robert L.

Here, the detective in question is Joe Leland, who is trying to juggle marital issues with a murder case that seemed to be open-and-shut at first, but runs much deeper than he could have imagined. | The Detective was Sinatra's fourth collaboration with director Douglas, having worked together on 'Young at Heart (1954), Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964), Tony Rome (1967), and then later Lady in Cement (1968). |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Solomon, Aubrey.
