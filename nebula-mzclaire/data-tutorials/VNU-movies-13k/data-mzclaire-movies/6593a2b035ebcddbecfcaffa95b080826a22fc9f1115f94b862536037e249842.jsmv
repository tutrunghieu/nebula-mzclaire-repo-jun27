Set in present-day Montana, it explores the tension and mistrust that can characterize interactions between Native Americans and White Americans. | Filming largely took place on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana. A few scenes were filmed in Glacier National Park and in the town of Cut Bank, Montana. | A group of re-enactors attempt to stage a hundred-year anniversary battle between US Cavalry and Blackfeet Indians. Unfortunately racial hostilities and a real gun lead to some all too real casualties, and three young Blackfeet men are caught in the middle. The film follows their flight for freedom in the face of an angry community which has mistakenly blamed them for the violence.","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"War Party (1989)\".
