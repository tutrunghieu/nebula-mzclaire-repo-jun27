{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose, using the drag pseudonym of Mitzi Del Bra, is a Sydney-based drag queen who accepts an offer to perform his drag act at Lasseter's Hotel Casino Resort managed by his estranged wife named Marion in Alice Springs, a remote town in central Australia. After persuading his friends and fellow performers, Bernadette Bassinger, a recently bereaved transgender woman, and Adam Whitely, a flamboyant and obnoxious younger drag queen who goes under the drag name Felicia Jollygoodfellow, to join him, the three set out for a four-week run at the casino in a large tour bus, which Adam christens \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\". | While on the long journey through remote lands bordering the Simpson Desert, they meet a variety of characters, including a group of friendly Aboriginal Australians for whom they perform, the less accepting attitudes of rural Australia in such towns as Coober Pedy, and are subjected to homophobic abuse, violence, including having their tour bus vandalized with the words \"AIDS fuckers go home\". | When the tour bus breaks down in the middle of the desert, Adam spends the whole day repainting it lavender to cover up the vandalism. The trio later meet Bob, a middle-aged mechanic from a small outback town who joins them on their journey. Before they arrive at Alice Springs, Tick reveals that Marion is actually his wife, as they never divorced, and that they are actually going there as a favour to her. Continuing their journey, Adam is almost mutilated by a homophobic gang before he is saved by Bob and Bernadette. Adam is shaken and Bernadette comforts him, allowing them to reach an understanding. Likewise, the others come to terms with the secret of Tick's marriage and resolve their differences. Together, they fulfil a long-held dream of Adam's, which, in the original plan, is to climb Uluru in full drag regalia (\"A cock in a frock on a rock\"), although the location was changed to King's Canyon in the film (see below). | Upon arrival at the hotel, it is revealed that Tick and Marion also have an eight-year-old son, Benjamin, whom Tick has not seen for many years. Tick is nervous about exposing his son to his drag profession and anxious about revealing his homosexuality, though he is surprised to discover that Benjamin already knows and is fully supportive of his father's sexuality and career. By the time their four-week stint at the resort is over, Tick and Adam head back to Sydney, taking Benjamin back with them, so that Tick can get to know his son and Marion can have a long-earned break. However, Bernadette decides to remain at the resort for a while with Bob, who has decided to work at the hotel after the two of them had become close.","m_cast":"Terence Stamp as Ralph Waite/Bernadette Bassinger Daniel Kellie as young Ralph | Hugo Weaving as Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose/Mitzi Del Bra | Guy Pearce as Adam Whitely/Felicia Jollygoodfellow Leighton Picken as young Adam | Bill Hunter as Robert \"Bob\" Spart | Sarah Chadwick as Marion Barber | Mark Holmes as Benjamin Barber | Julia Cortez as Cynthia Campos | Ken Radley as Frank | Margaret Pomeranz (uncredited) as Adam's mother | Stephan Elliott (uncredited) as Doorman","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert had originally been conceived by filmmakers Stephan Elliott and Andrena Finlay, who were at the time in production of a film called Frauds. They initially tried to pitch Priscilla to various financiers at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, but were unsuccessful,[4] and so instead took the film's concept to PolyGram and, with the backing of the Australian Film Finance Corporation, were able to begin production of the film on a relatively low budget of 2.7 million Australian dollars. | Elliott and the film's producers, Michael Hamlyn and Al Clark, the latter of whom was the husband of Finlay, all agreed to work for $50,000 each, a relatively low fee for filmmakers at the time, while the lack of funding meant that the crew agreed to receive takings of the film's eventual profits in compensation for their low salaries.[5] Due to the involvement of the Australian FFC, only one non-Australian actor was allowed to appear in the film, and Clark initially considered David Bowie, whom he had known back in the 1980s, and later briefly thought of John Hurt, although neither were available.[6] | In May 1993, after travelling around the Australian Outback searching for appropriate sites to film in, Priscilla's creators attended the Cannes to advertise their project, despite the fact that they had not yet confirmed any actors for the roles. Their primary choice for the role of Bernadette was Tony Curtis, who read and approved of the script, but eventually became unavailable. They then approached John Cleese, who was not interested. | For the part of Tick, they had initially wanted Rupert Everett and for Adam they wanted Jason Donovan.[7] However, at a pre-production casting meeting held at Cannes, Everett and Donovan did not get on well with one another and were found to be openly hostile toward the production staff. In light of this, it was readily agreed that they would not be suitable for the parts[8] and the search for their three leading men would resume. However, Donovan would go on to play Tick in the West End musical adaptation of the film to great acclaim. | After unsuccessfully lobbying Colin Firth to play the role, producers eventually awarded the part to Hugo Weaving. Initially considering Tim Curry for the part of Bernadette, they cast Terence Stamp, who was initially anxious about the role because it was unlike anything that he had performed previously, although he eventually came on board with the concept.[9] Stamp himself suggested Bill Hunter for the role of Bob, who accepted the role without even reading the script or being told anything about the greater concept of the film other than the basic character description, while Australian soap-opera star Guy Pearce was hired at the eleventh hour direct from the Australian soap opera Neighbours to portray the sassy but sprite Adam.[10] | It is striking what an effect the disguise of drag is having on [the actors'] personalities. It makes Guy [Pearce] flirtatious, combative and loud. It makes Terence [Stamp] withdrawn and watchful (\"Hello sailor,\" he greets me warily with his back to the wall, looking like a fallen woman in a '50s melodrama.) It makes Hugo extraordinarily trashy. | Many scenes, including one where Bernadette encounters a butch, bigoted, Australian woman named Shirley, were filmed at the Outback town of Broken Hill in New South Wales, largely in a hotel known as Mario's Palace, also small scenes filmed in the All Nations Hotel, which Al Clark believed was \"drag queen heaven\".[12] They also decided to film at Coober Pedy, a rough-and-tumble mining town in Central Australia featured prominently in the film.[13] | Initially, they tried to get permission to film upon the geological formation formerly known as Ayers Rock or \"the Rock\" (Uluru), but this was rejected by organizations responsible for the monument, such as the Uluru Board of Management, as it would have been in violation of Indigenous Australian religious beliefs.[14] Instead, the scene was filmed in King's Canyon.[15] Dialogue from the scene was rewritten slightly to accommodate the new location. | With filming over, the director and producers began editing the footage, repeatedly travelling to both London and to Los Angeles, which had then just been hit by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. On the advice of early viewers, the film was shortened and scenes such as Adam's flashback about his pedophilic uncle were edited down.[16]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stephan Elliott","m_produced_by":"Al Clark | Michael Hamlyn","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Terence Stamp | Hugo Weaving | Guy Pearce | Bill Hunter","m_music_by":"Guy Gross","m_cinematography":"Brian J.

The plot follows two drag queens played by Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce and a transgender woman, played by Terence Stamp, as they journey across the Australian Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in a tour bus that they have named \"Priscilla\", along the way encountering various groups and individuals. The film's title is a pun on the fact that in English speaking cultures, \"queen\" is a slang term for a drag queen or female impersonator. | The film was instrumental in bringing Australian cinema to worldwide attention[2] and for its positive portrayal of LGBT individuals, helping to introduce LGBT themes to a mainstream audience. | The film received predominantly positive reviews and won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design at the 67th Academy Awards. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival[3] and became a cult classic in both Australia and abroad. Priscilla subsequently provided the basis for a musical, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, which opened in 2006 in Sydney before travelling to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, and New York City's Broadway. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT (15)\".
