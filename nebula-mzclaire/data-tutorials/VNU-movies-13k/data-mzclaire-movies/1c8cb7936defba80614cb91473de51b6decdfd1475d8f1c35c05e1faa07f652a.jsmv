{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Gary King (Simon Pegg), a middle-aged alcoholic, tracks down his estranged schoolfriends and persuades them to complete \"the Golden Mile\", a pub crawl encompassing the 12 pubs of their hometown of Newton Haven. The group had previously attempted the crawl as teenagers in 1990 but failed to reach the final pub, The World's End. | Gary arrives in Newton Haven with friends Peter (Eddie Marsan), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Andy (Nick Frost), and they begin the crawl. In the second pub, the group is briefly joined for a drink by Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike), whose affections Gary and Steven fought over in school. At the third pub, Gary is turned away due to being barred as a teenager, but drinks some beer left behind on a table outside. In the toilets of the fourth pub, Gary picks a fight with a teenager and knocks his head off, exposing a blue blood-like liquid and subsequently exposing him as an alien android. Gary's friends join him and fight more androids, whom they refer to as \"blanks\" to disguise what they are talking about. | They decide to continue the pub crawl so as not to make the androids suspicious of their actions, as Gary had told various people that they were doing the Golden Mile. At the seventh pub, the group runs into Sam again. In the garden, Gary, Sam and Steven get into a fight with androids impersonating Sam's twin friends, making Sam convinced of the androids' invasion after previously not believing Gary. At the eighth pub, androids impersonating attractive girls from their youth attempt to seduce Gary, Andy and Peter, while Basil, a man whom they had spoken to in their previous pub crawl in 1990 and who had been known for making wild theories, explains to Steven the details of the android invasion. At the ninth pub, Guy Shepherd (Pierce Brosnan), their old schoolteacher, encourages them to accept their fate and be replaced by androids. Andy realises that Oliver has been replaced with an android after seeing the return of his birthmark, which he had earlier told he had removed with cosmetic laser treatment, and crushes his head with a barstool. Another fight breaks out and the group scatters. Gary and Sam escape the pub together and Gary tells her to leave for her own safety. | Once reunited, the four remaining friends accuse each other of having been replaced by androids, but prove that they are human. At this point, it is revealed that earlier in their adult life, Gary had betrayed Andy and allowed him to be arrested and almost killed, explaining Andy's hostility towards Gary. The androids close in on the group and capture Peter after he picks a fight with the android representing his former childhood enemy, but Gary is determined to finish the pub crawl. However, Andy refuses and demands that they return to London, knocking Gary out in the process to make him go with them. Andy and Steven find that to get to the car, they must go through the tenth pub, where Gary wakes up. After having his tenth pint, he decides to carry on alone, which leads to Andy chasing after him. After quickly having a drink at the eleventh pub, he runs towards the final pub, the World's End. Steven is overwhelmed by the androids while attempting to drive the car away, and Andy continues to chase Gary towards the final pub. | At the World's End, Andy confronts Gary. In the quarrel, Andy reveals that his wife has left him, and realises that Gary attempted suicide in the years since school. As he tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, they discover a hidden chamber and are reunited with Steven. A disembodied alien entity, the Network (Bill Nighy), reveals that the limited android invasion has been responsible for all of humanity's advances in telecommunications in recent decades, bringing humanity closer together as a first step to joining the galaxy's community of planets. The Network offers the men the chance to contribute to Earth joining the galactic community, even offering them eternal youth by becoming androids, but they refuse as they point out the numerous flaws in The Network's plan. Exasperated, the Network abandons the invasion after Gary manages to prove that the Network had to replace nearly all of the citizens in the town to make it acceptable enough for its standards. Sam arrives just in time to drive the group out of Newton Haven as it self-destructs. | Some time later, Andy recounts this story around a campfire in the ruins of London. The destruction of Newton Haven triggered a worldwide chain reaction that wiped out modern technology and sent humanity back to the Dark Ages. The remaining androids have reactivated and are mistrusted by surviving humans. Andy's marriage has recovered, Steven is in a relationship with Sam, android Peter returned to his family, and android Oliver returned to his estate agent's job (with a new head made out of a football). In the ruins of Newton Haven, the now-sober Gary enters a pub with the younger android versions of his friends and orders five glasses of water. When the bartender refuses to serve androids, Gary draws a sword and leads his android friends into a brawl.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The World's End earned £2,122,288 ($3,242,064 USD) during its UK opening weekend, losing the top spot to Monsters University. Its weekend grosses were higher than Shaun of the Dead's £1.6 million but lower than Hot Fuzz's £5.4 million.[24] | In the United States, the movie was released on 23 August and earned $3.5 million on its opening day, beating out The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and You're Next. The World's End also had the highest per-theater average out of all films in theaters throughout the country on its opening day.[25] On its opening weekend, the film landed in fourth place with $8,790,237, behind Lee Daniels' The Butler, We're the Millers, and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.[26] This exceeded box office expectations ranging from $7 million[27] to $8.5 million,[28] and The World's End's opening weekend earned the most out of all films in the Cornetto Trilogy.[29] | The World's End received critical acclaim. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an 89% approval rating with a weighted average score of 7.5/10 based on 202 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Madcap and heartfelt, Edgar Wright's apocalypse comedy The World's End benefits from the typically hilarious Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, with a plethora of supporting players.\"[30] The film also holds a Metacritic score of 81 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\", based on 45 collected reviews.[31] | Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, praising it as \"hilarious\" and the \"best\" collaboration of Wright, Pegg and Frost, saying that \"these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs... The finale is a little too shaggy and silly. But what do you expect after a dozen beers?\"[32] Mark Dinning of Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, writing: \"Bravely refusing to rigidly adhere to a formula that has been so successful, Wright, Pegg and Frost's Cornetto Trilogy closer has tonal shifts you won't expect, but the same beating heart you've been craving.\"[33] Movie blog eatpraymedia gave the film four and a half stars, calling it \"...the perfect antidote to big budget movie making.\"[34] Henry Barnes of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five, writing: \"With this final film they've slowed down a bit, grown up a lot. And saved the richest bite until last.\"[35]","m_production":"Principal photography for The World's End began on 28 September 2012.[11] Filming took place in Hertfordshire, at Elstree Studios, Letchworth Garden City, and Welwyn Garden City.[12] Part of the film was also shot at High Wycombe railway station, Buckinghamshire.[13] | All twelve pubs in the film use identical signage on menus and walls, reflecting what Wright called \"that fake hand-written chalk\" common to modern British pubs.[9] The exteriors of the real pubs were shot at locations in Welwyn Garden City and Letchworth Garden City, with altered signage.[14] Letchworth Garden City railway station got a makeover as the \"Hole in the Wall\".[15] Stunts were coordinated by Brad Allen of martial arts film director Jackie Chan's team. Wright said: \"In Drunken Master, Jackie Chan has to get drunk to fight, but this is more the idea of Dutch courage. You know, when you're kind of drunk and you think 'ah, I can climb up that scaffolding!' Or just that you're impervious to pain. One of the things we talked about is this idea that [the characters] become better fighters the more oiled they get.\"[9] | The Broadway Cinema, Letchworth, a renovated independent cinema built in a quintessentially Art Deco style in the 1930s,[16] was used to portray the Mermaid pub. This cinema was also the first outside London to play the film, with a special introduction by Pegg thanking the residents of Letchworth for their help during its making; over 800 viewers watched the film at the cinema on its opening night.[17]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Edgar Wright","m_produced_by":"Nira Park | Tim Bevan | Eric Fellner","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Simon Pegg | Nick Frost | Paddy Considine | Martin Freeman | Eddie Marsan | Rosamund Pike","m_music_by":"Steven Price","m_cinematography":"Bill Pope","m_edited_by":"Paul Machliss","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures (International) | Focus Features | (United States)","m_release_dates":"10 July 2013 (2013-07-10) (Leicester Square) | 19 July 2013 (2013-07-19) (United Kingdom) | 23 August 2013 (2013-08-23) (United States) |  | ","m_running_time":"109 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom | United States[2]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$20 million[3]","m_box_office":"$46.1 million[4] | The World's End is a 2013 British comic science fiction film directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan.
