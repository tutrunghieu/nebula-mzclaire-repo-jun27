{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Johnny is a successful banker who lives in a San Francisco townhouse with his fiancée, Lisa. They share an intense intimate relationship characterized by constant, passionate lovemaking. Despite this idyllic existence, Lisa has inexplicably become dissatisfied with her life, and one afternoon confides to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds Johnny boring. Although Michelle advises her to be grateful for what she has, and her mother counsels her that financial stability is more important than happiness, Lisa decides to seduce Johnny's best friend, Mark. Although he is initially reluctant, Mark gives in to Lisa's advances. Their affair continues through the remainder of the film, even though Mark appears reluctant at the outset of each sexual encounter and repeatedly tries to break off the relationship. Lisa, meanwhile, having come to the realization that she \"wants it all\", decides to stay with Johnny for financial support and the material goods he can provide her. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attaches a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover. | Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, numerous subplots involving secondary characters begin to develop: Denny, a neighboring college student whom Johnny financially supports and \"loves like a son\", has a mysterious run-in with an armed drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take to the police. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction; once Johnny tells Denny that Lisa loves him as her friend, Denny resolves to propose to his own girlfriend. Johnny takes on a mysterious client at his bank whose identity he is sworn to protect. Claudette experiences real estate problems, bemoans failed relationships, and informs Lisa that she definitely has breast cancer. Michelle and her boyfriend, Mike (Scott Holmes), break into[8] Johnny and Lisa's home to have sex. Peter (Kyle Vogt), a psychologist friend of Johnny and Mark's, alternates between defending Lisa and assessing her as a sociopath, which results in Mark briefly trying to murder him. Each subplot receives little exposition, and none is ever resolved. | At a surprise birthday party for Johnny a previously unseen friend of Lisa and Johnny's whose name is not revealed - although the character is named \"Steven\" in the credits - catches Lisa kissing Mark while the rest of the guests are outside and confronts her about the affair. Lisa expresses no remorse, while Mark angrily urges Steven not to tell anyone. Johnny announces to the guests that he and Lisa are expecting a child, only for Lisa to tell Steven and Michelle that she lied about it in order to \"make it interesting\". At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who physically attacks Mark. | After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom, prompting Lisa to make plans to leave him for Mark. Johnny finally comes out of the bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone, and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Claiming that all of his friends have betrayed him, Johnny destroys his apartment and then kills himself with the pistol earlier recovered from Chris-R. Denny, Mark and Lisa discover Johnny's body sometime later. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark declaring he does not love Lisa and never wants to see her again. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the sound of the approaching sirens grow louder.[9] | In addition to being rife with continuity errors, the film has several plots, subplots and character details whose inconsistencies have been noted by critics and audiences. The Portland Mercury has pointed out that a number of \"plot threads are introduced, then instantly abandoned\".[10] One of the most notable examples of this is in an early scene, when halfway through a conversation about planning a birthday party for Johnny, Claudette off-handedly tells Lisa: \"I got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer.\"[11] The issue is casually dismissed and never revisited during the rest of the film.[10][11] In addition, the audience never learns the details surrounding Denny's drug-related debt to Chris-R or what led to their violent confrontation on the roof.[10][12] | Beyond being Johnny's friend, Mark's background receives no exposition; when he is first introduced he claims to be \"very busy\" while sitting in a parked car in the middle of the day, with no explanation ever given as to his occupation or what he was doing. Greg Sestero stated in his memoir The Disaster Artist that he created a backstory for the character in which Mark was an undercover vice detective, which Sestero felt united several otherwise disparate aspects of Mark's character (such as the secretive nature of various aspects of his behavior including marijuana use, his mood swings, and his handling of the Chris-R incident); however, Wiseau dismissed adding any reference to Mark's past to the script.[8] The makers of The Room video game would later introduce a similar idea as part of a subplot involving Mark's unexplained backstory, much to Sestero's amusement. | In perhaps the most infamous example of the film's narrative flaws, the principal male characters congregate in an alley behind Johnny's apartment to play catch with a football while wearing tuxedos. When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his beard, and the camera slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the soundtrack. Nothing that is said or occurs during the game has any effect on the plot; the scene ends abruptly with the men deciding to return to Johnny's apartment after Peter trips while trying to catch the ball. Wiseau received enough questions about the scene that he decided to address it on a Q&A segment featured on the DVD release; rather than explaining the scene, though, Wiseau only states that playing football without the proper protective equipment is fun and challenging.[13] Greg Sestero has been questioned about the significance of Mark's shaving, though his only response for several years was \"if only you knew\".[14] Sestero would eventually reveal in The Disaster Artist that Wiseau insisted he shave his beard on-set just so that Wiseau would have an excuse for Johnny to call Mark \"Babyface\", Wiseau's own nickname for Sestero. Sestero further detailed how the football-in-tuxedos scene was concocted on set by Wiseau, who never explained the significance of the scene to the cast or crew and insisted that the sequence be filmed at the expense of other, relevant scenes.[8]","m_cast":"Tommy Wiseau as Johnny | Greg Sestero as Mark | Juliette Danielle as Lisa | Philip Haldiman as Denny | Carolyn Minnott as Claudette | Robyn Paris as Michelle | Scott Holmes as Mike | Dan Janjigian as Chris-R | Kyle Vogt as Peter | Greg Ellery as Steven","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Room originated as a play, completed by Wiseau in 2001.[3][15] Wiseau supposedly then adapted the play into a 500-page book, which he was unable to get published.[10] Frustrated, Wiseau decided to adapt the work into a film, which he would then produce himself in order to maintain total control over the project.[10][16] | Wiseau has been secretive about exactly how he obtained the funding for the project, but he did tell Entertainment Weekly that he made some of the money by importing leather jackets from Korea.[3] According to Sestero in his book The Disaster Artist, Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began, having amassed a fortune over several years of entrepreneurship and real estate development in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco.[8] The budget for The Room reached $6 million, all of which was spent on production and marketing.[3] Wiseau has claimed that the reason the film was relatively expensive was because many members of the cast and crew had to be replaced, and each of the cast members had several understudies.[11] According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that unnecessarily inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets.[8] Sestero further claims that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot due to Wiseau's inability properly to remember his lines or move to the appropriate place on camera.[8] | According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau came to the Birns and Sawyer film lot, rented a studio, and bought a \"complete Beginning Director package,\" which included the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras.\"[17] Wiseau, confused about the differences between 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate.[8][10] Explaining his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said that he wanted to be able to say that he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35 mm footage was used in the final edit.[8] | Wiseau has claimed in many interviews[which?] that while casting the film, he selected his group of actors from among \"thousands\" of head shots, yet nearly the entire cast of The Room had never before been in a full-length film. For example, The Room was the first film in which Carolyn Minnott had ever appeared.[18] Greg Sestero, who had known Wiseau for some time before production began, had limited film experience and had only agreed to work with Wiseau as part of the production crew. On the first day of filming, Wiseau fired the actor originally hired to play Mark, and Sestero agreed to fill in. He would later admit to being uncomfortable filming his sex scenes; because of this, he was allowed to keep his jeans on while shooting them.[14] | Greg Ellery has claimed that Juliette Danielle was just \"off the bus from Texas\" when shooting began, and that on the first day of shooting, \"the cast watched in horror\" as Wiseau jumped on Danielle and immediately began filming their \"love scene\".[17] Sestero has disputed this chronology, stating that the sex scenes were among the last to be filmed.[8] Wiseau has claimed that Danielle was originally one of three or four understudies for the Lisa character, and was selected after the original actress left the production.[11] According to Danielle, the original actress cast to play Lisa was closer in age to Wiseau and had an accent Danielle described as \"random\"; per Sestero, the actress was \"Latina\" and came from an unidentified South American country.[8] Danielle further claims that she had originally been cast as Michelle, but was given the role of Lisa when the original actress was dismissed from the production because her \"personality...didn't seem to fit\" the character.[19] Danielle further corroborates that multiple actors were dismissed from the production prior to filming, including another actress hired to play Michelle.[19] | Kyle Vogt, who played Peter, told the production team at the outset of filming that he only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project. Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time his schedule ran out, and he left the production despite the fact that Peter was to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. His lines in the last half of the film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.[14][17][20] | The original script was significantly longer than the one used during filming, and featured a series of lengthy monologues; it was edited on-set by the cast and script supervisor, who found much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, one anonymous cast member claimed that the script contained \"stuff that was just unsayable. I know it's hard to imagine there was stuff that was worse. But there was\".[3] Sestero maintains that Wiseau was adamant characters say their lines the way they were written, but that several cast members managed to slip in ad libs that ended up in the final cut of the film.[14] | Sestero recalls in his book The Disaster Artist that Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures.[8] Sestero recounts how, at the outset of production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. Wiseau eventually decided to drop the subplot after learning that there was no practical way to film the flying car scene on the production's budget.[8] | The script is characterized by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop in the middle of a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's has been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused not to laugh.[8] In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.[8] | Much of the dialogue is repetitive, especially that of Johnny, whose speech is partially composed of a series of catchphrases: he begins almost every conversation in the film with the salutation \"Oh, hi!\" and ends most conversations by saying \"That's the idea\". Many of the principal characters use the phrase \"Don't worry about it\" to dismissively end conversations, and Lisa often ends discussions about Johnny by saying \"I don't want to talk about it\". Almost every male character in the film has dialogue discussing Lisa's physical attractiveness, including an unnamed friend of Johnny's whose only line of dialogue in the film is \"Lisa looks hot tonight\". Despite the significant amount of dialogue regarding Johnny and Lisa's forthcoming wedding, no character ever uses the words \"fiancé\" or \"fiancée\", only referring to Johnny as Lisa's \"future husband\" or Lisa as Johnny's \"future wife\". | Principal photography lasted six months. It was mainly shot on a Los Angeles soundstage, but some second unit shooting was done in San Francisco, California. The film's many rooftop sequences were shot on the soundstage, with exteriors of San Francisco later greenscreened in.[3] A behind the scenes feature reveals that some of the roof scenes were shot in August 2002. The film employed over 400 people, and Wiseau is credited as an actor, an executive producer, the writer, producer, and director. Two others are credited as executive producers, but according to Sestero, one of them had no involvement in the film and the other had died years prior to filming.[21] Wiseau had a number of problems with his behind-the-camera team, and replaced the entire crew twice.[3] Some people had multiple jobs on the film; for example, in addition to playing the role of Mark, Sestero also worked as a line producer, assistant to Tommy Wiseau, and helped with casting.[20] Wiseau frequently forgot his own lines or missed cues, requiring numerous retakes and on-set direction from the script supervisor; as a result, much of his dialogue had to be re-dubbed in post production.[22] | The score was written by Loyola Marymount University music professor Mladen Milicevic. Milicevic went on to do the score to Wiseau's 2004 documentary Homeless in America, and was later hired to do the score on the 2016 documentary on The Room, Room Full of Spoons. | The soundtrack features four R&B slow jams, which play during four of the film's five love scenes (an oral sex scene between Michelle and Mike uses only instrumental music). The songs are \"I Will\" by Jarah Gibson, \"Crazy\" by Clint Gamboa, \"Baby You and Me\" by Gamboa with Bell Johnson, and \"You're My Rose\" by Kitra Williams & Reflection. \"You're My Rose\" is also reprised during the end credits. The soundtrack was released by Wiseau's TPW Records on July 27, 2003. Gamboa later appeared as a semi-finalist on the 10th season of American Idol. | In a February 18, 2011 Entertainment Weekly article, veteran script supervisor Sandy Schklair announced that he now desires credit for directing The Room. Schklair told EW shortly after being hired on as script supervisor, Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly; Schklair claims that Wiseau then asked him to \"tell the actors what to do, and yell 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get.\" The script supervisor also claims to have had a conversation with Wiseau in which he refused to give up the title of \"director\", but asked Schklair to \"direct [his] movie.\" The story is corroborated by at least one of the film's actors, who requested anonymity for the story. Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's claims.[23] Greg Sestero's memoir The Disaster Artist about the making of The Room partially corroborates Schklair's version of events, describing him taking charge of numerous sequences in which Wiseau found himself unable to remember lines properly or adequately interact with the rest of the cast, but jokes that claiming directorial credit was like \"claiming to have been the Hindenburg's principal aeronautics engineer\".[8] Wiseau said of Schklair's assertion, \"Well, this is so laughable that… you know what? I don’t know, probably only in America it can happen, this kind of stuff.\"[16]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tommy Wiseau","m_produced_by":"Tommy Wiseau","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tommy Wiseau | Juliette Danielle | Greg Sestero | Philip Haldiman | Carolyn Minnott","m_music_by":"Mladen Milicevic","m_cinematography":"Todd Barron","m_edited_by":"Eric Chase","m_production_company":"Wiseau-Films","m_distributed_by":"Chloe Productions | TPW Films","m_release_dates":"June 27, 2003 (2003-06-27) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"99 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$6 million[2] | The Room is a 2003 American independent romantic drama film written, directed, produced by and starring Tommy Wiseau. The film is primarily centered on the melodramatic love triangle among amiable banker Johnny (Wiseau), his fiancée Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his conflicted best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and/or are unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. In an interview included as a special feature on the DVD of the film, Wiseau briefly explains the title as alluding to a room's potential to be the site of both good and bad events; in Sestero's book The Disaster Artist, Sestero recounts that Wiseau, when writing the stage-play script from which he adapted the film script, at first planned to set the entire play inside a single room. | Ross Morin, an assistant professor of film studies at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, USA, described The Room to Entertainment Weekly as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\".[3] A number of notable publications have labeled it as one of the worst films ever made.[4][5] Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters, The Room quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre storytelling and various technical and narrative flaws. Although Wiseau has retroactively characterized the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, a viewpoint supported by some of the film's cast.[6][7] | The film inspired a 2010 video game of the same name, a 2013 book titled The Disaster Artist, and an upcoming film based on The Disaster Artist, called The Masterpiece. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Foundas, Scott (July 17, 2003). \"Review: 'The Room'\".
