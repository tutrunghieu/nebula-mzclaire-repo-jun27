{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren documenting the Amityville murders at the Amityville house in 1976, to determine if a demonic presence was truly responsible for Ronald DeFeo Jr. mass murdering his family on November 13, 1974. During a seance, Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders and discovers a demonic nun figure, before seeing Ed being fatally impaled. After a struggle, Ed is able to break her out of the vision. | One year later, in 1977, the Hodgson family begins to discover strange occurrences within their home in London, England. Janet, the second oldest of four children, is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity who insists that the house is his. Eventually, all siblings of the house and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes, forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors. When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons, Janet is possessed by the spirit of Bill Wilkins, an older man who previously lived and died in the house, and who wants to claim his territory. As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession, the story eventually reaches the Warrens, who are requested to assist the local church in the investigation. Lorraine, in fear of her vision of Ed's death becoming reality, warns him not to get too involved in the case, and reluctantly agrees to travel to London. She has yet another vision of the demonic nun in the collection room wherein the demon says its name, which Lorraine scribbles in her Bible. | While staying at the Hodgson residence, Ed and Lorraine consult with other paranormal investigators, including Maurice Grosse and Anita Gregory, on the legitimacy of the case. They also attempt to communicate with Wilkins' spirit, hoping to talk him out of harassing the family. One night, after the Hodgsons witness Janet being possessed, Gregory presents video evidence of Janet purposely wrecking the kitchen as if for a prank. Ed and Lorraine are then convinced to leave the family on their own, but soon they discover that the spirit of Wilkins is only a pawn, being manipulated to haunt Janet, while the true mastermind is the demonic spirit that has been haunting Lorraine in her visions. | Ed and Lorraine return to the Hodgson residence, only to find Janet being possessed once more and the rest of the Hodgsons locked outside the house. A lightning strike hits a tree near the house, leaving a jagged stump resembling the object that impaled Ed in Lorraine's vision. Ed ventures inside the house alone, and finds Janet standing near the window, ready to leap onto the stump and commit suicide. He manages to grab Janet in time, but finds himself holding onto a curtain that is being torn from its rings by his and Janet's weight. Lorraine remembers that she wrote the demon's name – Valak – in her Bible. She enters the house and confronts Valak, addressing it by name and successfully condemning it back to Hell. Janet is freed of her possession, and Lorraine pulls her and Ed to safety. | A text epilogue reveals that Peggy lived the rest of her life in that house and died in 2003, sitting in the same chair in which Wilkins had died 40 years earlier. Upon returning home, Ed adds an item to his and Lorraine's collection – \"The Crooked Man\" zoetrope toy owned by Peggy's youngest child – placing it near April's music box and a doll. The couple then dance to \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" by Elvis Presley.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"As of July 3, 2016[update], The Conjuring 2 has grossed $95.3 million in North America and $178.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $274.1 million, against a budget of $40 million.[3] | In North America, the film opened on June 10, 2016, alongside Warcraft and Now You See Me 2, and was projected to gross $35–40 million from 3,343 theaters in its opening weekend.[2][48] The film grossed $3.4 million from its Thursday night previews, besting the $3.3 million made by its predecessor, and $16.4 million in its first day.[49][50] In its opening weekend, the film grossed $40.4 million from 3,434 theaters (almost matching its predecessor's $41.9 million opening),[51] making it the biggest opening for a horror film since the original film in 2013 and the biggest ever for the month of June.[52] Following a first place finish in its first weekend of release, the film faced a steep decline of 63.2% in its second weekend (earning $14.8 million from 3,356 theaters): a much larger drop than The Conjuring (46.9%) and Annabelle (57.3%). As a result, it slipped to third place behind newcomers Finding Dory and Central Intelligence.[53] It began to lose considerable amount of theaters by its third weekend as a result of numerous newly released films. Forbes magazine noted that The Conjuring 2 was falling faster than the previous film, but had already made more than Insidious: Chapter 2, Annabelle and both The Purge and The Purge: Anarchy had done at that point in their releases.[54] | Outside North America, the film was released across 44 countries the same weekend as its United States release, and grossed $51.5 million in its opening weekend from 10,400 screens, debuting in second place behind Warcraft.[55][56] It added another $43.1 million in its second weekend from a total of 57 countries as well as passing the $100 million threshold. However, it still remained in second place at the international box office, behind newcomer Finding Dory.[57] | It recorded the biggest opening day of all time for a horror film in 24 markets, including Mexico ($1.6 million), Brazil ($735,000), Australia ($401,000), and all of Latin America.[58] Moreover, in terms of opening weekend, the film scored the biggest opening for a horror film in 26 markets, including Mexico ($9 million), Brazil ($4.1 million), and Australia ($3 million).[56] In Argentina, the film scored the second biggest opening for Warner Bros. with $2.85 million, behind only Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[59] In South Korea, the film opened to $4 million,[56] Spain to $1.85 million, Russia to $1.75 million,[57] and Italy to $1.1 million.[60] The film faced stiff competition against Central Intelligence in Germany, making $2.1 million in its opening weekend, placing in second behind the aforementioned film.[57] In the United Kingdom, the film earned an opening weekend of £4.6 million ($6.8 million) from 504 theaters, over twice its predecessor's opening ($3.3 million).[61] In terms of total earnings, its biggest markets outside of North America are Mexico ($18.6 million), Korea ($11.5 million), and India ($11.5 million).[60] | Like its predecessor, The Conjuring 2 received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 79%, based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Conjuring 2 can't help but lose a bit of its predecessor's chilly sting through familiarity, but what remains is still a superior ghost story told with spine-tingling skill.\"[62] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[5] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an \"A–\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by its predecessor.[63] | In her review for The Hollywood Reporter, Sheri Linden praised the film, saying: \"Three years after The Conjuring rattled the multiplex with old-school horror, director James Wan ups the ante with an excellent sequel.\"[64] Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing: \"On one level, The Conjuring 2 is just a not-bad megaplex funhouse movie, no more and no less, but on another level it offers its potential fans a helping of reassurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghost demons out there, then God must be out there as well. Audiences, it was long ago proven, will pay to see both.\"[65] TheWrap's Alonso Duralde gave the film a positive review, stating: \"Frightening rarely strikes twice in the same place, despite the efforts of so many horror sequels, but even if The Conjuring 2 doesn't deliver the delightful jolts of its predecessor, it maintains a consistent chill throughout, with a slow and steady dread that creeps up on you over time.\"[66] | In a mixed review, Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-, writing: \"There are some solid scares (Wan is too gifted in the dark art of gotcha manipulation to not make you leap a few times), but there's nothing on par with the first film's brilliant hide-and-clap scene with Lili Taylor.\"[67] Jacob Wilkins of The Cavalier Daily lauded the film, calling Wan a \"master of horror\" and remarked that the film was \"fresh, original and unsettling.\"[68] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com wrote that he was \"pleasantly surprised\" by the sequel and what Wan has accomplished with the film, stating: \"Wan knows the tricks of this trade (heightened sound effects, moving furniture, dark corners) but somehow miraculously he really puts a fresh spin on it all here. It's riveting stuff, even if in a familiar cinematic environment.\" He added: \"It is one hell of a movie.\"[69]","m_production":"In July 2013, prior to The Conjuring's release, Variety reported that New Line Cinema was already in the early stages of development of a sequel, following the positive test screenings and reviews of the first film.[7] The film deals with the case of the Enfield Poltergeist, which took place in the London Borough of Enfield from 1977 to 1979, and involved the alleged haunting of two sisters, aged 11 and 13, at their mother's council house.[8] The Conjuring 2 also touches on the Warrens' most famous and most documented case, The Amityville Horror.[9] | I've been working very heavily on the script, and the idea of continuing the saga of Ed and Lorraine Warren is actually very exciting. So the idea of going back to kind of nurture my baby that I created is part of the reason why I'm going back to do The Conjuring 2. | In July 2013, it was reported that Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson had signed on to reprise their roles from The Conjuring.[11] This was confirmed in February 2014.[12] On October 21, 2014, it was announced that James Wan would return to direct the sequel, and production would begin in the summer of 2015.[13] In early July 2015, lead actors Farmiga and Wilson visited Lorraine Warren at the New England Paranormal Research Center in Connecticut in preparation for their roles.[14] On July 28, 2015, Wan officially began pre-production for the film.[15] In August 2015, the film was granted $5.6 million in tax credits from the California Film Commission for bringing the production to the state.[16] | On September 13, 2015, Don Burgess was confirmed as the film's director of photography.[17] In September 2015, Frances O'Connor, Simon McBurney, newcomer Lauren Esposito, and Madison Wolfe joined the cast.[18][19][20][21] Franka Potente, Simon Delaney, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and newcomers Patrick McAuley and Benjamin Haigh were also reported to have been cast in late September 2015.[22] In November 2015, it was announced that Abhi Sinha had joined the cast of the film.[23] On December 1, 2015, it was confirmed that Sterling Jerins would reprise her role as the Warrens' daughter Judy.[24] | Principal photography for The Conjuring 2 began on September 21, 2015, in Los Angeles, California.[25] Due to an inexplicable series of events during production of the first film, a priest from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe was brought in to bless the set of the sequel by the film's producers.[26][27] Production moved to London on November 18, 2015, with filming taking place in and around The Warrington, a pub in the residential district of Maida Vale. On November 22, filming took place at Marylebone station.[28] Filming concluded on December 1, 2015.[29][30] Production lasted for 50 days, with 40 days filming on sets and locations in Los Angeles, and 10 days on location in London.[31]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Wan","m_produced_by":"Peter Safran | Rob Cowan | James Wan","m_screenplay_by":"James Wan | Chad Hayes | Carey Hayes | David Leslie Johnson","m_story_by":"James Wan | Chad Hayes | Carey Hayes","m_starring":"Vera Farmiga | Patrick Wilson | Frances O'Connor | Madison Wolfe | Simon McBurney | Franka Potente","m_music_by":"Joseph Bishara","m_cinematography":"Don Burgess","m_edited_by":"Kirk M.
