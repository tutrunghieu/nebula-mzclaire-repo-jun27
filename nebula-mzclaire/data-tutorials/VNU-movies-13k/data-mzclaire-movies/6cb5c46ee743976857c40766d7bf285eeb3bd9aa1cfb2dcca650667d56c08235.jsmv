She steals the ring and escapes back to the United States after killing another man. Pretending to be her own 'niece' Terry Hart, she proceeds to keep herself young by killing men for their pineal extract. | She quickly becomes enamored with her lawyer Neil Foster (Grant Williams), a man half her actual age, and kills his jealous fiancee Sally (Gloria Talbott), both to maintain her youthful appearance and to eliminate the competition. | When the cops come to investigate the murders, June uses Sally's pineal gland when alone but finds it does not work due to it being female, and before the cops find her, she throws herself out a window and dies, and when they view her body it is in more of a shriveled state than ever.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Universal produced this low budget film because they needed a second feature to play as a double feature with the U.S release The Brides of Dracula.[1] Stars Coleen Gray and Phillip Terry were so into their performances as a feuding couple that they didn't even get along off-camera either.[2] | The film's working title was \"The Leech\".[3] According to contemporary reviews, the filmmakers mixed stock footage of African wildlife and tribal dances with scenes shot in the studio.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Edward Dein","m_produced_by":"John Greshenson","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Grant Williams Coleen Gray Phillip Terry Gloria Talbott John van Dreelen Estelle Hemsley Kim Hamilton Arthur Batanides","m_music_by":"Irving Gertz Uncredited: Hans J.
