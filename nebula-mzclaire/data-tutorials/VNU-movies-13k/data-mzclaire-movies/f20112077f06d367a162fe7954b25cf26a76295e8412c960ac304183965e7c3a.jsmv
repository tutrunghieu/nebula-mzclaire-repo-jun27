Zhang Zhichen (Xin Baiqing), a city doctor, comes to visit his old friend from school Dai Liyan (Wu Jun) shortly after the war against the Japanese has ended. Dai is sickly although Zhang suspects it to be mainly a case of hypochondria. While visiting, he meets Liyan's wife, Yuwen (Hu Jingfan) and Liyan's young teenage sister Dai Xiu (Lu Sisi). | Zhang and Yuwen has had a passionate love affair ten years earlier before she had been engaged to marry her husband. Due to her husband's sickness however, the couple has ceased any real physical contact. With Zhang back, both Yuwen and the doctor find themselves again attracted to one another. | As emotions run high, Dai Xiu's birthday comes up. As the drinks begin to flow, Zhang and Yuwen's mutual attraction emerge clearly to everyone, especially to Liyan. Too sickly in his mind to care for his wife any longer, he begs Zhang to stay. Liyan then promptly attempts suicide by overdose but is saved by his friend. Zhang then decides that it is best that he departs. | While faithful to the plot of the original, Tian's remake did choose to drop the original's use of a voice-over narration by Yuwen.","m_cast":"Unlike Tian's ensemble direction in The Blue Kite, the cast here is deliberately limited to only five actors, all of whom were unknowns at the time of Springtime's release.[1] | Hu Jingfan as Yuwen, the wife | Wu Jun as Dai Liyan, her husband | Xin Baiqing as Zhang Zhichen, Dai Liyan's childhood friend and Yuwen's former lover | Ye Xiaokeng as Lao Huang, Dai Liyan and Yuwen's loyal servant | Lu Sisi as Dai Xiu, Dai Liyan's young sister","m_reception":"The film received positive reviews from film critics.

It was funded by several production companies from China (Beijing Film Studio, Beijing Rosart Film), France (Orly Films, Paradis Films), and the Netherlands (Fortissimo Films). | Unlike Kite, which deployed a large cast, spanned decades, and carried a political message, Springtime is a small intimate chamber-piece.[1] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Kemp, Philip (July 2003). \"Springtime in a Small Town\".
