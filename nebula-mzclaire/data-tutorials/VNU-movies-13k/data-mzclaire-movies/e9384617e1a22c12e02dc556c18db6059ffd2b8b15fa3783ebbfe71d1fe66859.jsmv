{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Harry Collings (Fonda) and Arch Harris (Oates) are two saddle tramps who have grown weary after seven years of wandering through the American Southwest. Along with a younger companion, Dan Griffen (Robert Pratt), they stop off in Del Norte, a ramshackle town in the middle of nowhere, which is run by the corrupt McVey (Severn Darden). Harris and Griffen discuss traveling to California to look for work when Collings abruptly informs them he has decided to return to the wife he left years before. Griffen temporarily leaves the two in a bar and goes to buy supplies. Some town thugs shoot him to death out of pure meanness. Collings and Harris escape, but they return that night. Collings shoots McVey in the feet, crippling him. | After riding hundreds of miles back to his old house, Collings finds a cold welcome from his wife Hannah (Bloom). In order to be allowed to stay, he offers his services simply as a “hired hand”. Hannah agrees and quickly puts him to work. Gradually, the distrust and unease caused by years of estrangement slip away, and the two begin to become close again. For the first time, Collings feels willing to settle down, but Harris leaves, wanting 'to see the ocean'. | McVey and his troupe of hooligans interrupt his life. Learning that they have kidnapped Harris, Collings leaves Hannah again, this time to save his friend. In a subsequent brutal shootout with McVey's gang, all of the villains are killed and Collings is fatally wounded. Harris rides alone to Hannah's house.","m_cast":"Peter Fonda as Harry Collings | Warren Oates as Arch Harris | Verna Bloom as Hannah Collings | Robert Pratt as Dan Griffen | Severn Darden as McVey | Rita Rogers as Mexican Woman | Ann Doran as Mrs. Sorenson | Ted Markland as Luke | Owen Orr as Mace | Al Hopson as Bartender | Megan Denver as Janey Collings | Michael McClure as Plummer | Gray Johnson as Will | Larry Hagman as Sheriff (television version only)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Due to the huge financial success of Easy Rider (1969), which Fonda co-wrote, produced and starred in, Universal Studios gave him full artistic control over The Hired Hand, his debut as a director. (Universal also did the same for Dennis Hopper with The Last Movie that year.) Hand was shot in New Mexico in the summer of 1970 with a budget of slightly less than $1,000,000. As he later discussed, Fonda was supported as a neophyte filmmaker by the cast of polished character actors, headed by Warren Oates. In addition, cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond provided a high quality of naturalistic imagery. Zsigmond credited this film as his first major assignment in feature film: \"... Before that [The Hired Hand] I basically did commercials. The Hired Hand was probably the first time that I [as a cinematographer] actually had a dramatic story with good actors....\" Fonda’s selection of the then-unknown Bruce Langhorne as the film’s musical composer was rewarded, as nearly all the film’s reviews singled out the score as being unusually expressive and beautiful. | Frank Mazzola edited the film, using a series of complex and poetic montages, which featured elaborate dissolves, slow motion and overlapping still photography. Mazzola’s opening montage was praised by several critics as the film’s most memorable sequence.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Peter Fonda","m_produced_by":"William Hayward Stanley A.
