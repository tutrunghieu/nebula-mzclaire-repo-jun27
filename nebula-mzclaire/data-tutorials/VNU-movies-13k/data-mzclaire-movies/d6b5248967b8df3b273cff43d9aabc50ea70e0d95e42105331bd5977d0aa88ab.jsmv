Robinson claimed he didn't like Habib's style of direction. | He was a mad home movies crank and would stand by the camera or even ten feet away from it and be shooting the scene that was his first take. I used to wonder how the hell does he know what is going on there. Often he was on an entirely different angle to the camera. He often seemed more concerned about getting a good scene on his little 16 mm camera. Right from the beginning I found I was in a marvellous position as the second follow-up director because I could see everything that was being done and then rack my brains for some little thing that might spice the scene up a bit.[5] | Noted Sydney theatre actor Doris Fitton had a supporting role.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"novel Le Passager Clandestin by Georges Simenon","m_directed_by":"Lee Robinson Ralph Habib","m_produced_by":"Robert Dorfmann Lee Robinson Paul-Edmond Decharme","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Martine Carol Roger Livesey Arletty","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Desmond Dickinson","m_edited_by":"Stanley Moore Monique Kirsanoff","m_production_company":"Southern International Productions(Australia) Discifilm/Silverfilm (France)","m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"22 March 1958 (France) December 1958 (Australia)","m_running_time":"93 minutes","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English French","m_budget":"₤250,000[1]","m_box_office":"1,776,374 admissions (France)[2] | The Stowaway is a 1958 French-Australian film directed by Australian director Lee Robinson and French Lebanese director Ralph Habib.
