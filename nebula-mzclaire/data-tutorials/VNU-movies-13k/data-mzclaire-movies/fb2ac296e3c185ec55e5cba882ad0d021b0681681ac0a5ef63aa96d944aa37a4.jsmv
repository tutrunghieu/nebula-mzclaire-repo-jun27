{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In a Mexican town along the U.S.-Mexico border, a time bomb is planted in a car. Rudy Linnekar (Jeffrey Green) and woman Zita enter the vehicle and make a slow journey through town to the U.S. border, the woman (Joi Lansing) insisting that she hears something ticking. Newlyweds Miguel \"Mike\" Vargas (Charlton Heston), a drug enforcement official in the Mexican government, and his wife Susie (Janet Leigh) pass the car several times on foot. The car crosses the border, then explodes, killing the occupants. (The cut to the exploding car is the first one in the film, the single-camera opening sequence lasting nearly three and one-half minutes.) | Realizing the implications of a Mexican bomb exploding on American soil, Vargas takes an interest in the investigation. Police Chief Pete Gould (Harry Shannon) and District Attorney Adair (Ray Collins) arrive on the scene, followed by the game-legged police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and Quinlan's longtime partner, Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia)—who clearly worships Quinlan. The obese and dishevelled Captain nostalgically visits a brothel run by Tanya (Marlene Dietrich), who barely recognizes him. | Quinlan's and Menzies' prime suspect is Sanchez, a young Mexican secretly married to the victim's daughter (Joanna Moore). They interrogate Sanchez in his apartment with Vargas present. Vargas visits the bathroom and accidentally knocks over an empty shoebox. Moments later, Menzies enters the bathroom and announces that two sticks of dynamite were found in the same shoebox. Vargas accuses Quinlan of planting the evidence and begins to suspect that he may have been doing so for years, to help win convictions. Quinlan dismisses the Vargas claim, saying he is just biased in favor of fellow Mexicans. The stress of these accusations, along with pressure from \"Uncle\" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), the brother of a man Vargas has been investigating, to strike a deal to discredit Vargas, causes Quinlan—who has been sober for 12 years—to fall off the wagon. With assistance from District Attorney's Assistant Al Schwartz (Mort Mills), Vargas studies the public records on Quinlan's previous cases, revealing his findings to Gould and Adair. Quinlan arrives in time to overhear the discussion and angrily threatens to resign. | Susie Vargas is moved from her Mexican hotel to a remote American motel to escape the unwanted attention of Grandi . The motel, which Menzies recommended to her, has no other guests and is staffed only by a very peculiar night manager (Dennis Weaver), and, unknown to Susie, is owned by Grandi himself. Grandi's family members take over the motel and terrorize Susie. Vargas becomes concerned when his attempts to telephone Susie at the motel are blocked. Quinlan conspires with Grandi, arranging for Susie to be raped, kidnapped, injected with drugs, and taken to Grandi’s hotel in town. Quinlan then double-crosses Grandi, strangles him, and leaves Susie, still drugged and unconscious, in the room with Grandi's body, all in order to discredit Vargas. However, exhausted, drunk, and shaken from killing Grandi, Quinlan carelessly leaves his cane at the scene of the murder, implicating himself. When Susie wakes up, she sees Grandi's body, screams for help, and is arrested on suspicion of murder. | Vargas confronts Menzies about the history of evidence \"discovered\" by Quinlan. When he goes to Susie's motel, but can't find her, Vargas learns the motel is owned by Grandi, and that his handgun has been stolen. He rushes back to town and enters a bar, where he confronts the gang members who attacked his wife. When they refuse to answer his questions, Vargas violently beats them down, destroying the bar in the process. Schwarz then informs a shocked Vargas that Susie has been arrested for murder. At the lockup, Vargas finds her barely conscious. Menzies reveals to Vargas that he discovered Quinlan's cane at the murder scene. Vargas fits Menzies with a wire. Near an oil field, Menzies meets Quinlan, while being tracked on foot by Vargas, who is recording the conversation. | Quinlan admits to Menzies that he planted evidence on people, but insists that he did so only because he knew they were guilty. Quinlan hears an echo from the secret microphone and says his \"game leg\" has informed him of Menzies' betrayal. Quinlan demands that Vargas show himself. Quinlan then shoots Menzies with Vargas's gun, which he had earlier stolen from Vargas's briefcase. Quinlan prepares to shoot Vargas (saying that he can claim Vargas was resisting arrest) but is, instead, shot in the final act of the dying Menzies. Quinlan staggers backwards into a filthy pool of wastewater and dies. Schwartz arrives at the scene and tells Vargas that the planted dynamite was unnecessary because Sanchez confessed to the crime. Schwartz asks Tanya, as she walks away, what she has to say about Quinlan. Tanya replies, \"He was some kind of a man. What does it matter what you say about people?\"","m_cast":"Charlton Heston as Ramon Miguel Vargas | Janet Leigh as Susan Vargas | Orson Welles as Police Captain Hank Quinlan | Joseph Calleia as Pete Menzies | Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Joe Grandi | Joanna Cook Moore as Marcia Linnekar | Ray Collins as District Attorney Adair | Dennis Weaver as the Night Manager | Val de Vargas as Pancho | Mort Mills as Al Schwartz | Victor Millan as Manolo Sanchez | Lalo Rios as Risto | Phil Harvey as Blaine | Joi Lansing as Blonde | Harry Shannon as Police Chief Pete Gould | Rusty Wescoatt as Casey | Wayne Taylor as a gang member | Ken Miller as a gang member | Raymond Rodriguez as a gang member | Arlene McQuade as Ginnie | Dan White as the Border Guard | Zsa Zsa Gabor as the Strip-club owner | Marlene Dietrich as Tanya | Mercedes McCambridge as a hoodlum | William Tannen as Howard Frantz | Joseph Cotten as a Detective","m_reception":null,"m_production":"There are two stories as to how Welles ended up directing Touch of Evil. Charlton Heston recalled that Welles was originally hired to act in the film only, not to direct or write. Universal was keen to secure Heston for the lead, but he wanted the studio to confirm the director before he signed on. After learning that Welles was in the cast, Heston expressed his greater interest in starring if Welles were directing. | The other story is that Welles had recently worked with producer Albert Zugsmith, known as the \"King of the Bs\", on a film called Man in the Shadow and was interested in directing something for him. Zugsmith offered him a pile of scripts, of which Welles asked for the worst to prove he could make a great film out of a bad script. At the time, the script was called Badge of Evil, after a Whit Masterson novel on which it was based. Welles did a rewrite and took it into production. After a decade in Europe during which he completed only a few films, Welles was eager to direct for Hollywood again, so he agreed to take only an acting fee for the role of Quinlan.[7][8] | A number of notable actors pop up in roles. Dennis Weaver plays a night clerk at a motel, in a truly over-the-top performance. Heston liked Weaver and his film acting work. Zsa Zsa Gabor, who appears briefly as the impresario of a strip club, was a friend of the producer. Joseph Calleia portrays Quinlan's betrayed partner. Many of the actors worked for lower wages just to make a film with Welles. Marlene Dietrich's role was a surprise to the producers and they raised her fee so they could advertise her involvement. Welles' friend and Mercury Theatre colleague Joseph Cotten appears uncredited as a police officer. | Janet Leigh recalled how Welles asked for input from the actors in the cast: | It started with rehearsals. We rehearsed two weeks prior to shooting, which was unusual. We rewrote most of the dialogue, all of us, which was also unusual, and Mr. Welles always wanted our input. It was a collective effort, and there was such a surge of participation, of creativity, of energy. You could feel the pulse growing as we rehearsed. You felt you were inventing something as you went along. Mr. Welles wanted to seize every moment. He didn't want one bland moment. He made you feel you were involved in a wonderful event that was happening before your eyes.[9] | Welles wrapped production on time, delivered a rough cut to Universal, and was convinced that his Hollywood career was back on the rails. However, the film was then re-edited (and in part re-shot) by Universal International pictures. The editing process was protracted and disputed, and the version eventually released was not the film Universal or Welles had hoped for. It was released as a B-movie, the lower half of a double feature. The A-movie was The Female Animal, starring Hedy Lamarr, produced by Albert Zugsmith and directed by Harry Keller, whom the studio had hired to direct the re-shot material in Touch of Evil. The two films even had the same cameraman, Russell Metty. Welles' film was given little publicity despite the many stars in the cast. Though it had little commercial success in the US (Welles himself claimed that the movie turned a good profit but other records disputed his claim), it was well received in Europe, particularly by critics like future filmmaker François Truffaut. | The film opens with a three-minute, twenty-second tracking shot widely considered by critics as one of the greatest long takes in cinema history.[10][11]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Badge of Evil 1956 novel  by Whit Masterson","m_directed_by":"Orson Welles","m_produced_by":"Albert Zugsmith","m_screenplay_by":"Orson Welles","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Charlton Heston | Janet Leigh | Orson Welles | Joseph Calleia | Akim Tamiroff | Marlene Dietrich | Zsa Zsa Gabor","m_music_by":"Henry Mancini","m_cinematography":"Russell Metty","m_edited_by":"Virgil Vogel | Aaron Stell","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal-International","m_release_dates":"May 21, 1958 (1958-05-21) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"95 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$829,000","m_box_office":"$2,237,659[1][2] 1,232,534 admissions (France)[3] | Touch of Evil is a 1958 American film noir crime thriller film, written, directed by, and co-starring Orson Welles. The screenplay was loosely based on the novel Badge of Evil by Whit Masterson. Along with Welles, the cast includes Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff, and Marlene Dietrich. | Touch of Evil is one of the last examples of film noir in the genre's classic era (from the early 1940s until the late 1950s).[4] Since its release, the film's reputation has grown in stature, and it is now widely regarded as one of Welles' best films, and also one of the best classic era film noirs. | In 1993 Touch of Evil was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[5][6] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Box Office Information for Touch of Evil.
