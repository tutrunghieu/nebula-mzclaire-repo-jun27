His troubles start when he discovers that he and his best friend Toshio are in love with the same girl, Ritsuko. Then he crosses paths with Takeshi Hamada (Kazuki Kitamura) a student at a rival high school and an excellent fighter in his own right, who is the leader of the gang of assaulters. Kazuyoshi is determined to challenge Takeshi one on one, but because of a series of unforeseen circumstances, his ambition for a final battle is constantly and comically thwarted. Years later they have each achieved a certain level of success - Tamai as a boxer champion and Takeshi as a popular professional wrestler. The two finally get around to settling their old dispute in the Tokyo Dome.","m_cast":"Kyôsuke Yabe as Kazuyoshi Tamai | Kazuki Kitamura as Takeshi Hamada | Ryoko Imamura as Ritsuko | Rynosuke Sakai as Karate Kurata | Takashi Miike as stabbing victim | Takeshi Caesar | Tomohiko Okuda | Jirô Watanabe","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Takashi Miike","m_produced_by":"Kazuo Suzaki","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Hideo Yamamoto","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"September 27, 1996 (1996-09-27) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"114 minutes","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"Japanese | The Way to Fight (喧嘩の花道 大阪最強伝説, Kenka no hanamichi: Ōsaka saikyō densetsu?) is a 1996 Japanese film directed by Takashi Miike.","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Way To Fight at the Internet Movie Database | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/TheWayToFightDVDCover.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Story: Seijun Ninomiya Screenplay: Masa Nakamura"}
