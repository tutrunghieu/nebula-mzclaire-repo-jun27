Melanie, the youngest, is all but grown, still living with Aurora at home but giving serious thought to moving out. Aurora's only true companion is housekeeper Rosie, particularly now that a man she's been spending time with, the General, is a friend, not a romance. | Her late daughter's old friend Patsy still has a home in Houston and thinks of herself as Aurora's friend now, dispensing advice to Melanie, something that Aurora doesn't appreciate. | Rosie is being courted by an elderly gentleman named Arthur, who has bought astronaut Garrett Breedlove's former house next door. On seeing how lonely Aurora obviously is, Rosie tricks her into seeing a licensed counselor, Jerry, to whom Aurora admits that she's still seeking \"the love of my life.\" | Thoroughly unprofessional in almost every way, Jerry jumps into a romantic situation with Aurora himself. But he has an ulterior motive, which she soon learns. Aurora is cheered up only by a brief visit from Garrett, who advises her to find that true love soon because \"there aren't that many shopping days left till Christmas.\" | Needing a cause, Aurora decides to take charge after Melanie moves to California to try to become an actress. She is peeved to discover that Patsy has exactly the same idea. Melanie succeeds in landing a role on a television show.

She is left once more facing the prospect of being alone.","m_cast":"Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway | Bill Paxton as Jerry Bruckner | Juliette Lewis as Melanie Horton | Miranda Richardson as Patsy Carpenter | Ben Johnson as Arthur Cotton | Scott Wolf as Bruce | George Newbern as Tommy Horton | Marion Ross as Rosie Dunlop | Mackenzie Astin as Teddy Horton | Donald Moffat as Hector Scott | Jack Nicholson as Garrett Breedlove | China Kantner as Jane | Jake Langerud as Henry","m_reception":"Unlike Terms of Endearment, the film was not a box-office success, grossing only $12,767,815 (unadjusted) and received poor reviews from critics, as it currently holds a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[citation needed] | Roger Ebert, in his Chicago Sun-Times review of Dec. 27, 1996, described The Evening Star as \"a completely unconvincing sequel,\" awarding it only one-and-a-half stars of a possible four.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Harling","m_produced_by":"David Kirkpatrick Polly Platt","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Shirley MacLaine Bill Paxton Juliette Lewis Miranda Richardson","m_music_by":"William Ross","m_cinematography":"Don Burgess","m_edited_by":"David Moritz","m_production_company":"Rysher Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 25, 1996 (1996-12-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"129 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$20 million","m_box_office":"$12,767,815 | The Evening Star is a 1996 sequel to Academy Award for Best Picture-winning Terms of Endearment, starring Shirley MacLaine, who reprises the role of Aurora Greenway she won an Oscar for playing in the original film.
