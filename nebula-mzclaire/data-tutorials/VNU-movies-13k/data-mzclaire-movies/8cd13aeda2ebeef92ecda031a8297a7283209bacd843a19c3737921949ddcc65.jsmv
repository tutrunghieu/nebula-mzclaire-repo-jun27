{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Olivier, a carpenter by trade who teaches at a trades training center, knowingly takes on Francis Thorion, the murderer of his son, as an apprentice. Francis is unaware of his connection with Olivier from five years ago. Olivier, tormented by the loss of his son and his separation from his wife, develops a slight obsession with Francis. He stalks him home, steals his keys and explores his apartment, whilst slowly discovering more about the boy. Francis looks up to Olivier, seeing him as a surrogate role-model. With this on his mind, Olivier is ultimately torn between hatred for the murderer of his son and the moral ambiguity of accepting this child from a broken home and disillusioned past.","m_cast":"Olivier Gourmet as Olivier | Morgan Marinne as Francis Thorion | Isabella Soupart as Magali | Nassim Hassaïni as Omar | Kevin Leroy as Raoul | Félicien Pitsaer as Steve | Rémy Renaud as Philippo | Annette Closset as Training center director | Fabian Marnette as Rino | Jimmy Deloof as Dany | Anne Gerard as Dany's mother","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne Luc Dardenne","m_produced_by":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne Luc Dardenne Denis Freyd","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Olivier Gourmet Morgan Marinne Isabella Soupart","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Alain Marcoen","m_edited_by":"Marie-Hélène Dozo","m_production_company":"Archipel 35 Les Films du Fleuve RTBF","m_distributed_by":"Diaphana Films (France)","m_release_dates":"9 October 2002 (2002-10-09) (Belgium) | 23 October 2002 (2002-10-23) (France) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes[1]","m_country":"Belgium France","m_language":"French","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$70,262[2] | The Son (French: Le Fils) is a 2002 Belgian-French mystery film directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"LES FILS - THE SON (12A)\".
