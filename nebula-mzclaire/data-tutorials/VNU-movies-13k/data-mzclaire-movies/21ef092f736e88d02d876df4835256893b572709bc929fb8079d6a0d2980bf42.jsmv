Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by a man sent to assassinate Richard. The plane crashes, killing both Richard and Mary, after he uploads the video. | In the present, Richard's son Peter continues to fight crime as Spider-Man. He pursues and apprehends Aleksei Sytsevich. Later, Peter meets with Gwen at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborn, returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, Norman, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO. | While working in an OsCorp laboratory, electrical engineer Max Dillon shocks himself by accident and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered electric eels. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England for schooling. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into Times Square, accidentally causing a blackout, and is stopped by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist Dr. Kafka. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the Daily Bugle, to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry develops an intense hatred towards Spider-Man. The OsCorp board-members, in particular the vice-president, Donald Menken, frame Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, and remove him as CEO. Harry's assistant, Felicia Hardy, informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself \"Electro,\" to get him back inside the OsCorp building. There he finds a suit of armour and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harry's illness and transforms him into a goblin-like creature, but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health and cures his disease. | Peter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's biogenetic weaponization plans. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him she was offered the British scholarship and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He manages to catch her and professes his love for her, and, vowing to go wherever she goes, they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to fight him as Spider-Man. Gwen follows, and together they restore power and overload Electro's body, killing him. Afterward, the transformed Harry, who now calls himself \"Green Goblin,\" arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry; upon seeing Gwen, Green Goblin deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her. He fights Spider-Man at the top of a clock tower but is knocked unconscious and defeated. Despite Spider-Man's attempts to save Gwen, she falls to her death after webbing breaks in the clock tower. Distraught, Peter ends his career as Spider-Man. | Five months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, Gustav Fiers, visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own team in order carry out their own ends. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich, and Fiers breaks Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with electromechanical suit armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets.

Garfield explained that the suit that he would wear in the film would undergo a new design. Garfield hoped to bring back the theme of him being an orphan stating, \"I wanna keep exploring that theme of being fatherless, being motherless, searching for purpose and finding a purpose within himself\".

He's the muscle, she's the brains.\"[12] | Jamie Foxx as Electro / Max Dillon: An electrical engineer who works for Oscorp Industries and later transforms into a powerful, electronical creature following an accident, then taking the alias of \"Electro\". Foxx described the character as \"a nobody\" who initially idolizes Spider-Man.[13] He develops an obsession with Spider-Man after being saved by him and obtains his powers through an accident at Oscorp involving electric eels. Foxx revealed that the character would be redesigned to be more grounded, and that the villain's classic yellow and green suit would be omitted in favor of a modern look like black as depicted in the film.[14] | Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn / Green Goblin: Peter's longtime friend for 10 years and son of Norman Osborn. He was sent away to boarding school around the same time Peter's parents disappeared, and meets him for the first time.[15] He eventually assumes the role of the Green Goblin after injecting a special serum of spider-venom into his body, initially injected to provide a cure, which instead turns him into a hideous, psychotic, goblin-like creature.

That said you can't help [but] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that ...\".[123] Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: \"A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending.\"[124] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor.\"[125] Guy Lodge of Variety said, \"Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry.\"[126] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that \"It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise.\"[127] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: \"Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't?

The web shooters were also modified.[29] | Actor J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy should the studio offer it to him.[30] In October 2012, Electro was rumored as the next villain.[31] Jamie Foxx was given the role.[32][33][34] That December, Foxx confirmed that he was cast as the character, and during an interview with MTV, explained that the redesign of the character would be more grounded as well as details of his depiction.[35] On December 3, 2012, Marc Webb revealed that Dane DeHaan was chosen to play Harry Osborn.[36] Paul Giamatti was confirmed as a cast member in February 2013.[37] Felicity Jones confirmed her involvement with the film under an undisclosed role.[38] Giamatti also indicated in an October 2013 interview that he would return in The Amazing Spider-Man 3 as well.[39] On February 27, 2013, Chris Cooper was cast as Norman Osborn.[40] | By October 10, 2012, Shailene Woodley was in talks for the role of Mary Jane Watson.[41][42] By March 14, 2013, Woodley had concluded filming her small role.[43] Garfield recalled, \"I think all of [those scenes] were in our backyards. We had two or three scenes with me talking over the fence, and there was one with us riding together on a motorcycle that we never got to shoot.\"[44] By mid-June, Mary Jane was cut from the film, with director Webb explaining it as \"a creative decision to streamline the story and focus on Peter and Gwen and their relationship.\"[45][46] | “This project had the highest level of detail incorporated into digital environments that we’d ever done. The human characters were finished to a very high degree. We had to do a very realistic version of Emma Stone. Spider-Man and Gwen are involved in stunts that would have been very dangerous if real.” | On February 4, 2013, Marc Webb posted on Twitter that principal photography had begun and that the sequel was being shot on 35 mm film in the anamorphic format,[48][49] instead of being filmed digitally as the preceding film was. Sony revealed this would be the first Spider-Man film to be filmed entirely in New York State, including a car-chase scene that was filmed in Rochester because the speed laws are less restrictive in upstate New York.[50] It became the largest film production ever in New York State.[51] The decision to film in Williamsburg, Brooklyn near the Passover holiday caused some controversy, as critics believed that this was culturally insensitive, and would cause problems with parking.[52] The filming company decided to work with the community and then agreed to adjust its production activities for Passover.[53][54] The producers had assembled a 200-person crew for the 10 day shoot in Rochester, with a total number of 250 local crew members and 150 local extras.[55] The prominent scenes were shot mostly on Main Street of Rochester and were digitally remastered to look like New York City.[56] | On June 25, Webb posted on Twitter that filming was completed.[57] Soundstage work was done at Grumman Studios and Gold Coast Studios, both in Bethpage, New York, and at the Marcy Armory in Brooklyn.[50][58] | Sony Pictures Imageworks designed the special effects for the film.[60] The digital composition of the film, including the scene where the battle of Spider-Man and Electro in Times Square, took one year to complete.[59] The sets of Times Square were built in Gold Coast Studios with the green screens[61] and most of the scenes were digitally re-designed by computer.[62] The photography and VFX team took over 36,000 photos of the Times Square in order to re-create the location digitally. In addition, the animation team captured over 100 billboards during the photography process.[63] | The film was post-converted from 2D to 3D, in part because the production team wanted to shoot 35 mm film. Dan Mindel used Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 and 200T 5213, while the second unit shot day exteriors on Kodak Vision3 50D 5203.[65] During the production, 20 layers of lightning CGI effects were applied to depict Electro. Jamie Foxx was photographed as Electro by KNB EFX team and the skin colors used to show the moods of the character.[66] A total number of 1600, visual effects shots of the film was originally filmed in 2K resolution and then converted into 4K resolution with the help of color grading.[67] To give the visual effects a realistic look, sound designers Addison Teague and Eric Norris and re-recording mixers Paul Massey and David Giammarco mixed the background music using Auro 11.1 cinema sound technology and the film's soundtrack was remixed using Dolby Atmos, Auro and Dolby 5.1.[67] | The film was mixed in Auro 11.1 and Dolby Atmos in the converted William Holden Theater. The mix for both was completed by Paul Massey and David Giammarco.[67][68] | A mid-credit teaser scene from X-Men: Days of Future Past was added to the film after its London premiere, due to an existing deal between Webb and 20th Century Fox, in which Fox allowed Webb to direct the film if Sony would promote the X-Men film for free.[69] The scene, set during the Vietnam War, shows Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), a rogue mutant, trying to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker (Josh Helman) in an attempt to recruit fellow mutants Havok (Lucas Till) and Toad (Evan Jonigkeit).[70][71][72] The scene's inclusion sparked confusion among some viewers in the United Kingdom, who thought it meant an X-Men–Spider-Man crossover film was being planned, based on how Marvel Studios and Disney use codas within the Marvel Cinematic Universe to promote future films.[69] |  | On July 20, 2013, Webb announced that Hans Zimmer would be composing the music for the film, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film.[73] On October 25, 2013, Pharrell Williams revealed to Billboard that he would co-compose the score with Zimmer.[74] Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and former Eurythmic, David A. Stewart to create the music for the sequel.[75] Eventually, Stewart did not participate in the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (a reference to the Sinister Six) was composed of Williams, Marr, Einziger, Junkie XL, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski assisting Zimmer. The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records.[76] Hans Zimmer described his work for this film asdifferent from previous works by him, thus revealing one of the themes for the film, which was first heard on the website.[77] | On March 31, 2014, a track called \"It's On Again\" was uploaded to Soundcloud.[78] It features vocals by Kendrick Lamar and Alicia Keys. Keys announced the song on Twitter and credited Zimmer and Williams, along with Lamar and herself for the song, indicating the song as a part of the film's soundtrack.[79] Webb described the song as “upbeat and exciting”.[79]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Amazing Spider-Man  by Stan Lee Steve Ditko","m_directed_by":"Marc Webb","m_produced_by":"Avi Arad | Matt Tolmach","m_screenplay_by":"Alex Kurtzman | Roberto Orci | Jeff Pinkner","m_story_by":"Alex Kurtzman | Roberto Orci | Jeff Pinkner | James Vanderbilt","m_starring":"Andrew Garfield | Emma Stone | Jamie Foxx | Dane DeHaan | Campbell Scott | Embeth Davidtz | Colm Feore | Paul Giamatti | Sally Field","m_music_by":"Hans Zimmer | The Magnificent Six | Pharrell Williams | Johnny Marr","m_cinematography":"Dan Mindel","m_edited_by":"Pietro Scalia","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"March 31, 2014 (2014-03-31) (Tokyo premiere)[2] | May 2, 2014 (2014-05-02) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"142 minutes[3]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$200-293 million[4][5]","m_box_office":"$709 million[6][7] | The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (also released as The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro in some markets)[8] is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb and released by Columbia Pictures.

The film subsequently won awards for its music composition and acting, notably one Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award and two ASCAP Awards. | The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was originally envisioned as the beginning of a shared fictional universe, which would have continued with two sequels and several spin-off films. Due to it performing below expectations, all subsequent installments were cancelled and a new iteration of the character, portrayed by Tom Holland appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, before he is scheduled to appear in his own film Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017. |  | ","m_marketing":"The release of the film in the United Kingdom was postponed to April 16, 2014, two days ahead of its original April 18 date.[80] Deadline reported that, in addition to the production budget, the film's marketing budget was $180–190 million.[81] | On July 17, 2013, Sony released a clip from the film with the first released footage of Jamie Foxx as Electro to encourage attendance at the panel, at the San Diego Comic-Con International.[82] At the panel they premiered a four-minute trailer, which was not publicly released but eventually leaked on the internet.
