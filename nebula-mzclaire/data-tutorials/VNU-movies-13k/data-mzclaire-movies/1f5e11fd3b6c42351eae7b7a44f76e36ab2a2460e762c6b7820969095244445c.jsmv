It is named after a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Ford Madox Brown. | Jarman wrote a book to accompany the film, which deals more explicitly with the relationship he had with his father, who was a Lancaster bomber pilot in the Second World War. Jarman used the impact of his father's despair, depression and violence on his own artistic vision. The depression that his father suffered is attributed to the high number of fatalities that bomber crews experienced and the carpet-bombing of civilians. The film is also a means to explore his vision of the dissolution of traditional (pre-war) English life[citation needed]. (See his earlier film Jubilee to contextualize it with the 1977 punk movement of the time). | The book and to a lesser extent the film are very much in the tradition of Roland Barthes Camera Lucida, Susan Sontag's On Photography, Jeanette Winterson's 'Art Objects' and to a lesser extent John Berger's Ways of Seeing in that he has used the deeply familiar and personal as a vehicle for dialogue about art and contemporary culture. | Derek Jarman received the 1988 Teddy Award in Berlin for the film.","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Last of England at the Internet Movie Database | The Last of England at AllMovie | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/ff/The_Last_of_England_FilmPoster.jpeg/220px-The_Last_of_England_FilmPoster.jpeg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Derek Jarman"}
