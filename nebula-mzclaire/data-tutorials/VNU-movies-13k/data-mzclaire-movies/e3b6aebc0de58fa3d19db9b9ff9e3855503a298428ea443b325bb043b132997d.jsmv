The Chatham A's baseball field that was used in the film was actually built from a field that had been abandoned for about 20 years. Within about eight weeks the field was complete with batting cages and a press box ready to film. Since the filming of the movie, the field has once again been abandoned and is simply an overgrown field. The majority of the people cast for the roles of the teammates were actual minor-league baseball players. Only seven of the 35 people cast for the roles of the teammates were actors. The baseball players had to attend a four-week training camp during which they learned how to ignore the cameras on the field and to feel and act more as a team. All of the actors had to practice every day.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mike Tollin","m_produced_by":"Mike Tollin Brian Robbins Sam Weisman","m_screenplay_by":"Kevin Falls John Gatins","m_story_by":"Kevin Falls","m_starring":"Freddie Prinze, Jr. Jessica Biel Fred Ward Jason Gedrick Brittany Murphy Gabriel Mann Bruce Davison Marc Blucas Matthew Lillard Brian Dennehy","m_music_by":"George Fenton Tarsha Vega","m_cinematography":"Tim Suhrstedt","m_edited_by":"Harvey Rosenstock","m_production_company":"Tollin/Robbins","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.
