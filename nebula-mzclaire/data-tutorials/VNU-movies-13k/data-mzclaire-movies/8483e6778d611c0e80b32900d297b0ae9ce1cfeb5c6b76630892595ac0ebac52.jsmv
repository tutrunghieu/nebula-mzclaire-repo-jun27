{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students report at 7:00a.m. for all-day detention at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois. While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common: the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish, the state champion wrestler Andrew Clarke, the bookish Brian Johnson, the reclusive outcast Allison Reynolds, and the rebellious delinquent John Bender. | They gather in the high school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep for the next eight hours and 54 minutes. He assigns them a 1,000-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are.\" He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them. Bender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students, teasing Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire. Allison is initially quiet, except for an occasional random outburst. | The students pass the hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking cannabis that Bender retrieves from his locker. Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew can't easily think for himself, John comes from an abusive household, Brian was planning to kill himself with a flare gun due to a bad grade, and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems, Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible, John's father verbally and physically abuses John, Brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to get good grades and keep it that way, and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. The students realize that even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives. | Despite their differences in social status, the group begins to form friendships (and even romantic relationships) as the day progresses. Claire gives Allison a makeover, to reveal just how pretty she really is, which sparks romantic interest in Andrew. Claire decides to break her \"pristine\" virgin appearance by kissing Bender in the closet and giving him a hickey. Although they suspect that the relationships would end with the end of their detention, their mutual experiences would change the way they would look at their peers afterward. | As the detention comes to its final moments, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone, and Brian agrees, leaving the essay in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. The students part ways outside the school. Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads Brian's essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, \"in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions: a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.\" Brian signs the letter as \"The Breakfast Club.\" As the movie ends, John raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the football field for home.","m_cast":"Judd Nelson as John Bender, the criminal.

Towards the end of filming, Hughes asked them both to be in The Breakfast Club. Hall became the first to be cast, agreeing to the role of Brian Johnson. Ringwald was originally approached to play the character of Allison Reynolds, but she was \"really upset\" because she wanted to play Claire Standish. She eventually convinced the director and the studio to give her the part.[5] The role of Allison ultimately went to Ally Sheedy. | Emilio Estevez originally auditioned for the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clarke, Estevez was recast. Nicolas Cage was considered for the role of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to John Cusack and Judd Nelson. Hughes eventually cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes got disappointed at Nelson because he stayed in character by harassing Ringwald off-camera, and the other actors had to convince Hughes not to fire him.[5][6] | Rick Moranis was originally cast as the janitor but left due to creative differences and was replaced by John Kapelos.[7] | In 1999, Hughes said that his request to direct the film met with resistance and skepticism because he lacked filmmaking experience.[8] Hughes ultimately convinced the film's investors that due to the modest $1 million budget and its single location shoot, he could greatly minimize their risk. | Hughes originally thought that The Breakfast Club would be his directorial debut. Unabashedly inexperienced, Hughes opted for an insular, largely one room set and wrote it about high school students, who would be played by younger actors.[9] | Principal photography began on March 28, 1984, and ended in May of that year. Filming took place at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, Illinois, shuttered in 1981. The same setting was used for interior scenes of Hughes' 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which featured exterior shots from nearby Glenbrook North High School. | The library at Maine North High School, considered too small for the film, prompted the crew to build the set in the school's gymnasium.[10] The actors rehearsed with each other for three weeks and then shot the film in sequence.[11] Some of the posters on the walls during filming of The Breakfast Club can also be seen in Ferris Bueller. On the Ferris Bueller's Day Off DVD commentary (featured on the 2004 DVD version), John Hughes revealed that he shot the two films back-to-back to save time and money, and some outtakes of both films feature elements of the film crews working on the other film. | The first print clocked in at 150 minutes.[12] During a cast reunion in honor of the film's 25th anniversary, Ally Sheedy revealed that a Director's Cut existed but Hughes' widow did not disclose any details concerning its whereabouts.[6] | The main theme of the film is the constant struggle of the American teenager to be understood, by adults and by themselves. It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures. On the surface, the students have little in common with each other. However, as the day rolls on, they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations.[13][14] The main adult character, Mr. Vernon, is not portrayed in a positive light. He consistently talks down to the students and flaunts his authority throughout the film. Bender is the only one who stands up to Vernon.[13] | Stereotyping is another theme. Once the obvious stereotypes are broken down, the characters \"empathize with each other's struggles, dismiss some of the inaccuracies of their first impressions, and discover that they are more similar than different.\"[15] | The film's poster, featuring the five characters huddled together, was photographed by Annie Leibovitz toward the end of shooting. The shot of five actors gazing at the camera influenced the way teen films were marketed from that point on.[16] The poster refers to the five \"types\" of the story using slightly different terms than those used in the film, and in a different sequence, stating \"They were five total strangers with nothing in common, meeting for the first time. A brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse.\"","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Hughes","m_produced_by":"Ned Tanen John Hughes","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Emilio Estevez | Paul Gleason | Anthony Michael Hall | Judd Nelson | Molly Ringwald | Ally Sheedy","m_music_by":"Keith Forsey Gary Chang","m_cinematography":"Thomas Del Ruth","m_edited_by":"Dede Allen","m_production_company":"A&M Films Channel Productions","m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"February 15, 1985 (1985-02-15) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"97 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$1 million[2]","m_box_office":"$51.5 million[3] | The Breakfast Club is a 1985 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes and starring Emilio Estevez, Paul Gleason, Anthony Michael Hall, John Kapelos, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy. The storyline follows five teenagers, each a member of a different high school clique, who spend a Saturday in detention together and come to realize that they are all more than their respective stereotypes, while facing a strict disciplinarian. | Critics consider it one of the greatest high school films of all time, as well as one of Hughes' most memorable and recognizable works. The media referred to the film's five main actors as members of a group called the \"Brat Pack\". | The Breakfast Club's title comes from the nickname invented by students and staff for morning detention at New Trier High School, the school attended by the son of one of John Hughes' friends. Thus, those who were sent to detention before school starting time were designated members of \"The Breakfast Club\". | The film was digitally remastered and was re-screened throughout 430 theaters in celebration of its 30th anniversary in 2015.[4] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE BREAKFAST CLUB | British Board of Film Classification\".
