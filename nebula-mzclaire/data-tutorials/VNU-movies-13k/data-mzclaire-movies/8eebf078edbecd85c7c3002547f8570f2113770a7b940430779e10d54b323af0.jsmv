{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Former Irish pugilist & Provisional IRA member Danny Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis) returns home to Belfast from a 14-year stint in prison at the age of 32. Weary of the unbroken cycle of violence in Northern Ireland, he attempts to settle down and live in peace. After meeting his drink-sodden old trainer Ike (Ken Stott), Danny starts up a non-sectarian boxing club for boys in an old gymnasium. While fixing up the old building, however, he runs across a cache of Semtex hidden underneath the stage. He throws the cache into the river. | Danny's action infuriates Harry (Gerard McSorley), a bitter and ruthless IRA lieutenant. Harry feuds with Danny, assassinating the kindly police officer who donates equipment to the boxing club. The murder causes a riot at one of Danny's boxing matches. During the riot, the gymnasium is burned down by Liam, the young son of Maggie, who thinks Danny and his mother are going to elope. | Danny has been reconnecting with an old flame, Maggie (Emily Watson), now married to an imprisoned IRA man and required by IRA code to remain faithful to him. Their relationship dominates much of the film. Harry sees Danny and Maggie's relationship as a way to undermine the authority of her father, Joe Hamill (Brian Cox), the grim but war-weary IRA local commander who is working for peace. | Eventually, Harry and some other IRA men kidnap Danny and take him away to be executed. Then, in a last-minute twist, the IRA gunman shoots Harry instead of Danny, thus eliminating a rogue agent. Maggie with Liam her son in the car pick up Danny and they all drive home together.","m_cast":"Daniel Day-Lewis as Danny Flynn | Emily Watson as Maggie | Brian Cox as Joe Hamill | Ken Stott as Ike Weir | Gerard McSorley as Harry | Ian McElhinney as Reggie Bell | Ciarán Fitzgerald as Liam","m_reception":"Reviews of the film were generally positive; the review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 80% of the 70 reviews tallied were positive.[3] UFC commentator Joe Rogan has stated that Day-Lewis' performance is the \"best he's ever seen\" of an actor playing a boxer.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jim Sheridan","m_produced_by":"Arthur Lappin Jim Sheridan","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Daniel Day-Lewis Emily Watson","m_music_by":"Gavin Friday Maurice Seezer","m_cinematography":"Chris Menges","m_edited_by":"Gerry Hambling","m_production_company":"Universal Pictures Hell's Kitchen Films","m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"31 December 1997 (1997-12-31) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"113 minutes","m_country":"Ireland","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$16.5 million | The Boxer is a 1997 film by Irish director Jim Sheridan.
