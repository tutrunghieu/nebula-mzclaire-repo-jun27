{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1945, the USS Indianapolis, led by Captain Charles McVay (Nicolas Cage), delivers parts of the atomic bomb that would later be used to level Hiroshima during the ending of World War II. While patrolling the Philippine Sea, on July 30th, 1945, the ship is torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. 300 crewmen go down with the ship, while the rest climb out of the ship and are left stranded at sea for five days without food, water and left among shark-infested waters. Without any hope for 5 days, most of the crew are eaten by sharks or die of salt-water poisoning by drinking sea water. On the 5th day, the crew are rescued by an airplane pilot who spots them by chance and calls for a rescue. Only 317 survive the disaster. Looking for a scapegoat for their own negligence, the navy court-martials and convicts Captain McVay for \"hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag\" despite overwhelming evidence supporting McVay.","m_cast":"Nicolas Cage as Captain Charles Butler McVay[1] | Tom Sizemore as Chief Petty Officer McWhorter[2] | Thomas Jane as Lieutenant (JG) Wilbur C. \"Chuck\" Gwinn[3] | Matt Lanter as Chief Petty Officer Brian \"Bama\" Smithwick[4] | Brian Presley[3] as Waxman | Cody Walker as Lieutenant West[5] | Emily Tennant as Clara | Callard Harris as Lieutenant Standish | Mandela Van Peebles as Theodore | Weronika Rosati as Louise, McVay's wife | Yutaka Takeuchi as Commander Mochitsura Hashimoto | Justin Nesbitt as Lindy | Matthew Pearson as Duece","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The project USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage, set in July 1945, is about the Navy ship USS Indianapolis and was first announced in 2011 by Hannibal Classics. Near the end of World War II—when the ship was returning from Tinian after delivering important parts for an atomic bomb—it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.[6][7] 1,197 people were aboard the ship, out of which only 317 survived, almost 300 sank along with the ship, and all others were killed by dehydration, exposure, salt water poisoning, or shark attacks.[6][7] Cam Cannon and Richard Rionda Del Castro, the latter also being engaged as a producer, wrote the script for the film. The focus of the film is on the bravery of the crewmen aboard the USS Indianapolis.[7] On December 17, 2013, Hannibal set Mario Van Peebles to direct the film, while Patriot Pictures would finance and Rionda Del Castro would produce along with Michael Mendelsohn.[6] The studio (Hannibal) had developed the film in five years by consulting the survivors of the disaster, including the US Navy and the US Coast Guard. The US Navy helped with the completion and finalization of the last draft of the script.[1][6] Walt Conti of Edge Innovations would provide the animated sharks, and the production reportedly secured two fully operational WWII-era planes to portray the planes that were involved in the real rescue operations after the disaster.[3] Silo Inc. and Hydroflex were attached to handle digital effects and underwater filming for the film, respectively.[1] USS Alabama and USS Drum would both be used along with the Battleship Memorial Park to depict as the USS Indianapolis and the Japanese submarine.[3] | On February 5, 2015, Nicolas Cage was set to play the lead role of Captain Charles McVay in the film.[1] Matt Lanter was set on April 1, 2015 to play a US Navy diver, named Chief Petty Officer Brian \"Bama\" Smithwick.[4] Lanter revealed to the producers after his audition that his grandfather, Kenley Lanter, was a Signalman on the USS Indianapolis. Furthermore, Lanter's father, Joe Lanter, is a chairman of Second Watch, an organization of survivors and their families. Joe Lanter and his co-chair, Maria Bullard, stayed in contact with the producers during pre-production and were welcomed to the set during photography. On May 13, 2015, Variety revealed that Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane and Brian Presley had also joined the cast of the film, in which Sizemore would play McWhorter, one of the crew on the ship, while Jane was to play the pilot Chuck Gwinn.[3] In May 2015, Saban Films acquired the North American distribution rights to the film.[3] On May 18, 2015, Sizemore's role was confirmed by Variety.[2] On July 15, 2015, Cody Walker was cast in the film to play one of the crewmen aboard the ship.[5] | Principal photography on the film began on June 19, 2015 in Mobile, Alabama.[8][9] Filming was also to take place in San Francisco and Kyoto, Japan,[3] but the producers later opted to double Mobile for both San Francisco and Japan. On June 27, 2015, filming was underway in Orange Beach.[10] A World War II-era vintage seaplane PBY Catalina was being used for the filming on June 29, 2015, when it took on water and beached near the Flora-Bama lounge, Orange Beach.[11] There were no injuries during the incident, and the rescue team secured the pilot and co-pilot.[12] Producers had to put the production on hold temporarily to save the plane, but \"the salvage company was unable to save the aircraft,\" which was broken apart, according to the producers.[12][13] The plane was provided by firefighters from Washington and was being piloted by Fred and Jayson Owen.[14] After filming on July 14 in downtown Mobile, Cage met a real Navy veteran named Richard Stephens on a Bienville Square's bench, Stephens was one of the survivors of the ship, so Cage and Stephens had a long talk about the disaster.[15]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mario Van Peebles","m_produced_by":"Michael Mendelsohn Richard Rionda Del Castro","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Nicolas Cage Tom Sizemore Thomas Jane Matt Lanter Brian Presley Cody Walker","m_music_by":"Laurent Eyquem","m_cinematography":"Andrzej Sekuła","m_edited_by":"Robert A.
