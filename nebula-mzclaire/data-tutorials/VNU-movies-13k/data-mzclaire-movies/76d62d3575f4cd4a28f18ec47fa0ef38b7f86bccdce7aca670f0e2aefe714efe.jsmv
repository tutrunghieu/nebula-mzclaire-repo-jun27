{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Four angels — Charlie (Charles Durning), Earl (Scatman Crothers), Gonzales (Castulo Guerra), and Ruth (Beatrice Straight) — have been in charge of Heaven for the last 25 years. They are playing a golf match in Heaven when their game is interrupted by God, who has returned to the office and does not like what he sees down on Earth. God wants to order up another flood and start all over again (despite his promise in the rainbow that he never would again), but the four angels persuade him to reconsider, reasoning that, if a typical Earth man can reform, it would prove that all mankind is capable of it. | God agrees to the scheme, and the typical Earth man selected by the angels is Zack Melon (John Travolta) — a failed inventor who, threatened by loan sharks, decides to hold up a bank. Zack points his gun at bank teller Debbie Wylder (Olivia Newton-John), who ostensibly gives him all the money. But, when Zack peers into the sack after the robbery, he sees that Debbie has substituted bank deposit slips for the cash and has kept the money for herself. Zack tracks her down to reclaim his stolen money. While dodging the loan sharks and the evil interventions of the Devil (Oliver Reed), the two come to develop a relationship, which is put to the test when the two are threatened by a masked thug.","m_cast":"John Travolta as Zack Melon | Olivia Newton-John as Debbie Wylder | Charles Durning as Charlie | Oliver Reed as Beasley | Beatrice Straight as Ruth | Scatman Crothers as Earl | Richard Bright as Stuart | Toni Kalem as Terri | Ernie Hudson as Detective Skaggs | Jack Kehoe as Mr. Chotiner | Robert Costanzo as Captain Cinzari | Castulo Guerra as Gonzales | Gene Hackman as God (uncredited) (Hackman would later work with Travolta in Get Shorty)","m_reception":"Two of a Kind received heavily negative reviews during its release.[2] It currently holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. | The film was nominated for five Razzie Awards: Worst Actor (Travolta, also for Staying Alive), Worst Actress (Newton-John), Worst Director (Herzfeld), Worst Screenplay, and Worst Picture.

These two unlikely individuals must come to show compassion for one another in order to delay God's judgment upon the Earth. This is Travolta and Newton-John's second film together after 1978's Grease, which was a success. Two of a Kind was unsuccessful both critically and commercially, but did yield three popular singles for Newton-John and a platinum rating for the soundtrack. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Two of a Kind at American Film Institute Catalog | ^ \"THE SCREEN: TRAVOLTA IN 'TWO OF KIND'\".
