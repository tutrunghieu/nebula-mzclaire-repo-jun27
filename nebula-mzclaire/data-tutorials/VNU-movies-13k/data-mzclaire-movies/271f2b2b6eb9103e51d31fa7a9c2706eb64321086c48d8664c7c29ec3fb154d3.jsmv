The film satirically interweaves the story of the real hospital with a fantasy hospital which exists in a soap-opera world where all the equipment is new and patients are miraculously cured - although the only \"patients\" seen are doctors or nurses who are themselves part of the soap opera plots. In the real hospital, the patients die while the out-of-touch administrators focus on impressing foreign visitors.","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/43839","m_external_link":"The National Health at the Internet Movie Database | The National Health at the TCM Movie Database | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/Film_Poster_for_The_National_Health.jpg/200px-Film_Poster_for_The_National_Health.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Peter Nichols"}
