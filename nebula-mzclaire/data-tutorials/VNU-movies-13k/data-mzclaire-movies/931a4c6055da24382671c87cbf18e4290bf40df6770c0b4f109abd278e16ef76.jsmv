Odessa and her family confront typical issues faced by African Americans in the South at the time: poverty, racism, segregation, and violence. The black community has begun a widespread boycott of the city-owned buses to end segregation; Odessa takes on a long walk both ways to work. | Miriam Thompson offers to give her a ride two days a week to ensure she gets to work on time and to lessen the fatigue her “long walk home” is causing. Around the city, some informal carpools and other systems are starting, but most of the blacks walk to work. | As the boycott continues, tensions rise in the city. Blacks had been the majority riders on the city-owned buses, and the system is suffering financially. Miriam's decision to support Odessa by giving her a ride becomes an issue with her husband, Norman Thompson (Dwight Schultz), and other prominent members of the white community who want the boycott to end. Miriam has to choose between what she believes is right or succumb to pressure from her husband and friends. | After a fight with her husband, Miriam decides to follow her heart. She becomes involved in a carpool group to help other black workers like Odessa. In the film's final scene, Miriam and her daughter Mary Catherine (Lexi Randall), who is the narrator of the story in flashback, join Odessa and the other protesters in standing against oppression.","m_cast":"Sissy Spacek as Miriam Thompson | Whoopi Goldberg as Odessa Cotter | Dwight Schultz as Norman Thompson | Ving Rhames as Herbert Cotter | Dylan Baker as Tunker Thompson | Erika Alexander as Selma Cotter | Lexi Randall as Mary Catherine (as Lexi Faith Randall) | Richard Parnell Habersham as Theodore Cotter | Jason Weaver as Franklin Cotter | Crystal Robbins as Sara Thompson | Cherene Snow as Claudia | Chelcie Ross as Martin | Dan Butler as Charlie | Philip Sterling as Winston | Schuyler Fisk as Judy (Girl at Oak Park) | Mary Steenburgen as Narrator","m_reception":"The Long Walk Home received mostly positive reviews from critics.
