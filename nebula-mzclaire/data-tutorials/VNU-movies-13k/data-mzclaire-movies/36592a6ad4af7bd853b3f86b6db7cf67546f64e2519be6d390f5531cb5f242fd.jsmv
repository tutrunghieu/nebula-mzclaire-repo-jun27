The film takes place over one lunch hour during the course of the month-long competition. The dark comedy often uses surrealism to achieve its goals. | The cast includes Fab Filippo, Don McKellar, Marya Delver and Michelle Beaudoin. | The film's title is derived from a particular form of suicide where one smashes the (non-openable) window of one's high-rise office and then jumps through. Many people go \"downtown\", but such folks go \"waydowntown\". In the movie, one of the characters has accumulated a 2-litre pop bottle full of marbles in the hopes of breaking his window.","m_cast":"Fab Filippo as Tom | Don McKellar as Brad | Marya Delver as Sandra West | Gordon Currie as Curt Schwin | Jennifer Clement as Vicki | Tammy Isbell as Kathy | Tobias Godson as Randy | James McBurney as Phil","m_reception":"The film as of May 1, 2009 has a 70% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The film takes place in Calgary, Alberta, where many downtown buildings are connected by a network of skywalks called Plus 15. As a result, the hustle and bustle of the main street has been replaced by recirculated air, food courts, and fluorescent lights. This is the setting for Burns' sardonic comedy about Canadian corporate culture. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Waydowntown Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes","m_external_link":"National Film Board's rental page for waydowntown | Waydowntown at the Internet Movie Database | waydowntown at Rotten Tomatoes","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Waydowntown-movie-poster.jpg/220px-Waydowntown-movie-poster.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Gary Burns James Martin"}
