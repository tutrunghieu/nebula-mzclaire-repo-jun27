{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Jerry Kwan (Jackie Chan) leads a very easy-going life with his girlfriend, Nancy (Kristine DeBell), and his family. His father owns a restaurant, and one day, he is threatened by the mob to pay a part of his profits. As the mob exits, Jerry enters the scene and rushes out the door to catch up with them. He answers back by taking them on and eventually catches the eye of the mob for his unique and talented fighting abilities. In effect, he is forced to join the Battle Creek Brawl fight in Texas. The mob promises to return his brother's fiancèe and give him the prize money as long as Jerry wins the tournament. He gets help from his uncle a kung-fu teacher to train him for the Battle Creek Brawl. They focus on Jerry's speed and agility as he must fight very tough opponents, one of them including Billy Kiss (H.B. Haggerty), the big, bulky, unbeatable winner from previous battles who kisses his opponents after they are defeated.","m_cast":"Jackie Chan - Jerry Kwan | José Ferrer - Dominici | Kristine DeBell - Nancy | Mako - Herbert | Ron Max - Leggetti | David Sheiner - Morgan | Rosalind Chao - Mae | Lenny Montana - John | Peter Marc - Jug","m_reception":"The movie received negative receptions from critics.[1] | In an interview with Chan on the region 2 DVD, Chan discusses the differences between Chinese and American styles of action. In his early US films, The Big Brawl and The Protector (1985), Chan had to perform the typical American fight sequences involving punches, kicks and taking few takes, all the way to the end of the action scene. It wasn't until Rumble in the Bronx (1995) that Chan was allowed to use more of his preferred action style, in which he works together with his stunt team and the actors (and actresses) involved in the films he's involved in. Also is allowed to get as many takes until its right for the film.[2] | In his autobiography \"I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action\", there was one scene in the production in which Robert Clouse is not interested in Chan's idea which is to flip out of the car and had wanted him to just walk from the car to his father restaurant. Chan quote's \"No one will pay money to see Jackie Chan walk!\" The reason he believes this film failed was because he wasn't given a chance to direct the action scenes the way he wanted them for the film.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Clouse","m_produced_by":"Raymond Chow Fred Weintraub","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jackie Chan José Ferrer Kristine DeBell Mako David Sheiner Rosalind Chao","m_music_by":"Lalo Schifrin","m_cinematography":"Robert C.
