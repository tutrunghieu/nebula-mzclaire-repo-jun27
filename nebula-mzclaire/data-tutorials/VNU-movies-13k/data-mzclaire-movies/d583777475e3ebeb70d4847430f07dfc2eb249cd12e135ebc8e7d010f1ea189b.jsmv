{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After returning home from a five-year prison sentence, John \"Goldie\" Mickens, (Max Julien) has a plan to achieve money and power in Oakland, California by becoming a pimp. Goldie’s criminal ways juxtapose his brother Olinga’s Roger E. Mosley Black Nationalist efforts to save the community from drugs and violence. With Slim (Richard Pryor) as his partner and Lulu (Carol Speed as his head prostitute, he organizes a team of women and quickly rises to prominence. His success catches the attention of Fat Man (George Murdock), the heroin kingpin that Goldie worked for before heading to prison, and Hank (Don Gordon) and Jed (William Watson), two corrupt and racist white detectives. Goldie refuses to work for Fat Man again, and dismisses the detectives requests to stop his brother from ridding the streets of drugs. As a result, his mother is assaulted which eventually leads to her death. Even though Olinga is disappointed in Goldie because he “brought death to their house,” he agrees to help him get revenge. They develop a plan with Slim to seek revenge, but their plans fall apart when Hank and Jed kill Slim at their rendezvous point. They reveal that they are responsible for Goldie’s mother’s death, causing Goldie and Olinga to kill them both. Realizing that Oakland is now too dangerous, Goldie hugs his brother goodbye and leaves the city on a charter bus. | Cast: | Max Julien as Goldie | Richard Pryor as Slim | Juanita Moore as Mother | Carol Speed as Lulu | Roger E.

Despite low distribution the film still managed to outgross “The Godfather” in those same cities. The soundtrack for the film, done by Motown artist Willie Hutch, still managed to receive a lot of popularity with the songs “Brother’s Gonna Work It Out” and “Slick” becoming hit singles on the soul chart. Over the years the movie has evolved into a cult classic, and the term “mack” has infiltrated pop culture. Jay-Z, Too Short, Tupac, and Mark Morrison are a few of the Hip-Hop artists who paid homage to the film either through their lyrics or by sampling the soundtrack.[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Campus","m_produced_by":"Harvey Bernhard","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Max Julien Richard Pryor Carol Speed Roger E.
