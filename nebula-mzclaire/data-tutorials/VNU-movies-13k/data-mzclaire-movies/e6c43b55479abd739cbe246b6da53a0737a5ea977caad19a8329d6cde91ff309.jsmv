{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sister Mary Bonaventure is in charge of the hospital ward of a convent in the county of Norfolk, England. She is troubled by her own sister's suicide, which she confides to her Mother Superior. | A torrential rain closes nearby roads, causing Sergeant Melling of the police to bring condemned murderer Valerie Carns there. She is being taken to prison. | Valerie was convicted of poisoning her brother Jason, a pianist. Jason's physician, Dr. Jeffreys, is head of the hospital where Sister Mary now works. Valerie still proclaims her innocence, but Jeffreys insists that she gave Jason a fatal overdose of his medicine. | A photograph of Jason clearly disturbs Isabel Jeffreys, the doctor's wife. He gives her a sedative. Valerie appeals to Sister Mary to bring her fiance, Sidney Kingham, to the convent to see her. A servant tells Sister Mary about the sadistic behavior of Jason Carns and produces a love letter to him, clearly written by Isabel. | Mother Superior is upset by Sister Mary's meddling. She burns the letter. The nun still intends to tell Melling the police sergeant what she knows. | Dr. Jeffreys is the one who gave Jason the fatal dose, and he might be slowly poisoning Isabel as well. He lures Sister Mary to a bell tower, where he attacks her. She rings the bell. Sidney hears it, rushes to her aid and overpowers Jeffreys, who is arrested by Melling. | Sister Mary's faith is restored, believing the rain that delivered Valerie to her to be divine intervention.","m_cast":"Claudette Colbert as Sister Mary | Ann Blyth as Valerie Carns | Robert Douglas as Dr. Jeffreys | Anne Crawford as Isabel Jeffreys | Philip Friend as Sidney Kingham | Gladys Cooper as Mother Superior | Michael Pate as Willie | John Abbott as Abel Harmer | Connie Gilchrist as Sister Josephine | Gavin Muir as Melling | Phyllis Stanley as Nurse Phillips | Norma Varden as Pierce | Valerie Cardew as Nurse Colby | Queenie Leonard as Mrs. Smithson | Patrick O'Moore as Mr. Smithson","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Douglas Sirk","m_produced_by":"Michael Kraike","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Claudette Colbert Ann Blyth Robert Douglas Gladys Cooper Michael Pate","m_music_by":"Hans J.
