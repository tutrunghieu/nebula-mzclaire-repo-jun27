{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), a master barrister in ill health, takes on Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) as a client, despite the objections of his private nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester), who says the doctor warns him against taking on any criminal cases. Vole is accused of murdering Mrs Emily French (Norma Varden), a rich, older widow who had become enamoured with him, going so far as to make him the main beneficiary of her will. Strong circumstantial evidence points to Vole as the killer, but Sir Wilfrid believes Vole is innocent. | When Sir Wilfrid speaks with Vole's German wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), he finds her rather cold and self-possessed, but she does provide an alibi. Therefore, he is greatly surprised when she is called as a witness for the prosecution. While a wife cannot testify against her husband, Christine was in fact still married to a German man when she wed Leonard (who was in the Army and part of the occupation forces in Germany). She testifies that Leonard admitted to her that he had killed Mrs French, and that her conscience forced her to finally tell the truth. | During the trial in the Old Bailey, Sir Wilfrid is contacted by a mysterious woman who, for a fee, provides him with letters written by Christine herself to a mysterious lover named Max. The affair revealed by this correspondence gives Christine such a strong motive to have lied that the jury finds Leonard not guilty. | However, Sir Wilfrid is troubled by the verdict. His instincts tell him that it was \"...too neat, too tidy, and altogether...too symmetrical!\" His belief proves correct when Christine, left alone with him by chance in the courtroom, takes the opportunity to take credit for the verdict. Sir Wilfrid had told her before the trial that \"...no jury would believe an alibi given by a loving wife\". So, she had instead given testimony implicating her husband, had then forged the letters to the non-existent Max, and had herself in disguise played the mysterious woman handing over the letters which then discredited her own testimony and led to the acquittal. She furthermore admits that she saved Leonard even though she knew he was guilty because she loves him. | Leonard has overheard Christine's admission and, now protected by double jeopardy, cheerfully confirms to Sir Wilfred that he had indeed killed Mrs French. Sir Wilfrid is infuriated at being had. Leonard then coldly tells Christine that he has met a younger woman (Ruta Lee) and is leaving Christine. In a jealous rage, Christine grabs a knife, which had earlier been used as evidence by the defence (and subtly highlighted by Sir Wilfrid's monocle light-reflection), and stabs Leonard to death. After she is taken away by the police, Sir Wilfrid, urged on by Miss Plimsoll, declares that he will take on Christine's defence.","m_cast":"Tyrone Power as Leonard Vole, the accused | Marlene Dietrich as Christine Vole/Helm, the accused's wife | Charles Laughton as Sir Wilfrid Robarts Q.C., senior counsel for Vole | Elsa Lanchester as Miss Plimsoll, Sir Wilfrid's private nurse | John Williams as Mr Brogan-Moore, Sir Wilfrid's junior counsel in the trial | Henry Daniell as Mayhew, Vole's solicitor who instructs Sir Wilfrid on the case | Ian Wolfe as Carter, Sir Wilfrid's clerk and office manager | Torin Thatcher as Mr Myers, the Crown prosecutor | Norma Varden as Mrs Emily Jane French, the elderly woman who was murdered | Una O'Connor as Janet McKenzie, Mrs French's housekeeper and a prosecution witness | Francis Compton as the Judge | Philip Tonge as Chief Inspector Hearne, the arresting officer | Ruta Lee as Diana, a young woman with a secret, watching the trial | Patrick Aherne as the court officer | Marjorie Eaton as Miss O'Brien | Franklyn Farnum as an old barrister | Bess Flowers as a courtroom spectator | Colin Kenny as a juror | Ottola Nesmith as Miss Johnson | J Pat O'Malley as the shorts salesman | Jack Raine as Sir Wilfrid's doctor | Ben Wright as court clerk (the officer reading charges) | This was Power's final completed film.

The play was adjusted to build up the character of the defence barrister.[1] Billy Wilder was signed to direct in April 1956.[2] | Laughton based his performance on Florance Guedella, his own lawyer, an Englishman who was well known for twirling his monocle while cross-examining witnesses.[1] | Vivien Leigh and Marlene Dietrich were leading candidates to play the female lead.[3] | In a flashback showing how Leonard and Christine first meet in a German nightclub, she is wearing her trademark trousers.

Billy Wilder did not give the actors the final ten pages of the script until it was time to shoot those scenes. The secrecy reportedly cost Marlene Dietrich an Academy Award, as United Artists didn't want to call attention to the fact that Dietrich was practically unrecognisable as the Cockney woman who hands over the incriminating letters to the defence.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Witness for the Prosecution 1925 story  by Agatha Christie","m_directed_by":"Billy Wilder","m_produced_by":"Arthur Hornblow Jr.","m_screenplay_by":"Larry Marcus Billy Wilder Harry Kurnitz","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tyrone Power Marlene Dietrich Charles Laughton","m_music_by":"Matty Malneck Ralph Arthur Robert","m_cinematography":"Russell Harlan","m_edited_by":"Daniel Mandell","m_production_company":"Edward Small Productions","m_distributed_by":"United Artists","m_release_dates":"December 17, 1957 (Limited U.S. release) 30 January 1958 (Premiere, London)","m_running_time":"116 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$3 million","m_box_office":"$9 million | Witness for the Prosecution is a 1957 American courtroom drama film with elements of Film Noir set in the Old Bailey in London.
