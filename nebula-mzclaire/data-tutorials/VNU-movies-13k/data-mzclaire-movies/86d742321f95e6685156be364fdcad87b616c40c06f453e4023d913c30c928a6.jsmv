{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Annie and Matthew, a young married couple, find their infant child screaming with a high temperature and an earache. Matthew calls the doctor, who promises to phone in a prescription to the pharmacist the following day. However, during the night, the neighborhood wakes up due to a massive power outage. When Matthew visits the pharmacist the next day, he is unable to get the required medicine due to the blackout. Matthew steals the medicine when the pharmacist is not looking. | Social unrest ensues due to the persistent blackout, leading Matthew and his wife's best friend, Joe, to buy a gun. When an intruder breaks into the couple's house during the night, the two men chase him outside, where a neighbor shoots the intruder. The neighbors conspire to cover up the fact that the deceased intruder was not armed. | As the blackout continues for days, over a massive (but undefined) area, more chaos occurs. The group decides to flee to Annie's parents' house, 530 miles (850 km) away. They do not have enough fuel to travel the whole way, so they stop by an abandoned car hoping to siphon some. A man is lying in the backseat. Joe notices that the man has a handgun, so he heads back to their vehicle to get his own shotgun. Joe aims the shotgun at the man to scare him off, but the man shoots Joe and steals their vehicle. | Matthew walks an hour to a farmhouse to try to get help for his family. The occupant refuses to help him initially, as he does not trust him. Matthew collects the shotgun and returns to the house, hoping to steal the car. Matthew breaks in to get the car keys, and a standoff ensues between the owner and him. When the man's young daughter enters the room, Matthew returns to the civility and trust that has been missing since the blackout started, lowering his weapon. The man agrees to help Matthew. | Society return to its previous normal once the power returns, though Annie, Matthew and their neighbors are somewhat different from their experience.","m_cast":"Kyle MacLachlan as Matthew | Elisabeth Shue as Annie Kay | Dermot Mulroney as Joe | Bill Smitrovich as Steph | Michael Rooker as Gary | Richard T.
