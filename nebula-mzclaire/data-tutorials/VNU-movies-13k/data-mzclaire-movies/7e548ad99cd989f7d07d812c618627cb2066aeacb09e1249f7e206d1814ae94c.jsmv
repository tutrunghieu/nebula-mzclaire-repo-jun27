Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff by surprise. Corman admitted, \"We anticipated that the movie would do well... but not half as well as it did.\" According to Richard Matheson, \"When the first film was a hit, they still didn't consider doing a Poe series. They just wanted another movie with a Poe title fixed to it.\"[9] | Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after Usher were Masque of the Red Death, and Pit and the Pendulum. He considered making the former but was worried about similarities between the story and The Seventh Seal (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter.[10] However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film \"because it was a lot more graphic and in the second place, Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so when we did finally make Masque of the Red Death we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it.\"[11] | Matheson's script freely devised an elaborate narrative that barely resembled Poe, with only the finale having any similarity at all to the original short story on which the film was based. Corman noted, \"The method we adopted on The Pit and the Pendulum was to use the Poe short story as the climax for a third act to the motion picture... because a two-page short story is not about to give you a ninety-minute motion picture. We then constructed the first two acts in what we hoped was a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen.\"[12] | Matheson says he used the outline for a novel he was starting to work on called House of the Dead as the basis of the screenplay. He also used elements from other Poe stories, such as the unfaithful wife from The Cask of Amontillado and the fact that a favourite book of Roderick Usher from The House of Usher was The Inquisition Directorium.[11] | Matheson's screenplay included a flashback to a time immediately preceding Elizabeth's illness, featuring Nicholas and Elizabeth horseback-riding and eating a picnic lunch. Corman deleted the sequence prior to filming because he felt it violated one of his major theories regarding the Poe series: | I had a lot of theories I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.[13] | The screenplay was modified from its original draft form during the film's shooting. Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character. In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. Don Medina responds: \"Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (turning) What brings you to us?\" Price penciled in the suggestions \"that must be kept in constant repair\" and \"that cannot be stopped\". Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. During Nicholas' death scene, after falling to the bottom of the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, \"Elizabeth. What have I done to you? (beat) What have I done to you?\" The camera was to then cut directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.[13] | The Pit and the Pendulum was announced in August 1960, and filming began the first week of January 1961. | According to Lucy Chase Williams' book, The Complete Films of Vincent Price, the shooting schedule was fifteen days, and the film's budget was almost $1 million.[13] Corman himself has said that the film's actual production cost was approximately $300,000.[14][15][16] | Corman has noted that making the film was a pleasurable experience: \"I enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum because I actually got the chance to experiment a bit with the movement of the camera. There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting cutting in the climax of the film.\"[9] | Filming went smoothly, and Corman attributed the ease of the production's shoot to the short but comprehensive pre-production planning he did with the major technicians: | We achieved what we did on a low budget because we carefully planned the whole production in advance of starting the cameras. Thus, when we moved into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. Because of our pre-production conferences with director of photography Floyd Crosby and art director Daniel Haller, everyone knew exactly what to do, barring any last minute inspirations on the set.[17] | To create the flashbacks revealing Nicholas' traumatic experiences, Corman and Crosby attempted to shoot them in a manner that would convey to the audience the character's horror in dredging up nightmares trapped in his subconscious. Corman insisted on these images having a dream-like quality, \"twisted and distorted because they were being experienced by someone on the rim of madness\". Corman decided to film the flashbacks in monochrome, since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in \"black-and white\" imagery. Crosby used wide-angle lenses,[18] violent camera movement, and tilted camera angles to represent the character's feeling of hysteria. The sequences were then printed on blue-tinted stock which was subsequently toned red during development, effectively producing a two-tone image. The highlights were blue, with the shadows rendered as red...producing a deep, bloody quality. The image was then run through an optical printer where the edges were vignetted and a twisted linear distortion was introduced.[17] | The film's brief exterior prologue showing Kerr's arrival to the castle was filmed on the Palos Verdes coast. The rest of the production was shot in four interior sound stages at the California Studios in Hollywood. To provide great freedom for the planned camera movements, a castle set with many levels and ample space was designed by Daniel Haller. | Because of the film's low budget, none of the sets could be constructed \"from scratch.\" After Haller made sketches and floor plans for the sets, he searched the backlots and property lofts of the major studios in search of available set units that could be inexpensively rented and then put together to form the sets he had conceived. At Universal Studios, he located numerous discarded pieces from old productions, including massive archways, fireplaces, windows and doorways, and several torture machine props. At other studios, he found gigantic stairways and stone wall units. Haller selected and rented numerous pieces from these various depositories and had them delivered to California Studios, where the sets for the film were constructed, following his floor plans as closely as possible.[17] To further set the atmosphere, about 20 gallons of cobwebbing was sprayed throughout the castle's sets.[19] | The film's pressbook noted that the pendulum was eighteen-feet long and weighed over a ton and was constructed with a realistic rubber cutting blade. The pendulum was rigged from the top of the sound stage thirty-five feet in the air.[15] In an interview, Haller provided details regarding the creation of the pendulum: | I found that such a pendulum actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. The problem was to get it in exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.[14] | To visually enhance the size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40Â mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted at the opposite end of the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.[17] | Vincent Price as Nicholas/Sebastian Medina. This was Price's third film for American International Pictures and his second for director Corman.[20] In response to the profitability of House of Usher, Price \"upped his asking price for Pit to $125,000, plus a percentage of the profits.\"[16] Most critics seemed to enjoy Price's somewhat hammy performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden victim of his \"late\" wife's evil machinations. Darrell Moore wrote, \"Vincent Price returns to his usual overacting, ego-tripping self in The Pit and the Pendulum. His wonderfully maniacal performance is the high point of the film.\"[21] And Nathaniel Thompson noted that \"Vincent Price has a field day alternating from gibbering terror to teeth-gnashing insanity (sometimes in the same scene)...\"[22] Some, however, thought his acting overly theatrical and damaging to the film's mood. Writer Ken Hanke felt the film had \"...a few unintended laughs thanks to Vinnie's campiness.\"[23] | John Kerr as Francis Barnard. The Tony Award-winning actor (for Tea and Sympathy (1955)) had been a once-promising leading man in the 1950s, featured in major roles in the theatrical film versions of Tea and Sympathy (1956) and Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific (1958). His role as the nominal hero in Pit would prove to be the last notable film appearance of his career.[24] Years later, Kerr expressed surprise that Pit seemed to be his best remembered role, \"If you had told me years ago that Pit and the Pendulum would be The One out of all the stuff I've done, if you had told me that this would be the cult-type movie that people would be collecting memorabilia on, I would have said, 'You're out of your gourd.' Just ... no way. Noooo way!\"[25] | Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. This was Steele's first film since her break-through horror performance in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960). The actress recalled that she was \"in awe\" of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: \"Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one takeâ¦He really went at me and I had the bruises on my throat to prove it. Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt meâa perfect gentlemanâa truly kind figure in spite of his image.\"[26] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's \"thick working class English accent\" was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.[13] | Luana Anders as Catherine Medina. Anders' role as Price's (much younger) sister was one of several appearances she made in AIP productions. Most of these films were directed by Corman. The actress had first met Corman several years previously while both were attending acting classes taught by Jeff Corey in Los Angeles. After Pit, Anders would make two further films with Corman as a director, The Young Racers (1963) and The Trip (1967).[27] | Antony Carbone as Doctor Leon. Like Anders, Carbone was a brief member of Corman's early-1960s \"stock company\" of actors, appearing in four of the director's films during that time. Carbone's only starring role in his career had been in Corman's Creature from the Haunted Sea (1960), which co-starred writer Robert Towne. Pit was Carbone's final appearance in a Corman-directed movie.[15] | Other cast: Patrick Westwood as Maximillian (the servant), Lynette Bernay as Maria (the maid), Larry Turner as Nicholas as child, Mary Menzies as Isabella, Charles Victor as Bartolome.[28] | Prior to the start of filming, Corman had set aside one day of rehearsals with his cast. \"Previously, I had painstakingly rehearsed the actors so there was complete understanding as to what each was to accomplish in each scene. This is most important; there is nothing worse than to be on the set and ready to roll, only to find that director and actor have different views as to how the scene is to be done. Thanks to pre-production planning and rehearsals, there was no time wasted on the set in haggling and making decisions.\"[17]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"\"The Pit and the Pendulum\"Â  by Edgar Allan Poe","m_directed_by":"Roger Corman","m_produced_by":"Roger Corman","m_screenplay_by":"Richard Matheson","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Vincent Price | Barbara Steele | John Kerr | Luana Anders","m_music_by":"Les Baxter","m_cinematography":"Floyd Crosby","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"American International Pictures","m_release_dates":"AugustÂ 12,Â 1961Â (1961-08-12) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"85 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"US$ 300,000","m_box_office":"US$ 2 million[1][2] 204,570 admissions (France)[3] | The Pit and the Pendulum[4] is a 1961 horror film directed by Roger Corman, starring Vincent Price, Barbara Steele, John Kerr, and Luana Anders. The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in sixteenth-century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. | The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's House of Usher released the previous year. Like House, the film features widescreen cinematography by Floyd Crosby, sets designed by art director Daniel Haller, and a film score composed by Les Baxter. A critical and box-office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. The series ended in 1965 with the release of The Tomb of Ligeia. | Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers, from Mario Bava's The Whip and the Body (1963) to Dario Argento's Deep Red (1975).[5][6] Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film.[7] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Corman, Roger and Jerome, Jim.
