{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2035 the crew of the Ares III manned mission to Mars is exploring the Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. An unexpectedly strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), forcing them to hastily leave the planet. During the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm; the last telemetry from his suit indicates no signs of life. With Watney believed dead, mission commander Melissa Lewis orders the remaining crew to return to their orbiting vessel Hermes without him. | Watney awakens after the storm to a low oxygen warning, in pain, and makes his way to the \"Hab,\" or \"habitat,\" the crew's base of operations. He removes a piece of antenna from his suit's biomonitor—which caused the erroneous life-sign readings—and his own torso, stapling himself up. He begins a video diary and realizes that his only chance of rescue is the arrival of the Ares IV crew at the Schiaparelli crater, 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) away, in four years. Calculating that he has enough food to last only 300 sols (roughly 309 days), Watney, a botanist, improvises a farm with Martian soil fertilized with human waste, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes saved for a Thanksgiving meal. He begins to modify the only functional rover to make long journeys across Mars to reach the rescue spot. | Reviewing satellite photos of Mars, mission director Vincent Kapoor and satellite planner Mindy Park see evidence of Watney's activities and realize that he has survived. Despite the objections of Hermes flight director Mitch Henderson, NASA administrator Teddy Sanders decides not to inform the Ares III crew, believing it would distract them from their mission. | Watney takes the rover to retrieve the Pathfinder probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using the lander's camera, he establishes rudimentary communication with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team using the hexadecimal system. NASA instructs Watney to modify the rover to link with Pathfinder so they can communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival, and Sanders authorizes Henderson to inform them. | Henderson and JPL director Bruce Ng formulate a plan to send a space probe to Mars and resupply Watney with enough food to survive until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's airlock malfunctions and explosively decompresses, destroying Watney's crop, Sanders orders the team to speed up the supply mission by skipping the safety inspections. The supply probe explodes shortly after liftoff. | The China National Space Administration offers NASA the \"Tai yang Shen,\" a classified booster that can carry a payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to send Hermes back to Mars more quickly, using the Chinese booster to instead resupply it for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. Lewis and her crew vote unanimously to execute the plan, and NASA—powerless to stop them—proceeds with the resupply as Hermes flies by Earth, using its gravity to slingshot them back to Mars. | After 461 sols, Watney begins the 90 sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for the Ares IV mission has been prepositioned. To rendezvous with Hermes, Watney makes drastic modifications to reduce the MAV's mass, removing equipment including the windows, nose cone, and exterior panels. With Watney on board the gutted MAV, the Hermes crew launches it remotely, but it does not reach the planned speed and altitude. Lewis has Hermes use its maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of its own internal atmosphere to adjust its speed. When even that is not enough, Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit to approach Watney's vessel, but still cannot reach him. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air as a miniature thruster to reach Lewis. The crew is reunited as crowds around the world cheer the news. | After returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for new astronaut candidates. Five years later, on the occasion of the Ares V mission launch, those involved in Watney's rescue have begun new lives.","m_cast":"Damon prepared for the role by a different method than Chastain. He explained, \"For me the rehearsal process was sitting with Ridley and going kind of line-by-line and moment-by-moment through the script and playing out a plan of attack for what we wanted each scene to accomplish.\"[8] Chastain prepared for her role by meeting with astronauts and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. She was inspired by astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson, saying \"She's very matter of fact, very straightforward. My character is dealing with the guilt of leaving a crew member behind, but she's still responsible for the lives of five other crew mates. I tried to play her as Tracy would have been in those moments.\"[9] | The Media Action Network for Asian-Americans (MANAA) criticized the casting of white actor Mackenzie Davis as Mindy Park, who, it claimed, was described by author Andy Weir to be Korean-American. The group also criticized the casting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, who, the MANAA claimed, Weir described as an Asian-Indian character. In the novel, the character's name was Venkat Kapoor, and he identifies religiously as a Hindu. The group called the casting whitewashing and said that Asian actors, being under-represented in Hollywood, were deprived of acting opportunities.[6] Weir said in October 2015 he perceived Mindy Park as Korean but said he did not explicitly write her as Korean. He also dismissed criticism of Ejiofor's casting as Kapoor, \"He's an American. Americans come from lots of different sources. You can be Venkat Kapoor and black.\"[7] In the original novel Weir intentionally avoided including the physical descriptions of his characters.[7]","m_reception":"The Martian received critical acclaim upon release. Critics commended the visual effects, the scientific accuracy, and the film's likability, largely due to Matt Damon's performance.[112] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative, surveyed 290 critics and determined that 92% of the reviews were positive with a rating average of 7.9 out of 10, and the consensus \"Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny, The Martian offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott.\"[113] The site further stated that critics observed that Scott \"examin[ed] more hopeful territory\" than in his past films, and \"the result is an awe-inspiring adventure that explores vast ideas while staying grounded in very human emotional territory.\" Metacritic also surveyed 46 critics and assessed 40 reviews as positive and six as mixed, assigning an aggregate score of 80 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[114] CinemaScore polled sample audiences, who gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Audience demographics were 54% men and 59% over 35.[115] | Variety reported, \"Critics are calling the film a funny, thrilling ride, and a return to form for [Ridley] Scott after The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings fell flat.\"[116] According to Robert Zubrin, commenting in The Guardian, \"[the film] is the first genuine Mars movie. It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of exploring Mars, as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially either shoot ’em ups or horror films. It does not engage in fantasy: no monsters, no magic, no Nazis. However, there are a number of technical mistakes.\"[117] | Writing for the New York Post, Lou Lumenick considered the film to be Scott's and Damon's best and thought that it is a \"straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of Interstellar.\"[118] Manohla Dargis, of The New York Times, stated that the film, \"involves a dual journey into outer and inner space, a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway, space is the place where he’s physically marooned, but also where his mind is set free\", from a film director, whose \"great, persistent theme is what it means to be human\".[42] Another positive review came from Steve Pulaski of Influx Magazine, who gave the film a B and stated, \"Above all, this is a film destined to please a crowd; in addition, it also keeps its pathos down considerably, doesn't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action, and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story.\"[119] | The Martian was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[120] | 1st – TV Guide | 2nd – Christopher Orr, The Atlantic | 2nd – James Berardinelli, Reelviews | 3rd – Seongyong Cho, RogerEbert.com | 4th – Anne Thompson, IndieWire | 5th – Digital Spy | 5th – Liz Shannon Miller, IndieWire | 6th – Manohla Dargis, The New York Times | 6th – Olly Richards, AskMen | 6th – Rob Hunter, Film School Rejects | 7th – Charles Mudede, The Stranger | 7th – Ty Burr, The Boston Globe | 8th – Lou Lumenick, New York Post | 8th – Mike D'Angelo, The A.V.

Scott was also nominated for Best Director. It received nine nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Visual Effects. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.[123] | The Martian was named Film of the Year by National Board of Review also winning Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Ranked at position eight, it won the Top Ten Films of the year award at African-American Film Critics Association. It received eight nominations from Satellite Awards including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor – Motion Picture, Best Screenplay – Adapted, and Best Visual Effects.[124] | The Martian was named one of the best films of 2015 by over 50 critics and publications and was ranked seventh on Rotten Tomatoes and thirteenth on Metacritic's best scored film of 2015.[120][125] | Solanum watneyi, a species of bush tomato from Australia, has been named after the character of Mark Watney, to honor the fictional heroic botanist portrayal. It is a member of the same genus as the potato, Solanum.[126][127]","m_production":"The Martian was directed by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir's 2011 novel of same name. 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film.[11] The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian.[12] Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film,[13] and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains.[14] Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention.[15] In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut.[16] Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay and the opportunity to work with Scott.[17] Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved.[18] Goddard has since expressed that he felt Scott made a much better film than he could have directed, telling Creative Screenwriting, \"When it's Scott, collaboration is easy because I just revere him. Every day I would just look around and think, 'Is that really Ridley Scott sitting there at the table? This is exciting!'\"[19] | Korda Studios (in Hungarian: Korda Filmstúdió) 26 kilometres (16 mi) west of Budapest, Hungary in the wine-making village of Etyek was chosen for filming interior scenes of The Martian. It was favored for having one of the largest sound stages in the world.[20][21] Filming began in Hungary on November 24, 2014.[22] Scott chose to film The Martian with 3D cameras.[8] Around 20 sets were constructed for the film (where 70 were built for Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) and over 100 for American Gangster (2007)).[21] Actual potatoes were grown in a sound stage next to the one used for filming. They were planted at different times so that different stages of growth could be shown in film scenes.[23] A team of six people built 15 suits for the film. A practical backdrop for Mars was filmed in Wadi Rum, which is a UNESCO world heritage site located in Jordan.[21][24] Wadi Rum had been used as a location for other films set on Mars, including Mission to Mars (2000), Red Planet (2000), and The Last Days on Mars (2013).[25] Filming lasted approximately 70 days.[21] A special Mars rover model was built for the filming; the movie cast and team presented the rover model to Jordan in return for the hospitality they had received. The rover is now exhibited in Jordan's Royal Automobile Museum.[26][27] | Weir avoided writing Watney as lonely and depressed in his novel. While Watney's humor is preserved in the film, Scott also depicted the character's isolation in the vast, dusty Martian landscape. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"The scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity, which is magnificently represented by exteriors shot in the vicinity of Wadi Rum in Jordan.\"[28] Damon said he and Scott were inspired by the 2003 documentary film Touching the Void, which featured trapped mountain climbers.[29] Scott also expected to film Watney as a Robinson Crusoe, a character in full isolation, but learned to film Watney differently since the character would be self-monitoring his behavior under the watch of various mission cameras.[23] | According to Scott, first cut of the movie was 2 hours and 45 minutes long.[30] An extended cut of the movie was released on home video.[31][32] | When the novel was first published, NASA invited Weir to tour the Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When Scott began preparing the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film.[33] When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first production meeting, they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich.[34] NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration.[33] Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration.[34] Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over a period of a month, NASA answered hundreds of questions—on a weekly basis—on everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential \"habs\"—the residences for future Mars astronauts. The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production.[35][36] The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, down to what the computer screens look like, to the production team.[37] Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours.[35][37] The production designers created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as \"the space agency that we all dream of\" and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as \"a run down college campus\".[38] | Newsweek said NASA collaborated more with The Martian than most other films: \"Staff from many NASA departments consulted on the film, from script development through principal photography, and are now helping with marketing timed to the theatrical release.\"[34] As part of the collaboration, the production's NASA liaison included the front page of the script for the film in the payload of the spacecraft Orion during its Exploration Flight Test 1 on December 5, 2014.[39] | The Los Angeles Times said NASA and the wider scientific community anticipated the film as a way to publicize a human mission to Mars. The New York Times reports that the film \"serves as a nice plug for NASA, which has returned the favor by pushing the movie on its website. (On Monday [September 28, 2015], scientists announced that signs of liquid water could be seen in photographs taken on Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,[40][41] timing that suggests NASA certainly has the whole cross-promotion thing down.)\".[42] Jim Erickson, NASA project manager, said the film would show moviegoers \"the risks and rewards\" of humans traveling to Mars.[43] | In October 2015, NASA presented a new web tool to follow Watney's trek across Mars,[44] and details of NASA's next steps, as well as a health hazards report,[45][46] for a real-world human journey to Mars.[47][48][49]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Martian  by Andy Weir","m_directed_by":"Ridley Scott","m_produced_by":"Simon Kinberg | Ridley Scott | Aditya Sood | Michael Schaefer | Mark Huffam","m_screenplay_by":"Drew Goddard","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Matt Damon | Jessica Chastain | Kristen Wiig | Jeff Daniels | Michael Peña | Kate Mara | Sean Bean | Benedict Wong | Donald Glover | Sebastian Stan | Aksel Hennie | Chiwetel Ejiofor","m_music_by":"Harry Gregson-Williams","m_cinematography":"Dariusz Wolski","m_edited_by":"Pietro Scalia","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"September 11, 2015 (2015-09-11) (TIFF) | October 2, 2015 (2015-10-02) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"141 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States[2]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$108 million[3]","m_box_office":"$630.2 million[4] | The Martian is a 2015 American science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon, based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel The Martian. Damon stars as an astronaut who is mistakenly presumed dead and left behind on Mars. The film depicts his struggle to survive and others' efforts to rescue him. The film's ensemble cast also features Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Donald Glover, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. | Producer Simon Kinberg began developing the film after 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately 70 days. Some 20 sets were built on a sound stage in Budapest, Hungary, one of the largest in the world. Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used as a practical backdrop for filming. | The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2015, followed by the United States' theatrical release on October 2, 2015 by 20th Century Fox. The film was released in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX.[5] The film received positive reviews and has grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date, as well as the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2015. It received several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Goddard. Damon won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and was nominated for several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA for Best Actor, and the Critic's Choice Award for Best Actor. |  | ","m_marketing":"20th Century Fox launched a viral marketing campaign for The Martian.[52] On June 7, 2015, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino shared an in-universe video diary depicting Damon's character and the other crew members.[53][54] Ars Technica compared the video diary to similar viral videos marketed for Scott's 2012 film Prometheus in having a similar \"style of slickly produced fictional promotional material\". The studio then released an official trailer on June 8.[55] Forbes said, \"20th Century Fox has cut together a pretty perfect trailer in that it absolutely makes the sale. It establishes the stakes, offers a sympathetic lead character, shows off an all-star cast, tosses out a potential catchphrase, and ends on a grimly humorous tagline.\"[56] In response to the trailer, Jimmy Kimmel, host of the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, released a spoof trailer, The Mastronaut: Emission to Mars, that edited the original to parody the film.[57] | At the start of August, Fox released another video, depicting interviews with each of the main crew members.[58] Mid-month, the studio released another film trailer, and NASA hosted a \"Martian Day\" at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to both promote The Martian and highlight the space program's ongoing efforts to carry out a human mission to Mars.[36] At the end of August, Fox released another video, presenting it as a special episode of the TV show StarTalk in which astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses the hazards of traveling to Mars.[59] In September, Scott's RSA Films released a teaser for The Martian that depicted Damon wearing Under Armour sports clothing and being active in his off-world tasks.[60] The teaser originated from a collaboration between RSA Films and the marketing shop 3AM (under theatrical advertising agency Wild Card), initiated in 2014, to produce advertising content for The Martian. RSA contacted the advertising agency Droga5, under whom Under Armour is a client.[61] Droga5 ultimately collaborated with WME and 3AM to produce the teaser.[60] | Forbes's Peter Himler said American astronauts had traditionally been used by public relations to promote commercial products, starting with the drink Tang. Himler said it \"came as no surprise\" that NASA astronauts in the International Space Station were reported by The Guardian and CBS News as having read Weir's novel and hoping to see the film on board the ISS.[62] NASA participated in the marketing of the film despite its lack of involvement with previous films. Though it turned down a request for Interstellar to be screened on the ISS,[37] The Martian was screened on board[63] 402 km (250 miles) above the Earth's surface on September 19, 2015, and also at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral on October 1, 2015.[37] | In November 2015, 20th Century Fox announced The Martian VR Experience, a \"virtual reality adventure\" where viewers play as Mark Watney and reenact scenes from the film.[64] The project was executively produced by Scott and directed by Robert Stromberg. It is scheduled to be released by the end of 2016 on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Samsung Gear VR.[65]","m_reference":"^ \"The Martian (12A)\". British Board of Film Classification. September 16, 2015.
