It was directed by François Girard, with a screenplay by Girard and Don McKellar. | The film does not present a single narrative, rather a series of thirty-one short films. These include documentaries (five interviews with people who knew him), re-creations of scenes from Gould's life, and various odd items (such as \"Gould Meets McLaren\", in which animated spheres reminiscent of those in Norman McLaren's animations move to Gould's music). The segments range in length from six minutes to less than one minute. | According to Girard: \"As Gould was such a complex character, the biggest problem was to find a way to look at his work and deal with his visions. The film is built of fragments, each one trying to capture an aspect of Gould. There is no way of putting Gould in one box. The film gives the viewer 32 impressions of him. I didn't want to reduce him to one dimension.\"[1] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"The structure and style of the The Simpsons episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" (first aired April 14, 1996), is inspired by this film.
