It is a remake of the 1955 film of the same title, directed by Edvin Laine and based on the best selling Finnish novel by the same name written by Väinö Linna. | Mollberg used young and unknown actors, many of them now famous. The film was shot in color with much hand-held footage, attempting to portray the story more realistically than the prior Edvin Laine version. This has often lead to unfavourable comparisons with the better-known 1955 adaption. Although a full musical score was composed for the movie, Mollberg released the finished film without it for stylistic reasons. | It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.[1] The film was selected as the Finnish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[2] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Festival de Cannes: The Unknown Soldier\". festival-cannes.com.
