{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Robert of Loxley, a simple farmer, is working his land when a fellow Saxon runs through their property attempting to escape Sir Jeffrey and the Royal Game Warden. Robert denies seeing the alleged poacher, and the fight, which ensues, is destined to seal his fate. | When Sir Jeffrey’s brother, Roger of Doncaster, learns that Robert of Loxley was not killed for his insolence, he determines to use the incident to have him arrested and his lands confiscated. Sir Roger’s ulterior motive is that his intended bride Lady Marian Fitzwater has had feelings for Robert from childhood and this stands in the way of his marriage to her. So he enlists the help of the Abbott to have Robert made a Wolfshead: an outlaw whose head is worth that of a wolf’s, dead or alive.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Hough","m_produced_by":"Bill Anderson","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"David Warbeck Ciaran Madden Kathleen Byron David Butler Kenneth Gilbert","m_music_by":"Bernie Sharp Jack Sprague","m_cinematography":"David Holmes","m_edited_by":"Robert C.
