{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Detective Lucas McCarthy (Lance Henriksen) finally catches the serial killer named \"Meat Cleaver Max\" (Brion James) who killed over 100 people and watches his execution. McCarthy and the others watching the execution are shocked to see the electric chair send enough voltage through him to physically burn Max's body before finally dying. Max, however, has made a deal with the devil in order to return from the grave and frame Lucas for a series of grisly murders. He also scares the McCarthy family (who have moved into a new house) and the parapsychologist they hire. Lucas' only hope of stopping Max for good is to destroy his spirit before Max destroys his life and family.","m_cast":"Lance Henriksen as Detective Lucas McCarthy | Brion James as Max Jenke | Rita Taggart as Donna McCarthy | Dedee Pfeiffer as Bonnie McCarthy | Aron Eisenberg as Scott McCarthy | Tom Bray as Peter Campbell | Matt Clark as Dr. Tower","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Isaac David Blyth (fired; uncredited)","m_produced_by":"Sean S.

Although marketed as a sequel to the film House for the non-US market, its connection to the other House films is limited to the crew it shares (producer Sean S. Cunningham, cinematographer Mac Ahlberg and composer Harry Manfredini, among others) and the premise of a killer haunting a house. The third \"true\" House film was named House IV in reference to the existence of this film. A similar movie called Shocker was released in October 1989, when this was released in April 1989. The plot points of both movies are almost identical, including a serial killer, execution via electric chair, and said killer making a deal with the Devil. Shocker later became a cult classic. Kane Hodder was the stunt coordinator on the film. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ J.C. Maçek III (2013-04-26). \"Books of the Dead: The Followers and Clones of 'The Evil Dead'\".
