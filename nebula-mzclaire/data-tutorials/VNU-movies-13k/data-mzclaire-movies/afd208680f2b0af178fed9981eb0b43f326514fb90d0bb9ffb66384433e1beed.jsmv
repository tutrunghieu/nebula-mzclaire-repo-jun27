{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1947, when Aung San Suu Kyi is two years old, her father Aung San leads Burma to independence. But soon afterwards, on 19 July 1947, he along with a group of his colleagues is assassinated by a group of armed men in uniform.[11] As an adult Suu Kyi goes to England, finds a loving husband, and has a happy family life. But in 1988 her mother's poor health forces her to return to Burma where her father, Aung San, is still widely remembered. When she visits her mother in the hospital in 1988, she meets many of the people who were wounded during the Tatmadaw's crackdown in the 8888 Uprising. She realises that political change is needed in Burma and is soon drawn into the movement to promote reform.[12] She accepts the role of icon in support of self-determination by the Burmese people and devotes herself to activities in support of goals of greater political freedoms.[13] Suu Kyi founds a political party and clearly wins the 1990 elections. However, the Burmese military refuse to accept the result of the election and move to bring Suu Kyi under control. She and her family become separated when her husband and children are banned from Burma and she is put under a house arrest for more than a decade.[14] Yet their relentless struggling for Suu Kyi's recognition outside Burma is her guarantee she won't be forgotten and cannot disappear unnoticed. Due to her family's efforts, she becomes the first woman in Asia to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Yet their separation continues because Suu Kyi can neither attend the ceremony nor can her husband Michael Aris see her one last time before his early death.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film received mixed reviews, generally negative in the west, but stronger in the east. English critics often appreciated the efforts of the leading actress, Michelle Yeoh, and the performance of English actor David Thewlis while criticising director/producer Luc Besson. American critics joined the criticism of Luc Besson. In Asia, where people are more familiar with the historical inspiration of the film, the reception was more positive. | Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film 1.5 stars and a rating of 34% (based on 65 reviews), with an average score of 5.2./10[55] | United States | Roger Ebert gave it two and a half stars, citing the strength of Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis' performances but suggesting that Besson should have stayed away from the biopic genre.[56] | Keith Uhlich (Time Out Chicago) described The Lady as a dutifully crafted biopic.[57] | David Rooney (The Hollywood Reporter) praised Thierry Arbogast's cinematography for \"boast(ing) handsome visuals, the South Asian landscapes nicely contrasted with the grey stone structures of Oxford.\"[58] | Asian Week's Annabelle Udo O'Malley evaluated the film as \"certainly worth seeing\" for its \"beautiful cinematography\" and its soundtrack.[59] | Summer J.

She emphasised hereby the scene \"of one of her sons accepting the award on her behalf as she listens to ceremony on a radio thousands of miles away\". She found that scene \"moving\".[61] | United Kingdom | Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called the biopic, 'a pale imitation of an inspirational fighter for democracy.'[62] | Alex von Tunzelmann (The Guardian) criticised historicity, saying that \"accounts of the assassination specifically mention that Aung San was seated and did not even have time to stand before the squad fired 13 bullets into him\".[12] | Australia / Indonesia / Hong Kong | David Stratton (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) said Suu was \"beautifully played by Michelle Yeoh... the epitome of grace and calm\".[63] | Julia Suryakusuma (The Jakarta Post) said she had cried while watching the film.[64] | The University of Hong Kong said that \"the movie provides a context for us to explore the issues of democracy and freedom and the related issues of humanities\" when they announced a screening, inviting Luc Besson, Michelle Yeoh, and Professor Ian Holliday to a post-viewing discussion.[65] | US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton watched The Lady before she met the real Aung San Suu Kyi.[66]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Luc Besson[1]","m_produced_by":"Virginie Besson-Silla Andy Harries Jean Todt","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michelle Yeoh David Thewlis[3] Jonathan Woodhouse","m_music_by":"Éric Serra Sade (band) | Éric Serra","m_cinematography":"Thierry Arbogast","m_edited_by":"Julien Rey","m_production_company":"EuropaCorp Left Bank Pictures France 2 Cinéma","m_distributed_by":"EuropaCorp (France) Entertainment Film Distributors (UK)","m_release_dates":"12 September 2011 (2011-09-12) (TIFF) | 30 November 2011 (2011-11-30) (France) | 30 December 2011 (2011-12-30) (UK) |  | ","m_running_time":"135 minutes","m_country":"France United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"€22.1 million[4]","m_box_office":"$3.7 million[5] | The Lady is a French-British biographical film directed by Luc Besson,[6] starring Michelle Yeoh[7] as Aung San Suu Kyi and David Thewlis[8] as her late husband Michael Aris.[9] Yeoh called the film \"a labour of love\" but also confessed it had felt intimidating for her to play the Nobel laureate.[10] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Third The Lady Trailer\".
