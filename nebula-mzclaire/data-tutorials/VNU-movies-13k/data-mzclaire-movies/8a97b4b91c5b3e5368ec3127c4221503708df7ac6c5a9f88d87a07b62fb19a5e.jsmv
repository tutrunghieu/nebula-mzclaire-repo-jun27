At a charity ball where armed thieves order guests to strip, he is bound nude to Daisy Morgan, a commercial artist.[1] He is immediately attracted to her. | Daisy is in a rather rocky relationship with Marty, a whiny, unstable lawyer who is afraid to make a commitment. Sean does not know she already has a well-off boyfriend, but he decides to play a little trick to win her. With the help of his lawyer, Jay Bass, he pretends to be a poor failure to see if Daisy will love him for himself. As their relationship develops, Sean ultimately decides to reveal his true self. But on that very day, Marty persuades Daisy that he is a changed man and that they should live together in his home. Sean is heartbroken. | On moving day, Daisy accidentally sees a newspaper clipping that reveals Sean's true identity. She demands an explanation, which she accepts, telling him she realized that he is who she truly loves. However, he wonders if she only decided this after reading the article about his success and seeing his Beverly Hills home. She lies. | They elope to Lake Tahoe to be married. On the way, Sean urges her to sign a prenuptial agreement. She thinks it \"unromantic\" but concedes. In a casino in Nevada, gambling by herself, Daisy then miraculously hits a jackpot on a slot machine, winning two million dollars. | Sean returns to say he has had a change of heart and requires no prenup. Now it is Daisy who wants to know when exactly he decided this. She admits lying to him before. Marty shows up and begs her to return to him.
