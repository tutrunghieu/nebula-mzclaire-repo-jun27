{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The OSS now has a full child spy section, of which 13-year-old Carmen Cortez and 10-year-old Juni Cortez have become agents. They face particularly difficult competition with Gary and Gerti Giggles, the children of double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles, whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue in the previous film. It is shown that Carmen defends Gary, and has a crush on him. | After an incident at a local amusement park owned by Dinky Winks where the President's daughter Alexandra deliberately sabotages a thrill ride which juggles its passenger, forcing the Giggles and the Cortez kids to compete in the rescue. Donnagon, who has somehow hacked into the teleprompter which the President was reading from, is named the director of the OSS. Juni is fired after being framed by Gary (who was actually to blame) into losing the \"Transmooker,\" a highly coveted device which can shut off all electronic devices. In his new position as director, Donnagon can carry on with his plan to steal the Transmooker, so he can rule the world. | After Carmen manages to hack into the database, and reinstates Juni's level as an agent. She and Juni use some hints from Alexander Minion, and follow the trail to a mysterious island near Madagascar, which is home to Romero, a lunatic scientist. Romero has been attempting to create genetically-miniaturized animals, so he can make a profit by selling the animals to kids in \"miniature zoos.\" He had an experiment go wrong after accidentally pouring growth concoction onto the mutated set of animals, as a result, he is unwilling to leave his lab, out of fear of being eaten. When Carmen is captured by a Spork, a breed of flying pigs, she meets Gerti, who reveals to her that Gary is actually evil. Carmen changes her feelings for Gary after he tries to kill Juni, and she sides with her brother. Meanwhile, Romero finds out that his creatures are much friendlier than he thought. After fighting pirate skeletons (that came alive after Juni stole a necklace from them), Carmen and Juni, along with the help of their family (who came to the island when they heard their kids were missing), Gerti, Romero and his creatures, destroy the Transmooker, and defeat Donnagon and Gary. Afterwards, Gregorio and Donnagon fight each other, as Gregorio put it, \"the old-fashioned way.\" | Donnagon is fired by the President and his daughter, Gary is temporarily disavowed, and Gregorio is appointed director of the OSS by Alexandra on her father's behalf, while Juni resigns due to the impersonal treatment of agents by the OSS. As the Cortez family leaves the island, Romero gives Juni a miniature spider-monkey as a gift, and all the island's inhabitants bid farewell to the Cortez family. | During the credits, Machete has Carmen sing as an undercover pop star in a concert. Carmen says she can't sing so Machete gives her a mic which auto-tunes her voice, and a belt that helps her dance. He also gives Juni a guitar that plays itself. After the performance, Machete informs Carmen that he did not put the batteries in. As the credits come to a close, Dinky Winks paddles to Romero's island to strike up a business deal.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Arenal Lake, Costa Rica | Austin, Texas, USA | Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA | Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica | San Antonio, Texas, USA | Despite the fact that this film uses over twice the amount of special effects shots than the first film, Rodriguez did not ask the producers for a larger budget; he said[4] \"...I told the studio I don't want more money. I just want to be more creative\".[4] Rodriguez picked some visual effects companies who were eager and less established, as well as starting up his own Troublemaker Studios, and reemploying Hybride, who had worked with him on the first film.[5] Gregor Punchatz, the film's lead animator, employed a certain technique to make the movements of the computer generated creatures resemble the stop-motion work of filmmaker Ray Harryhausen,[4] who has a cameo in the film.[6] The scene with the army of live skeletons was shot on a real rock formation, with the two young actors on safety wires,[7] and the computer generated skeletons added later to over three dozen shots.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Rodriguez","m_produced_by":"Elizabeth Avellan | Robert Rodriguez","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Antonio Banderas | Carla Gugino | Alexa Vega | Daryl Sabara | Mike Judge | Ricardo Montalbán | Holland Taylor | Christopher McDonald | Danny Trejo | Cheech Marin | Steve Buscemi | Taylor Momsen | Matt O'Leary | Emily Osment","m_music_by":"John Debney | Robert Rodriguez","m_cinematography":"Robert Rodriguez","m_edited_by":"Robert Rodriguez","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Miramax Films","m_release_dates":"August 7, 2002 (2002-08-07) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$38 million[2]","m_box_office":"$119.7 million[2] | Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams (credited as Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams onscreen) is a 2002 American science fantasy adventure comedy film written, shot, edited, and directed by Robert Rodriguez, produced by Troublemaker Studios, Elizabeth Avellan, and Rodriguez, and starring Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Mike Judge, Ricardo Montalbán, Holland Taylor, Christopher McDonald, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Momsen, Matt O'Leary, and introducing Emily Osment. | The second installment in the Spy Kids film series, which began with 2001's Spy Kids, the film was theatrically released on August 7, 2002 by Miramax Films and Dimension Films.
