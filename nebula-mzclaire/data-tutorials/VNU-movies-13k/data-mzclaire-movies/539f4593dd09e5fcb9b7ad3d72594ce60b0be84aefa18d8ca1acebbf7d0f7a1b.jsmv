{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Ispahan, Persia, a barber named Hajji Baba (John Derek) is leaving his father's shop to find a great fortune. At the same time the Princess Fawzia (Elaine Stewart) is trying to talk her father into giving her in marriage to Nur-El-Din (Paul Picerni) a prince known far and wide. Her father intends for Fawzia to marry a friend and ally, and makes plans to send her to him. But a courier brings word from Nur-El-Din that an escort awaits Fawzia on the outskirts of the city and she escapes the palace disguised as a boy. Hajji encounters the escort-warrior at the rendezvous spot, is attacked and beats up the escort with his barber's tools. The princess arrives and mistakes Hajji as the escort until he mistakes the emerald ring sent by Nur-El-Din to Fawzia as the prize to be delivered. In her efforts to escape him, her turban becomes unbound and Hajji realizes that the girl herself is the treasure Nur-El-Din awaits. Hajji promises to escort her and they spend the night with the caravan of Osman Aga (Thomas Gomez), who invites them to stay for the dancing girls, among them, the incomparable Ayesha (Rosemarie Bowe). The pair are overtaken by the Caliph's (Donald Randolph) guards sent to bring Fawzia back, but the guards are driven off by an invading army of Turcoman women, a band of fierce and beautiful women who prey on passing merchants.","m_cast":"John Derek as Hajji Baba | Elaine Stewart as Princess Fawzia | Rosemarie Bowe as Ayesha | Amanda Blake as Banah, The Turkamen Leader | Paul Picerni as Nur-El-Din | Donald Randolph as The Caliph | Thomas Gomez as Osman Aga | Pat Sheehan as Handmaiden | Joanne Arnold as Susu | Pat Lawler as Slave Girl | Laurette Luez as Meriam","m_reception":"The film was a hit and made a profit of $673,593.[1]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Hajji Baba  by James Justinian Morier","m_directed_by":"Don Weis","m_produced_by":"Walter Wanger","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Derek Elaine Stewart Thomas Gomez","m_music_by":"Dimitri Tiomkin","m_cinematography":"Harold Lipstein","m_edited_by":"William Austin","m_production_company":"Walter Wanger Productions","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"October 1, 1954 (1954-10-01) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$816,813[1]","m_box_office":"$2,019,100[1] | The Adventures of Hajji Baba is an American film, released on October 1, 1954.
