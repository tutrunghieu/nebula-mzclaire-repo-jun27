{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Investigating an abandoned boat in a New York harbour, a patrolman is killed by a zombie before his partner chases it overboard. The dead patrolman's body is taken to the morgue. Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow) is questioned by police, as the boat belonged to her father. She claims he is conducting research on Matul, a Caribbean island. A newspaper reporter, Peter West (Ian McCulloch), is investigating the story. He and Bowles learn that Bowles' father is suffering from a strange illness on the island. They hire a boat and two guides—Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and his wife Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay)—to reach Matul. | Meanwhile, on Matul, Dr. David Menard (Richard Johnson), and his wife Paola (Olga Karlatos) have been researching the phenomenon of zombie reanimation. Paola wishes to flee the island but Menard insists on staying. That night, Paola is alone in the house when a zombie tries to enter. She pushes the door shut but it breaks through with one arm. Paola is dragged through the hole and killed, with her eye being gouged out by splintered wood. | Approaching Matul, Barrett dives in the ocean around the boat. She encounters a shark and flees behind a reef, only to be accosted by a submerged zombie. Surfacing, she reaches the boat while the shark and zombie attack each other. Eventually, the boat docks at Matul. | Menard is alarmed to find that one of his colleagues has died of the zombie infection; he waits for the body to reanimate before shooting it in the head. While digging a grave for the body, he hears gunfire and follows it to discover the boat group. Menard takes them back to his mansion, discovering Paola's corpse being eaten by zombies. The group fends off an attack and escapes in a jeep, with West suffering an ankle injury when the vehicle veers off-road. Resting in a jungle clearing, the group realise they have encountered a Conquistador-era graveyard; Barrett is killed when one of the corpses rises from the earth and bites out her throat. | As more corpses reanimate, the group flees to a hospital, where Menard explains that the dead are rising as a result of a voodoo curse which he has been trying to stop. The hospital is besieged by zombies, and Menard is killed by one of his former staff. As the zombies attempt to enter, those being treated for infection inside the hospital also reanimate, killing several hospital staff who have stayed behind. As the dead outside breach the door, Bowles sets the building on fire. The undead Barrett attacks Hull but is shot in the head by West. Bowles, West and Hull escape to the boat and leave the island. | At sea, Hull dies of his infection, and his body is locked in a cabin to be used as evidence of what has happened. However, as the boat approaches New York again, a radio broadcast reports that the city is under attack from zombies—the result of the initial attack in the harbour.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Zombi 2 grossed higher in the domestic Italian box office than its predecessor, leading to future sequels—Fulci began directed Zombi 3 before illness forced him to hand over the reigns to Bruno Mattei and Claudio Fragasso, the latter of whom would also direct Zombi 4.[2] | In a contemporary review, Tom Milne reviewed a 89-minute English-language dub in the Monthly Film Bulletin and compared the film to Dawn of the Dead. While noting that the cast was competent and the film featured \"sometimes effective make-up work\", Milne opined that the film \"lacks-for all weaknesses of Romero's film—even a tenth of the minatory charge harboured by Zombies.\"[29] The review noted that the censorship trimmed a \"promisingly gruesome sequence\" with a corpse undergoing an autopsy.[29] In Italy, La Stampa described the film as \"pedestrian\", as well finding it hard to bear Olga Karlatos' character's death scene.[30] | In a 2012 review for The Guardian, Phelim O'Neill described the film as \"the ultimate undead movie\", praising its commitment to gory scenes and convincing effects. O'Neill felt that the film stood the passage of time well, and explained that this was \"because it delivers, plain and simple\". He also highlighted Frizzi's work on the score, and summed the film up as \"a real influence on what followed\".[31] Anne Billson, writing for The Daily Telegraph in 2013, included Zombi 2 in her list of the top ten zombie films, describing its opening scenes as \"sublimely creepy\" and the eye-gouging scene as \"memorably nasty\".[32] Writing for the Daily Mirror, James Kloda praised Fulci's directing, finding that he consistently made evocative use of particular shots to accentuate the film's action or horror. Kloda felt that the film \"can often blind with its shock violence but is well worth the look\".[33] | Writing for AllMovie, Robert Firsching described Zombi 2 as a \"relatively well made shocker\" which \"led to the zombie-gore film becoming the dominant motif of 1980s Italian horror\". Firsching rated the film three stars out of five.[17] Empire's Kim Newman awarded the film two stars out of five, chalking up much of its \"video nasty\" reputation to the \"eye gouging\" scene, comparing this unfavourably to similar material in 1929's Un Chien Andalou. Newman did compliment several sequences as interesting, particularly one underwater scene depicting a zombie attacking a shark, but found that overall the film did no \"keep up the pace or plausability sufficiently\".[34]","m_production":"[Zombi 2] did not have the greatest of scripts but Richard [gave] every scene authority and colour. In the sequence where he was driving me in a Land Rover he extemporised in such a lyrical and poetic fashion that it reminded me of my days with the RSC. | Zombi 2 serves as a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved successful upon its release in Italy.[2] As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis.[3] Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as he didn't feel he would be the right director for a horror film.[4][5] Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.[3] | Screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti had already worked with Fulci on Sette note in nero. Sacchetti has since stated that his initial script for Zombi 2—originally written under the title Nightmare Island—had been influenced by The Island of Doctor Moreau and had been intended to return to \"classic zombie tales\" such as I Walked with a Zombie, The Walking Dead or Voodoo Island.[3] Sacchetti began work on this script in July 1978, before it was optioned by Angelis' company Variety Films that December and re-tooled as Zombi 2.[6] Lead star McCulloch was cast primarily on the success in Italy of the 1975 BBC television series Survivors, which had impressed producer Ugo Tucci.[7] | Production occurred during June and July 1979.[3] Filming took place in Latina, Italy,[1] as well as in New York City and Santo Domingo.[8] Several of the actors' contracts had specified being provided with trailers for the duration of production; however, none were present when filming started and only Johnson was able to convince the producers to provide one. McCulloch and Johnson had known each other for many years by the time they collaborated on Zombi 2, having first met while they were members of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, with the younger McCulloch coming to idolise Johnson's work.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Lucio Fulci","m_produced_by":"Ugo Tucci","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tisa Farrow | Ian McCulloch | Richard Johnson | Al Cliver | Auretta Gay | Olga Karlatos","m_music_by":"Fabio Frizzi","m_cinematography":"Sergio Salvati","m_edited_by":"Vincenzo Tomassi","m_production_company":"Variety Film","m_distributed_by":"Variety Film","m_release_dates":"September 1979 (1979-09) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":null,"m_country":"Italy","m_language":null,"m_budget":"₤410,000,000","m_box_office":"₤3,000,000,000 | Zombi 2 is a 1979 zombie film directed by Lucio Fulci. The film was adapted from an original screenplay by Dardano Sacchetti to serve as a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, released in Italy as Zombi. It stars Tisa Farrow, Ian McCulloch and Richard Johnson, and featured a score by frequent Fulci collaborator Fabio Frizzi. | The film tells the story of a Caribbean island cursed by voodoo, whose dead residents rise as zombies to attack the living.
