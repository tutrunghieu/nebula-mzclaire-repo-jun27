{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The boss of a black market ring (known only as \"The Chief\") wants to smuggle a batch of jewelry from a foreign state into the Soviet Union by hiding it inside the orthopedic cast of a courier. The Chief sends a minor henchman named Gennadiy Kozodoyev (played by Mironov) to serve as the courier. Kozodoyev travels to Istanbul via a tourist cruise ship. The Turkish co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself. Due to a mix-up, they mistake Kozodoyev's fellow passenger from the cruise ship, the \"ordinary Soviet citizen\" Semyon Gorbunkov (played by Nikulin) for the courier. They place a cast around his arm and put the contraband jewels inside the cast. Upon the cruise ship's return to the Soviet Union, Gorbunkov lets the police know what happened, and the police captain, who is working undercover as a taxi driver, uses Gorbunkov as bait to catch the criminals. Most of the plot are various attempts of The Chief's inept henchmen, Kozodoyev and Lyolik (played by Papanov), to lure Gorbunkov into a situation where they can quietly, without a wet job, remove the cast and reclaim the contraband jewels. In the meantime, Gorbunkov's wife begins to suspect that he has either been recruited by foreign intelligence, or is having an affair...","m_cast":"Yuri Nikulin, Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov, an economist at the State Institute for the Planning of Fisheries | Nina Grebeshkova, Nadia, Gorbunkov's wife | Andrei Mironov, Gennadiy Kozodoyev, aka Gesha, a male model, Chief's assistant | Anatoli Papanov, Lyolik, Chief's assistant | Nonna Mordyukova, Varvara Pliushch, upravdom (building superintendent) | Svetlana Svetlichnaya, Anna Sergeyevna, a femme fatale | Stanislav Chekan, Mikhail Ivanovoch, Captain, then Major of militsiya | Vladimir Gulyayev, Volodya, Lieutenant of militsiya | Andrei Fajt, salesman of lottery tickets, visitor of the restaurant \"Weeping willow\" | Nikolay Trofimov, Colonel of militsiya | Nikolay Romanov, Chief of crime gang | Oleksandr Khvylia, Boris Savelyevich, maitre d'hotel of the restaurant \"Weeping willow\" | Tatyana Nikulina, tour guide | Maksim Nikulin, boy with a net (not credited) | Leonid Gaidai, alcoholic (not credited) | Igor Yasulovich, dog owner | Roman Filippov, guest from Syberia | Viktoria Ostrovskaya, prostitute","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Leonid Gaidai","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Yuri Nikulin Nina Grebeshkova Andrei Mironov Anatoli Papanov Nonna Mordyukova","m_music_by":"Aleksandr Zatsepin","m_cinematography":"Igor Chernykh","m_edited_by":"Valentina Yankovskaya","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Mosfilm","m_release_dates":"April 28, 1969","m_running_time":"100 minutes","m_country":"Soviet Union","m_language":"Russian | The Diamond Arm (Russian: Бриллиантовая рука Brilliantovaya ruka) is a 1969 Soviet comedy film filmed by Mosfilm and first released in 1969.
