Hinton], thus leaving the film with a very overdone, contrived feeling.\"[6]","m_production":"The film was rated \"PG\" rather than the \"G\" then customarily earned by Walt Disney Studios productions, and was noted as an early effort by Disney to incorporate more mature subject matter into its films. Tim Hunter, who had previously co-written the 1979 film Over the Edge with Charles Haas, brought the project to Disney and asked for the opportunity to direct it himself. The film was shot entirely on location in and around Tulsa, Oklahoma and its suburbs,[1] the setting of the S. E. Hinton novel on which it is based.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Tex  by S. E.
