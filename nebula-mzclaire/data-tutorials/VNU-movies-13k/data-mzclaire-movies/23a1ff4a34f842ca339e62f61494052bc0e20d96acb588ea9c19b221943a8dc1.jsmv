After Larry accidentally kills Jo's husband during a struggle over a gun, the two are tried for his murder. | Victor Santini is hired to defend Jo by her mother. The lawyer hears her story, of how Mike Morris, her husband, drank and became abusive to her, and how Larry's domineering mother, Mrs. Ellis, resented the affair and demanded that Jo stop seeing her son. | In court, prosecuting attorney Phil Stanley stresses how Jo first told police a prowler had killed her husband until a cufflink belonging to Larry was found at the scene of the crime. Santini uses all his skills to gain a verdict of not guilty, after which, as Jo and Larry are about to leave the courtroom together, Mrs. Ellis calls her son a murderer.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Clifford Odets","m_produced_by":"Jerry Wald","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Rita Hayworth Anthony Franciosa","m_music_by":"Elmer Bernstein","m_cinematography":"James Wong Howe","m_edited_by":"Hugh S.
