{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sean (Dre) and Dee Loc (Snoop) are roommates who have not paid their rent, and their landlord's given them a 3-day eviction notice. | To make matters worse, Sean has just lost his job at Foot Locker due to Dee Loc's interference, so Dee Loc suggests his roommate stop by the same carwash where he works and apply for work there. Sean is immediately hired as assistant manager, with Chris (Eminem) having been fired the day before. | Though Dee Loc has the full amount for the rent (from dealing drugs on the side), he refuses to pay, insisting Sean needs to be responsible, and come up with his half. | Sean does his best to impress Mr. Washington (George Wallace), the owner of the car wash, so he can hold his job long enough to come up with his half of the rent. | At first, things go fine, but then Dee Loc is caught on tape stealing, Mr. Washington tells Sean he must decide what to do, including firing his roommate. | Sean tries to help Dee Loc act more responsible, but this creates friction between them. | Mr. Washington is kidnapped at gunpoint by two clueless and angry local thugs (one of whom is played by DJ Pooh), who call the carwash with their demands, unaware of caller ID, which reveals their location. | Instead of calling police, Sean and Dee Loc put aside their differences long enough to rescue their boss. | The crisis worsens, when former assistant manager, Chris, shows up, wanting revenge on Mr. Washington for firing him. | Chris shoots one of the kidnappers then shoots up the car wash, and runs out of ammunition. Sean attacks Chris, but loses the battle, and falls down. | When all is over, Sean and Dee Loc walk off together.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"DJ Pooh","m_produced_by":"Phillip G.
