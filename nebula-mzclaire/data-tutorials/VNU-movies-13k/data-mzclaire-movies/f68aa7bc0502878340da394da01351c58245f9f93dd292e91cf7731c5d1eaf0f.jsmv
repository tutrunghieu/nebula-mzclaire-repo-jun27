{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"When Wilbur leaves the hospital after having tried once more to kill himself, the staff ask his brother Harbour to let Wilbur move in with him. | The brothers thus share their childhood flat, next door to the bookshop their father left them. | Uninterested in the family business, Wilbur works in a nursery. Harbour takes care of the shop and meets Alice, a mother who sells him the books she finds when working as a cleaner at the hospital. | When she is sacked for always being late at work, she goes to see Harbour to explain why she won't be coming to the bookshop anymore, since she has no books to sell. Following his brother's advice on \"grabbing\" women, Harbour asks Alice to marry him. The wedding meal takes place in an Asian restaurant and allows Wilbur to get acquainted with Sophie, Alice's ex-colleague from the hospital. The two start flirting, but Wilbur pushes Sophie away after she licks his ear. After the meal, Wilbur goes back home and slits his wrists in the bathtub. | Harbour finds his brother just in time and Alice saves Wilbur by using towels to stop the bleeding. While discussing Wilbur with Alice, Harbour ends up telling her his brother feels responsible for their mother's death. | As he is about to leave the hospital, Wilbur gets a nurse named Moira, infatuated with him, to lick his ear. Instead of reciprocating the favor, he wipes his ear and leaves the room. At the same time, a few doors down, Harbour is told by a doctor that he needs to stay in the hospital to get some tests done. Harbour refuses because he wants to be at home with his new family. | Wilbur, Harbour, Alice and Mary live together next to the bookshop, allowing them all to get close to one another. | Before Mary's birthday party, Alice asks Harbour to go and buy whipped cream at the supermarket, where he has a fit. | He wakes up at the hospital, where Dr Horst, a psychologist he has met many times through Wilbur, tries to convince him to get treatment for pancreatic cancer. The two men share a bottle of whiskey, Dr Horst believing that Harbour's liver is in such a state a little alcohol won't make it worse. Wilbur goes back to the bookshop to bring Alice the whipped cream for Mary's party. When a little girl asks him to stand on his head, he throws up on her dress embroidered with gold. Harbour is put to bed; as Wilbur and Alice tidy up after the party, they kiss briefly until she says she can't. | The next day, Wilbur tries to jump off the top of a building but realises he doesn't want to. He goes homes to apologise to Alice for kissing her, but they do it again. | Dr Horst tells Harbour he must explain his very serious situation to his family, but he doesn't know how to. | To fight the mutual attraction he and Alice are experiencing, Wilbur decides to make nurse Moira his girlfriend. One evening as they are all out to dinner, Moira tells them the family they should change their eating habits to make sure Harbour is as healthy as possible during chemotherapy. | Furious at Harbour for wasting time instead of getting treatment, Alice takes him to hospital and spends the night there with him despite Harbour being scared that Wilbur might try to kill himself. The latter, having stayed at home to take care of Mary, decides not to commit suicide when he realises the little girl really does need him. Wilbur even quits his job to replace his brother at the bookshop. Harbour's condition does not improve, so his doctor allows him to spend his last Christmas at the bookshop. | After dinner, as Harbour tucks Mary into bed, she asks him if he is going to spend the night in Wilbur's room, implying that he will be in Alice's. As he is about to take a cab back to the hospital, Harbour asks his brother to take good care of Alice and Mary. In his hospital room, Harbour finishes all his pills and trims his fingernails before lying in bed fully clothed.","m_cast":"Jamie Sives as Wilbur | Adrian Rawlins as Harbour | Shirley Henderson as Alice | Lisa McKinlay as Mary | Mads Mikkelsen as Horst | Julia Davis as Moira | Susan Vidler as Sophie | Jonah Burgess as Steve","m_reception":"The film has been well received by audiences.
