{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Captain Reiker (Curd Jürgens), a Dutch sea captain, sets off on what he intends to be his last slave-ship voyage. After capturing slaves with the complicity of an African chief (Habib Benglia), he then starts his voyage for Cuba. Along with the slaves below-deck, the passengers include his mistress, the slave Aiché (Dorothy Dandridge), and the ship's doctor, Doctor Corot (Jean Servais). Tamango (Alex Cressan), one of the captured men, plans a revolt and tries to persuade Aiché to join him and the other slaves. When the captured slaves do rebel, Tamango manages to hold Aiché hostage. A deadlock between the two sides then develops and Captain Renker states he will fire a cannon into the ships' hold and kill all the slaves unless they give up. Aiché is given a chance to leave by Tamango but after looking up the ladder that leads out of the hold (and towards life), chooses to stay with her fellow slaves. The captain makes good on his threat and shoots the cannon into the hold, literally silencing the slaves' songs.[3][4]","m_cast":"Dorothy Dandridge as Aiché, Reiker's mistress | Curd Jürgens as Captain John Reiker | Jean Servais as Doctor Corot | Alex Cressan as Tamango | Roger Hanin as 1st Mate Bebe | Guy Mairesse as Werner | Clément Harari as Cook | Doudou Babet as Chadi | Habib Benglia as Le chef noir | Pierre Rosso as the diving sailor","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Berry","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dorothy Dandridge Curd Jürgens Alex Cressan Jean Servais","m_music_by":"Joseph Kosma","m_cinematography":"Edmond Séchan","m_edited_by":"Roger Dwyre","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"CEI Incom","m_release_dates":"January 24, 1958 (France) September 16, 1959 (official United States release date)","m_running_time":"98 minutes","m_country":"Italy/France","m_language":"English/French | Tamango is a 1958 French/Italian film directed by John Berry, a black-listed American director who exiled himself to Europe.
