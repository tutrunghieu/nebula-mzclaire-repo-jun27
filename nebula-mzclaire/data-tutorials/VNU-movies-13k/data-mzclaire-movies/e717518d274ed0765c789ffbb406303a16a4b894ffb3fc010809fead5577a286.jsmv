{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1881 in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), the local sheriff and former gunfighter, does not allow guns or criminals in his town. Two cowboys, Quick Mike (David Mucci) and \"Davey-Boy\" Bunting (Rob Campbell), disfigure prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald (Anna Levine), accusing her of stealing, but according to another prostitute, Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher), the real reason was that Delilah \"giggled a little\" at the small size of Quick Mike's penis. Instead of punishing the cowboys, Little Bill allows them to pay compensation to the brothel owner, Skinny Dubois (Anthony James), by delivering five ponies to him the following Spring. The rest of the prostitutes, led by Strawberry Alice, are infuriated by this leniency and offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill the cowboys. | Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny (Clint Eastwood), seeking to recruit him to help kill the cowboys. In his youth, Munny was a bandit notorious as a cold-blooded murderer. Now a repentant widower raising two children, including William Munny Jr (Shane Meier), he has sworn off alcohol and killing. Though Munny initially refuses to help, his farm is failing, putting his children's future in jeopardy. Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid. On his way, Munny recruits his friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), another retired gunfighter. | Back in Wyoming, British-born gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris), an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, is also seeking the reward and arrives in Big Whiskey with a biographer, W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be assassins. The next morning he ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill, who has impressed him with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the gunfighter's psyche. | Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later during a rain storm and head into the saloon/brothel to discover the cowboys' location. With a bad fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him. With no idea of Munny's past, Little Bill beats him and kicks him out of the saloon after finding a pistol on him. Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting advances in kind on their payment from the prostitutes, escape out a back window. The three regroup at a barn outside of town, where they nurse Munny back to health. Delilah also finds them and helps nurture Munny back to health for 3 days. She is very grateful and offers herself to Munny hoping he will take an advance. In a very touching scene Munny explains to her about his love and faithfulness to his dear departed wife, and how they both now share something in common, they both have scars. Munny reveals a soft side to Delilah, and confesses that if he were to want an advance, he would gladly choose her over any of the other girls. | Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting, though Logan and Munny show that they no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan decides to return home while Munny feels they must finish the job. Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him. After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before and renounces life as a gunfighter. When Little Sue (Tara Frederick) meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill's men and tortured to death — but not before revealing Munny's identity. The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny's children and Logan's wife, while an embittered Munny — finishing Logan's bottle of whiskey — returns to town to take revenge on Little Bill. | That night, Munny arrives and sees Logan's corpse displayed in a coffin outside the saloon with a sign reading \"this is what happens to assassins around here\". Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid. Munny walks in alone and kills Dubois. After some tense dialogue, a gunfight ensues, leaving Bill wounded and several of his deputies dead. Bill promises to \"see [Munny] in hell\" before Munny executes him. Munny then threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving Big Whiskey, warning that he will return for more vengeance if Logan is not buried properly or if any of the prostitutes are harmed. A title card epilogue says that Munny moved to San Francisco with his children where he prospered in dry goods.","m_cast":"Clint Eastwood as William \"Will\" Munny | Gene Hackman as \"Little\" Bill Daggett | Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan | Richard Harris as English Bob | Jaimz Woolvett as the Schofield Kid | Saul Rubinek as W.

The film portrays William Munny, an aging outlaw and killer who takes on one more job years after he had turned to farming. A dark Western that deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence and how complicated truths are distorted into simplistic myths about the Old West, it stars Eastwood in the lead role, with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris. Eastwood stated that the film would be his last Western for fear of repeating himself or imitating someone else's work.[3] | Eastwood dedicated the movie to deceased directors and mentors Don Siegel and Sergio Leone. The film won four Academy Awards: Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood, Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman and Best Film Editing for editor Joel Cox. Eastwood was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he lost to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman. The film was the third Western to win the Oscar for Best Picture, following Cimarron (1931) and Dances With Wolves (1990). | In 2004, Unforgiven was added to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"UNFORGIVEN\".
