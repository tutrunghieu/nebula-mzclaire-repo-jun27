Desperate to stay afloat, Abner takes on a new partner, Osborn Tremain (Edmond O'Brien), who has an agenda of his own: to publish a sexy gentleman's magazine, which he can only do by taking over Abner's, since he has been convicted too often of sending obscene material through the mails. | Before the hapless bird-watcher can stop the Tremains, the first issue sells over 40 million copies and Abner becomes the unwilling spokesman for First Amendment rights. Swept up in adulation, the unwitting playboy quickly begins settling into the swinging bachelor lifestyle.","m_cast":"Don Knotts – Abner Audubon Peacock IV | Anne Francis – Lisa LaMonica | Edmond O'Brien – Osborn Tremain | James Gregory – Darrell Evans Hughes | Maureen Arthur – Eleanor Tremain","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Nat Hiken","m_produced_by":"Edward Montagne","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Don Knotts Anne Francis","m_music_by":"Vic Mizzy","m_cinematography":"William Margulies","m_edited_by":"Sam E.
