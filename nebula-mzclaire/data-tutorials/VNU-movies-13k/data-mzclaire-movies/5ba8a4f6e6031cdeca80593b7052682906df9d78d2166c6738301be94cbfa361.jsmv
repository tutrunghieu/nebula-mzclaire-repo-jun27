{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set as flashbacks from the court martial at Greenwich of Commanding Lieutenant William Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) for the loss of HMS Bounty to mutineers led by his friend Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson), during its expedition to Tahiti to gather breadfruit pods for transplantation in the Caribbean. | Bligh sets out from Great Britain in December 1787, electing to sail the Bounty west round the tip of South America in an attempt to use the expedition to fulfill an ambition to circumnavigate the globe. The attempt to round Cape Horn fails due to harsh weather, and the ship is obliged to take the longer eastern route. Finally arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh finds that due to the delays, the wind is against them for a quick return journey and they must stay on the island for four months longer than planned. | During their stay in Tahiti, ship discipline becomes problematic, many of the crew develop a taste for the easy pleasures that island life offers, making the relationship with their Captain tense. Bligh, at the same time, subjects the crew to pressure, eventually reaching breaking point. When the ship leaves Tahiti, Fletcher is forced to leave his native wife, Mauatua, behind. | The resumption of naval discipline on the return voyage turns Bligh into a tyrant not willing to tolerate any disobedience whatsoever, creating an atmosphere of tension and violence. Corporal punishment is meted out for the slightest offence. Bligh insists that the ship is dirty and orders the crew to clean up several times a day. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for tongue-lashings by Bligh. | Playing on Christian's resentment against Bligh's treatment of both him and the men, the more militant members of the crew finally persuade Christian to take control of the ship. Bligh is roused from his bed and arrested, along with those considered loyal to him, and they are forced into a ship's boat, minimally supplied, and cast adrift. The film follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian to get his men beyond the reach of British punishment, and the epic voyage of Bligh to get his loyalists safely to the Dutch East Indies in a longboat. | Bligh, through courage and excellent seamanship, and a return of his good character and leadership qualities, successfully manages to reach civilization after a very harrowing journey without navigational charts nor firearms. One man, however, is killed by natives as the crew stop for supplies on a hostile island. Bligh is portrayed as a man who, on the one hand takes his sense of discipline and command too far, exceeding the limits of the ship's company, but whose character ultimately successfully protects his loyal non-mutineers and guides their overcrowded boat to safety. | The mutineers sail back to Tahiti to collect their wives, girlfriends, and native friends. King Tynah (Wi Kuki Kaa), however, is concerned that their presence on the island could incite King George to declare war against Tahiti and his people. Realizing the folly of staying, they gather supplies and sail away to try to find a safe refuge. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow Mauatua to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father. | The search for a safe haven is long and seemingly impossible, as they realize that any pursuing Royal Navy vessels will search all known islands and coastlines to find them. At this point, those who remained on board the Bounty are so frustrated that they are ready to rebel against Christian to turn the ship back towards Tahiti. After Christian forces the crew to continue on, they eventually find Pitcairn Island, a place which Christian realizes is not marked on British maps of the region. | As the crew of the Bounty burn the ship to keep it from being found (as well as to motivate the crew to tough it out on the island), the judgment of Bligh's court martial is read: Bligh is found to have not been responsible for the loss of the Bounty, and is commended for the voyage of the open boat. Meanwhile, Fletcher Christian and his men realize that they will never go back home to England.","m_cast":"Mel Gibson – master's mate Fletcher Christian | Anthony Hopkins – Lieutenant William Bligh | Laurence Olivier – Admiral Hood | Edward Fox – Captain Greetham | Daniel Day-Lewis – Sailing Master John Fryer | Bernard Hill – Boatswain William Cole | Phil Davis – Midshipman Edward \"Ned\" Young | Liam Neeson – Charles Churchill, Ship's Corporal | Wi Kuki Kaa – King Tynah | Tevaite Vernette (nl) – Mauatua, real name Maimiti (Christian's wife) | Philip Martin Brown – Able Seaman John Adams | Simon Chandler – David Nelson, Botanist | Malcolm Terris – Dr. Thomas Huggan, Ship's Surgeon | Simon Adams – Midshipman Peter Heywood | John Sessions – Steward John Smith | Andrew Wilde – Able Seaman William McCoy | Neil Morrissey – Able Seaman Matthew Quintal | Richard Graham – Gunner's Mate John Mills | Dexter Fletcher – Able Seaman Thomas Ellison | Pete Lee-Wilson – Carpenter William Purcell | Jon Gadsby – Quartermaster John Norton | Brendan Conroy – Robert Lamb, Butcher | Barry Dransfield – Able Seaman Michael Byrne | Jack May - Prosecuting Captain","m_reception":null,"m_production":"This version was originally a longstanding project of director David Lean and his frequent collaborator, Robert Bolt, who worked on it from 1977 until 1980. It was originally to have been released as a two-part film, one named The Lawbreakers that dealt with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second which was to have been named The Long Arm, a study of the journey and the mutineers after the mutiny, as well as the admiralty's response in sending out the frigate HMS Pandora. Lean could not find financial backing for both films after Warner Bros. withdrew from the project; he decided to combine it into one, and even looked at a seven-part TV series, before finally getting backing from Italian magnate Dino De Laurentiis. Unfortunately for Lean, the project suffered a further setback when Bolt suffered a massive stroke and was unable to continue writing; the director felt that Bolt's involvement would be crucial to the film's success. Melvyn Bragg ended up writing a considerable portion of the script. | Lean was ultimately forced to abandon the project after overseeing casting and the construction of the Bounty replica; at the last possible moment, Mel Gibson brought in his friend Roger Donaldson to direct the film, as producer De Laurentiis did not want to lose the millions he had already put into the project over what he thought was as insignificant a person as the director dropping out.[1] | Anthony Hopkins was one of two actors considered for the role of Captain Bligh by David Lean. The other was Oliver Reed. Christopher Reeve, Sting and David Essex were considered for the role of Fletcher Christian. The role of Peter Heywood (who inspired the character 'Roger Byam' in the novel and earlier film versions) was originally intended to be played by Hugh Grant. | The replica of the Bounty used in the film was built in New Zealand before the script was even completed at a cost of $4 million, the entire film cost $25 million. However, unlike many other films filmed on water, The Bounty was finished under budget.[2] As well as the New Zealand–built Bounty, Lean had also looked at refitting the frigate Rose to play the role of Pandora. The latter has since gone on to become HMS Surprise in Peter Weir's Master and Commander. For the storm sequences a detailed 25-foot model of the Bounty was built. | The film was shot on location in Moorea, French Polynesia, New Zealand and at Greenwich Palace and the Reform Club, Pall Mall, London. Many of the shots of the ship were filmed in Opunohu Bay, Moorea, which is the same bay Captain James Cook anchored in, in 1777. | Gibson described the making of the film as difficult because of the long production time and bad weather: \"I went mad. They would hold their breath at night when I went off. One night I had a fight in a bar and the next day they had to shoot only one side of my face because the other was so messed up. If you see the film, you can see the swelling in certain scenes.\" Anthony Hopkins, who had battled with alcoholism until becoming abstinent in 1975, was worried about Gibson's heavy drinking, saying, \"Mel is a wonderful, wonderful fellow with a marvelous future. He's already something of a superstar, but he's in danger of blowing it unless he takes hold of himself.\" Gibson, who likewise self-identified as an alcoholic, agreed with this concern, and added his admiration for the Welsh actor: \"He was terrific. He was good to work with because he was open and he was willing to give. He's a moral man, and you could see this. I think we had the same attitudes.\"[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian  by Richard Hough","m_directed_by":"Roger Donaldson","m_produced_by":"Bernard Williams Dino De Laurentiis","m_screenplay_by":"Robert Bolt","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mel Gibson | Anthony Hopkins | Edward Fox | Laurence Olivier","m_music_by":"Vangelis","m_cinematography":"Arthur Ibbetson, BSC","m_edited_by":"Tony Lawson","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures Corporation Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment","m_release_dates":"4 May 1984 (1984-05-04) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"132 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$25 million","m_box_office":"$8,613,462 | The Bounty is a 1984 British historical drama film directed by Roger Donaldson, starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, and produced by Bernard Williams with Dino De Laurentiis as executive producer.
