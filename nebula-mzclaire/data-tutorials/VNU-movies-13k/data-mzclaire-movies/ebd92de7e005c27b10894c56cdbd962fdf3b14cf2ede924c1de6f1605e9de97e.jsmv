{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the months before the US 2004 presidential election, Mary Mapes (producer of the primetime news program 60 Minutes Wednesday), her crew, and CBS national news anchor Dan Rather face accuracy questions following the airing of a report that President George W. Bush, then seeking re-election, had in the early 1970s received preferential treatment from officials of the Texas Air National Guard. The allegation included concealing Bush's failure to meet even minimal training and performance requirements, and his absence from the Air Guard for most of 1972 following a transfer to the Alabama Air National Guard. | The core documents on which these allegations were based were immediately called into question by a variety of sources. The controversy about the documents being forgeries first appeared on a blog, which was then investigated and amplified by various talk radio hosts, bloggers and numerous mainstream media sources, including The Washington Post and CBS itself. They easily found that certain characteristics of the memos, such as its font and letter spacing, indicated the memos were created on a computer using Microsoft Word, and therefore could not have been typed on a typewriter in the early 1970s.[5] Subsequently, the person who produced the documents admitted that he had lied about where he had obtained them.[6]","m_cast":"Cate Blanchett as Mary Mapes | Robert Redford as Dan Rather | Topher Grace as Mike Smith | Dennis Quaid as Colonel Roger Charles | Elisabeth Moss as Lucy Scott | Bruce Greenwood as Andrew Heyward | David Lyons as Josh Howard | John Benjamin Hickey as Mark Wrolstad | Stacy Keach as Bill Burkett","m_reception":"Truth was well received at the Toronto International Film Festival, where The Hollywood Reporter named it the best film at the festival.[34][35] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Truth has a 62% approval rating based on reviews from 148 critics, with an average rating of 6.2 out of 10. The site's critical consensus states: \"Truth's terrific cast and compelling message are often enough to overcome its occasionally didactic and facile dramatization of a nuanced real-life tale.\"[36] On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[37] Brian Tallerico of Rogerebert.com praised Blanchett and Redford's performances, but said the characters act as mouthpieces for Vanderbilt's political views.[5] | Dan Rather praised Truth noting that, \"there's so much right in the film ... I think it's the best thing that's ever been up on the big screen about how television news really works, the reporting side of it: the telephone calls, wearing out the shoe leather going to see people, developing sources.\" He also commended Redford's portrayal of him as Redford \"did not, which I appreciated very much, try to imitate. He tried to get some essence of me as a person and as a professional.\"[38] | In September 2015, a source close to the film said CBS president and CEO Leslie Moonves did not approve of the film, but did not ask producers for major changes. A source at CBS said it was not planning on publicly condemning the film.[39] In October, Gil Schwartz, the chief spokesman for CBS who is depicted in the film, said \"It's astounding how little truth there is in Truth. There are, in fact, too many distortions, evasions and baseless conspiracy theories to enumerate them all. The film tries to turn gross errors of journalism and judgment into acts of heroism and martyrdom.\"[40] Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News at the time of the incidents and depicted in the film, said he had not seen the film, but knew its story and was outraged at its portrayals, adding that \"only Hollywood could come up with that.\"[41] CBS refused to advertise the film because of the movie's \"inaccuracies and distortions\" which would offend CBS News employees. Some at CBS News are \"angered\" with the film's implication that news executives were pressured to revoke the story by corporate owner Viacom, which \"had business reasons to maintain friendly relations with the Bush administration.\"[42] | In a statement, the film's producers stated, \"Although we understand CBS wants to put this episode behind them, it’s disappointing that they seem to be so concerned about our film...The events depicted in Truth are still vigorously debated, and that’s a good thing\".[40] Brad Fischer, one of the producers, said that a negative response from CBS was not unexpected, but what was surprising is the \"tone and the emotional nature\" of the response. He said that the filmmakers were \"attracted by the intersection of news, politics and business and the story's status as one of the first to be undone by an Internet outcry\" and that he hopes people \"talk about the issues and ask the questions themselves...I don't think it's our job as filmmakers to draw a conclusion, but rather to pose the questions.\"[42]","m_production":"The film is based on Mary Mapes' 2005 memoir Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power. It was produced by Mythology Entertainment.[7][8] The film had been in development since 2007.[9] | In July 2014, it was announced that Robert Redford and Cate Blanchett would portray CBS News anchor Dan Rather and 60 Minutes Wednesday producer Mary Mapes, respectively.[10] In September 2014, Elisabeth Moss joined the cast as CBS associate producer Lucy Scott, and Dennis Quaid was cast as Colonel Roger Charles.[11][12] Topher Grace and John Benjamin Hickey joined the film in October, as researcher Mike Smith, and Mark Wrolstad, Mapes' husband, respectively.[13][14] Bruce Greenwood was cast as Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News.[15] In November, David Lyons was added to the cast as Josh Howard, 60 Minutes executive producer and Mapes' supervisor.[16] It was later reported that Stacy Keach had joined the cast of the film.[17] Mandy Walker is the cinematographer,[18] and Fiona Crombie is production designer.[19] Brian Tyler scored the film.[20] | The film's production budget is more than $9.6 million.[2][21] Principal photography began in October 2014 in Sydney, Australia, with filming scheduled for eight weeks during the Australian spring.[22]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Truth and Duty  by Mary Mapes","m_directed_by":"James Vanderbilt","m_produced_by":"Mikkel Bondesen | Brad Fischer | Doug Mankoff | Brett Ratner | William Sherak | Andy Spaulding | James Vanderbilt","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Cate Blanchett | Robert Redford | Topher Grace | Elisabeth Moss | Bruce Greenwood | Stacy Keach | Dennis Quaid","m_music_by":"Brian Tyler","m_cinematography":"Mandy Walker","m_edited_by":"Richard Francis-Bruce","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Sony Pictures Classics","m_release_dates":"September 12, 2015 (2015-09-12) (TIFF) | October 16, 2015 (2015-10-16) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"125 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$9.6 million[2]","m_box_office":"$5.4 million[3] | Truth is a 2015 American political docudrama film written and directed by James Vanderbilt, in his directorial debut.
