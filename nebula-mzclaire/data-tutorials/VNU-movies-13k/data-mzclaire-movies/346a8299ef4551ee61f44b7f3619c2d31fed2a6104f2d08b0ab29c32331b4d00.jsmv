It went straight to video and stars Christopher Walken, Joan Chen, Anne Heche, and Steven Bauer. | There are three different versions of the film. Cammell committed suicide shortly after seeing it drastically re-edited by its producers.[citation needed] A \"director's cut\" version by Cammell's wife and co-screenwriter China Kong, and his editor and sometime producer Frank Mazzola, was released in 2000 and was noted by critics.[1] The film is perhaps best known for its graphic lesbian love scenes between stars Joan Chen and Anne Heche. The scenes proved controversial to the point that after Wild Side's initial airings on HBO, the network subsequently chose to air a version of the film with those portions deleted.[citation needed]","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Bradshaw, Peter (June 29, 2000). \"Donald Cammell's Wild Side\".
