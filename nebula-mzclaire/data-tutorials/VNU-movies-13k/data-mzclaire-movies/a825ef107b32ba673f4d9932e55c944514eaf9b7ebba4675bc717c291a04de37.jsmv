{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"An assortment of people gather at a countryside inn in preparation for the infamous \"Cannonball Run\", an illegal three-day cross-country race from Washington, D.C. to Santa Monica where the winner and five runners-up will receive $1 million. However, the hot-headed Washington Chief of Police Spiro T. Edsel (Peter Boyle), along with his long-suffering sidekick Whitman (Don Lake), arrests all of the drivers to prevent the race from happening. As a result, sponsors must find replacement drivers by the next day. | Leo Ross (Eugene Levy), seeing that his old school rival, Charlie Cronan (John Candy), has driving skills while working as a parking valet, bullies him into driving his BMW. Ross also persuades Charlie to bring along Tiffany (Donna Dixon), a dimwitted Marilyn Monroe-esque actress. | Vic DeRubis (Joe Flaherty) is a hitman-for-hire sent to kill Alec Stewart (Matt Frewer), an English deadbeat and compulsive gambler who has squandered money that he borrowed from loan sharks. Alec convinces Vic to ride with him, hoping to win the Cannonball Run and pay off the various mobsters. They team up in a Jaguar XJS. | Lee Roberts (Melody Anderson) and Margaret (Shari Belafonte) take over a Ferrari Daytona Spyder after the driver they are trying to woo is arrested. MIT graduates into electronics and gadgets, they are tempted by the prize money and the challenge. | When the driver of the Lamborghini is arrested, a skittish Italian porter named Valentino Rosatti (Brian George) is forced to drive it by Flash (Art Hindle), a former policeman who wants the money for his own reasons. | Nelson and Randolph Van Sloan (Dick Smothers and Tom Smothers), two millionaires and the only drivers not arrested in the police sweep, enter in a Bentley Corniche convertible. They spend most of their time trying to secretly catch a flight to Los Angeles in order to win by foul means. | Following all are a pair of television reporters, Heather Scott (Mimi Kuzyk) and Jack O'Neill (Tim Matheson), who get so caught up in the action that they decide to race their Ford news van. | In hot pursuit is Edsel, who grows increasingly insane in his unsuccessful efforts to stop the racers. Edsel and his men manage to arrest Vic and Alec, who quickly escape and steal the police car. Edsel and Whitman chase after them in their Jaguar. | At the race conclusion, Edsel and Whitman themselves win the Cannonball Run by driving the Jaguar across the finish line at Santa Monica Pier first - saving Alec, because as he points out to Vic; the winner is the car, not the driver - followed by Vic and Alec in their stolen police car. Charlie and Tiffany driving the BMW finish third, Lee and Margaret fourth, Heather and Jack fifth, Flash and Valentino sixth, with the Van Sloan brothers coming in last while riding on roller skis. | The ending credits features the cast playfully driving bumper cars.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film received negative reviews from critics and was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Director, with Brooke Shields winning Worst Supporting Actress. The very brief cameo by Shields has her playing herself, saying that she hopes not to end up being in \"lousy movies\". Chicago film critic Roger Ebert gave the film zero stars in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, stating: | Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel also gave a harsh review to this film - he said \"it is an atrocious excuse for entertainment. If I have a pet peeve about movies is that they are so venal that don't even try to be good. That's Speed Zone.\"","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jim Drake","m_produced_by":"Murray Shostak","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Melody Anderson | Peter Boyle | Donna Dixon | John Candy | Eugene Levy | Tim Matheson | The Smothers Brothers | Shari Belafonte | Joe Flaherty | Matt Frewer | Mimi Kuzyk | Alyssa Milano | Brooke Shields | Carl Lewis","m_music_by":"David Wheatley","m_cinematography":"Michael Condro François Protat","m_edited_by":"Michael Economou","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures","m_release_dates":"April 21, 1989 (1989-04-21) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"90 minutes","m_country":null,"m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$3,007,361 | Speed Zone (also known as Cannonball Fever), released in 1989, is a comedy set around an illegal cross-country race (inspired by the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash). | The film stars many alumni of SCTV, including John Candy, Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty.
