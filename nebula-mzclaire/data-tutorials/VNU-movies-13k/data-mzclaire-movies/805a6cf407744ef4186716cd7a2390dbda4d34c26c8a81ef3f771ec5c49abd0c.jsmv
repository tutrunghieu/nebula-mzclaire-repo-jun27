Since he is about to graduate his mother and a teacher encourage him to apply for college. He finally realizes asking for help with the college applications is a great way for him to get in good with Cinny. So they slowly start a friendship but Greg wants it to blossom into a romance so he begins to lie about things. Things go smoothly and are believable until they fall apart one day.
