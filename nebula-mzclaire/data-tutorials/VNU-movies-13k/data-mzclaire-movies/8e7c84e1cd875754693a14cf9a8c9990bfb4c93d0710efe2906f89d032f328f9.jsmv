{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A ghostly execution of world mastermind criminal Fu Manchu is witnessed by nemesis Nayland Smith. Back in England, however, it is increasingly apparent that Fu Manchu is still operating. Smith is quick to detect that the execution he witnessed was that of a double, an actor hypnotised into taking Fu Manchu's place. The villain is back in London, working from a secret base underneath the River Thames. He has kidnapped the esteemed Professor Muller, who holds the key to a potentially deadly solution from the seeds of a rare Tibetan flower.","m_cast":"Nigel Green as Sir Denis Nayland Smith | Tsai Chin as Lin Tang | Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu | Joachim Fuchsberger as Carl Jannsen | Karin Dor as Maria Muller | James Robertson Justice as Sir Charles | Howard Marion-Crawford as Dr. Petrie | Walter Rilla as Professor Muller | Harry Brogan as Professor Gaskell | Jim Norton as Mathius | Archie O'Sullivan as Chamberlain | Edwin Richfield as Chief Magistrate | Joe Lynch as Custodian | Ric Young as Grand Lama | Jack O'Reilly as Police Constable | Kevin Flood as Policeman on Traffic duty | John Franklin as Morgue Attendant | Derek Young as Official at Village | Peter Mosbacher as Hanumon | Poulet Tu as Lotus | Deborah DeLacey as Slave Girl | Peter Mayock as British Soldier No. 1 at Fleetwick | Aiden Grennel as Security Guard | Ray Macklin as British Soldier No. 2 at Fleetwick | Conor Evans as Police Officer on boat at Thames River (calling out to Nayland Smith)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Producer Harry Alan Towers denied the films were made to cash in on the James Bond craze: | No relationship. Action, adventure, open-air, escapism - yes - but nothing to do with Bond-ism - Fu Manchu's atmosphere is a kind of timeless Never Never land. Bond is gimmicky and with-it.[2] | The film was shot on location in Ireland. Towers: | It's a good country for location work; the British quota helps; on costs, there is not much difference between making a film here and in Britain - both sets of unions see to that. Ardmore? It seems to be doing alright with the present film - and Ireland will always be attractive as long as filmmakers and their artists are seeking refuge from super tax.[2] | The prison sequences were shot at Kilmainham Gaol.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Don Sharp","m_produced_by":"Harry Alan Towers Oliver A.
