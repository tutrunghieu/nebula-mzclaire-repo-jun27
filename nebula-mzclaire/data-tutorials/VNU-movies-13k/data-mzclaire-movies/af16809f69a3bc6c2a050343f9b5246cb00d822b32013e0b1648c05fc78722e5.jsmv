{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During the Black Death of 14th century England, people in a remote Cumbrian mountain village listen with fear to tales of the gruesome plague that has engulfed the world. In an attempt to stave off the infection, they rely upon the visions of a boy, named Griffin, who has a reputation for having a kind of \"second sight\". With the backing of the village's most famous adventurer, a man named Connor, whom Griffin idolizes, a group of the townsfolk travel to a nearby cavern. Bringing good copper ore to be melted and cast into shape, they dig down into the earth, all the while racing against time and the coming of the next full moon, in an effort to place a holy cross on the steeple of \"the biggest Church in all of Christendom\" as an offering for God's protection. | As the full moon is rising, the villagers break though into a smooth-lined tunnel, and then, finding a ladder, climb up and into late twentieth century New Zealand. Up until this point, the film has been shown in black and white. Now the adventure continues in colour film. The villagers marvel at the various technologies, never questioning what year it might be, believing that such things are only natural in great cities. But Griffin is haunted by a dark vision as the villagers come closer to fulfilling their quest.","m_cast":"Bruce Lyons as Connor | Chris Haywood as Arno | Hamish McFarlane as Griffin | Marshall Napier as Searle | Noel Appleby as Ulf | Paul Livingston as Martin | Sarah Peirse as Linnet | Mark Wheatley as Tog 1 | Tony Herbert as Tog 2 | Jessica Cardiff-Smith as Esme | Roy Wesney as Grandpa | Kathleen-Elizabeth Kelly as Grandma | Jay Saussey as Griffin's girlfriend | Charles Walker as Old Chrissie | Desmond Kelly as Smithy | Bill Le Marquand as Tom | Jay Laga'aia as Jay | Norman Fairley as Submarine captain | Alistair Babbage as Grigor | Barron Christian as American Submarine Captain","m_reception":"The Navigator was officially chosen for competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival,[22] and although it won no awards it received a five-minute standing ovation.[16] Caryn James of the New York Times described the film as \"a dark, thrilling fantasy that places Mr. Ward... among the most innovative and authoritative young film makers\", and gave it four and half out of five stars.[23] On Rotten Tomatoes the film received an 80% rating, based on five reviews.[24] | Fantafestival, Rome: Jury Prize, Best Film.[25] | Cinema Fantastic, Sitges Film Festival, Spain: Best Film.[26] | International Festival of Fantasy Films, Munich: Best Film. | Australian Film Institute Awards: Best Film, Best Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design. | Fantasporto, Portugal: Best Film (1989) | New Zealand Film and Television Awards: Best Film, Best Male Performance (Hamish McFarlane), Best Female Performance in a Supporting Role (Sarah Peirse), Best Male Performance in a Supporting Role (Noel Appleby), Best Cinematography, Best Soundtrack, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Film Score, Best Original Screenplay, Best Production Design.[16]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Vincent Ward","m_produced_by":"John Maynard","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Chris Haywood Marshall Napier Paul Livingston Jay Laga'aia","m_music_by":"Davood A.
