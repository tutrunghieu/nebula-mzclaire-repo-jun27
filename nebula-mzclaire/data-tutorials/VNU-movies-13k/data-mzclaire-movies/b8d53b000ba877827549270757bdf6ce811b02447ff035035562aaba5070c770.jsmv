Such foreknowledge is reassuring and very much a part of the pleasure of weeper movies. ...Knowing the kind of movie he wanted to make, Mr. Peerce has worked with a singleminded purpose to achieve it. He has an extremely pretty, efficient young actress named Marilyn Hassett to play Jill, and he has Beau Bridges to play the daredevil of a fellow—skier, motorcyclist, sky diver—who loves Jill through thick and thin. In a film like this, Mr. Bridges's appearance is the sort of certificate of honor the audience looks for. ... There are some beautiful ski scenes and some terrifying scenes in the hospital. The movie also contains a couple of moments of genuine feeling—all set in a Los Angeles center for the rehabilitation of the handicapped—that raise the over-all tone. Mostly, though, the inspiration one detects in The Other Side of the Mountain is the inspiration to make the kind of prefabricated romantic movie that every few years turns the American public into a bunch of blubbering idiots.\"[4]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"A Long Way Up  by E.G.
