{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) works for a HR consultancy firm which specialises in termination assistance, and makes his living travelling to workplaces across the United States in order to conduct company layoffs and firings on behalf of employers. Ryan also delivers motivational speeches, using the analogy \"What's In Your Backpack?\" to extoll the virtues of a life free of burdensome relationships with people as well as things. Ryan relishes his perpetual travels. His personal ambition is to become only the seventh person to earn ten million frequent flyer miles with American Airlines. While traveling, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex (Vera Farmiga) and they begin a casual relationship. | Ryan is unexpectedly called back to his company's offices in Omaha, Nebraska. An ambitious, freshly-graduated new hire, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is promoting a plan to cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan argues that Natalie knows nothing about the actual process, live or not, and does not know how to handle upset people. He plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. His boss (Jason Bateman) assigns him to take Natalie with him on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes, much to his annoyance. | As they travel together and become better acquainted, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophy, but he is satisfied with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message. Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterwards they are both ordered back to Omaha to begin implementing Natalie's program. There are problems during a test run; one laid off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and she is unable to comfort him. | Instead of returning immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex to accompany him to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a honeymoon trip. When the groom gets cold feet, Ryan’s older sister talks him into using his motivational skills to persuade him to go through with it. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches. | Ryan begins having second thoughts about his own life. As he starts to deliver his \"What's In Your Backpack?\" speech at a convention in Las Vegas, he realizes he no longer believes it, and walks off the stage. On an impulse, he flies to Alex's home in Chicago. When she opens the door, he is stunned to discover she is a married woman with children; Ryan leaves without a word before her husband can suspect anything. She later tells him on the phone that her family is her real life and he is simply an escape. Again, he ends the conversation wordless. | On his flight home, the crew announces that Ryan has just crossed the ten million mile mark. The airline's chief pilot (Sam Elliott) comes out of the cockpit to meet Ryan. He notes that Ryan is the youngest person to reach the milestone. When asked where he is from, Ryan can only respond \"here\". | Back in his office, Ryan calls the airline to transfer five hundred thousand miles each to his sister and brother-in-law, enough for them to fly around the world for their honeymoon. His boss tells Ryan that a woman he and Natalie fired has killed herself, and that an upset Natalie has quit via text message. The company also puts the remote-layoff program on hold because of related concerns. | Natalie applies for a job in San Francisco, the city she was originally offered a job before following her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha instead. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her. The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage.","m_cast":"George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, \"a suave, smartly dressed businessman in his 40s\"[4][5] | Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran, a 34-year-old constantly traveling businesswoman[5] | Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, an ambitious 23-year-old | Jason Bateman as Craig Gregory, owner of Career Transition Counseling | Amy Morton as Kara Bingham, Ryan's older sister | Melanie Lynskey as Julie Bingham, Ryan's younger sister | Danny McBride as Jim Miller, Julie's fiancé | Zach Galifianakis as Steve, a fired employee | J.

The critical consensus reads, \"Led by charismatic performances by its three leads, director Jason Reitman delivers a smart blend of humor and emotion with just enough edge for mainstream audiences.\"[124] On Metacritic, the film has a rating score of 83 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[126] | The sneak preview of Up in the Air was the highest profile hit during the Telluride film festival.[127] The film also tied for third place in the Toronto International Film Festival Indiewire poll.[128] | Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Up in the Air makes it look easy. Not just in its casual and apparently effortless excellence, but in its ability to blend entertainment and insight, comedy and poignancy, even drama and reality, things that are difficult by themselves but a whole lot harder in combination. This film does all that and never seems to break a sweat.\"[129] Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman agreed, rating the film an A as a \"rare and sparkling gem of a movie, directed by Jason Reitman with the polish of a master.\"[130] | Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the film's sense of timeliness, writing, \"It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity... Reitman emerges as a modern-day Frank Capra, capturing the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience.\"[131] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, \"It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films.\"[132] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, \"Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for.\"[133] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, \"This isn't a comedy. If it were, it would be hard to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job.\"[134] | Calling the film \"a slickly engaging piece of lightweight existentialism,\" Todd McCarthy wrote in Variety that \"Clooney owns his role in the way first-rate film stars can, so infusing the character with his own persona that everything he does seems natural and right. The timing in the Clooney-Farmiga scenes is like splendid tennis.\"[123] The New York Times' Manohla Dargis especially appreciated the film's strong female roles, noting that \"the ferocious Ms. Kendrick, her ponytail swinging like an ax, grabs every scene she's in,\" but wrote that the film \"is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama... and the mope rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses.\"[135] | The Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips wrote, \"Up in the Air is a slickly crafted disappointment. [It] feels tailor-made for George Clooney, who is very good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns to be a little less the man he was.\"[136] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, \"There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying.\"[137] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, \"Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... [the film] warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can.\"[138] | Shave Magazine's Jake Tomlinson gave the film four out of five stars and wrote, \"There is a very strong sense of humor as well as emotional depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments. As a moviegoer, this film provides a satisfying experience where one can take a step back to ponder some of the finer points in our daily lives, but don't expect to find all the answers here.\"[139] | Up in the Air earned various awards and nominations, in categories ranging from recognition of the film itself to its screenplay, direction and editing, to the performance of the three primary actors – George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick. The film received six Academy Award nominations and Farmiga and Kendrick both received nominations for Best Supporting Actress, although the film failed to win any of the awards.[140][141] At the 63rd British Academy Film Awards, Up in the Air won one award – Best Adapted Screenplay, awarded to Reitman and Turner – out of the five for which it was nominated.[142] The Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association named Up in the Air Best Picture and awarded Reitman Best Director and Best Screenplay with Turner, and Clooney was given the award for Best Actor.[143][144] The film also received five nominations at the 67th Golden Globe Awards, with Reitman and Turner taking the award for Best Screenplay.[145][146] Reitman and Turner also received recognition for the film's screenplay from the Writers Guild of America, where they won the Best Adapted Screenplay award.[147] | The film garnered five nominations from the Satellite Awards, with Rolfe Kent, the film's score composer, winning the Best Original Score award.[148] Clooney, Farmiga and Kendrick were each nominated for an award at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards, but ultimately lost out.[149][150] Kendrick earned an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance[151] and the Rising Star Award from Palm Springs International Film Festival for her role in the film.[152] Up in the Air won Best Film from eleven awards ceremonies, including the Florida Film Critics Circle, Iowa Film Critics, Southeastern Film Critics, and Vancouver Film Critics Circle.[153][154][155][156] The film earned four nominations for the Best Cast from the Broadcast Film Critics Association,[157] Central Ohio Film Critics,[158][159] Denver Film Critics Society,[160] and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association.[161] At the Kansas City Film Critics Circle and the National Board of Review, Up in the Air won each of the awards for which it was nominated.[162][163] Costume Designer Danny Glicker was nominated for his work by the Costume Designers Guild in the Contemporary Film category.[164] In addition, the film was included on lists of the ten best films of 2009 by Roger Ebert, the American Film Institute, and The New York Times.[165][166][167]","m_production":"Walter Kirn wrote Up in the Air, the book on which the film is based, during a snowbound winter on a ranch in rural Montana, while thinking about airports, airplanes and first-class passengers he had met who would strongly resemble Ryan Bingham.[9] The novel was published in 2001 and, shortly after, Sheldon Turner discovered the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003.[10] | Canadian-American filmmaker Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the Christopher Buckley blurb on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup.[11][12] Reitman persuaded his father, Canadian-American filmmaker Ivan Reitman, to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted Griffin and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some Turner inventions that were used in the film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech (\"Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now...\"), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).[12][13] Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, then later admitted to confusion when the Writers Guild of America ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit, after Turner's contribution to the final product was made clear.[12][13] At a press screening, Reitman also said that his father Ivan had written \"the best line in the movie.\"[14] | Though Reitman has claimed in countless interviews that he wrote the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis,[15][16] some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played.[17] On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk a fine line between aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, \"If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes.\"[18] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin \"his Lost in Translation.\"[19][20] | Approximately 4,600 people applied to be extras in the film during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009, at Crestwood Court in St. Louis, Missouri.[21] Up in the Air cast 2,000 extras[22] with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor speaking roles. About 250 extras were used from the Omaha, Nebraska, area. They were used for filming inside and outside the terminal at Eppley Airfield, while Clooney acted out most of his scenes inside the terminal.[23] | While filming in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman placed an ad in the paper asking if people who recently lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified \"documentary\" in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been.[24] The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis).[25] Twenty-two are seen in the film.[26] The interviews ran for about ten minutes on what it is like to lose their job in this poor economy, and after that they would \"fire\" them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.[9][27][28] | Filming was mostly done in the St. Louis area. Several scenes were filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals at Detroit Metro Airport in late February 2009 with minimal filming in Omaha, in Las Vegas and in Miami, Florida.[29][30][31][32] Missouri and St. Louis leaders provided $4.1 million in tax credits for the $25 million film.[33] Producers set up a St. Louis, Missouri production office on January 5, 2009.[34] Filming began in St. Louis on March 3, 2009, and continued through the end of April.[21] The film includes 80 different sets at 50 locations throughout the St. Louis area, including Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Concourse C and Concourse D[34][35] (which played the part of several airports across America), the Mansion House apartments in downtown St. Louis,[22] Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark, Hilton St. Louis Airport,[36] the Cheshire Inn, the GenAmerica building, Renaissance Grand Hotel, Maplewood United Methodist Church, and Affton High School.[37] The film was shot at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for five days, twenty hours each day.[38] | In October 2008, Production Services of Omaha scouted locations in Omaha, Nebraska for three days of filming in late April with Clooney.[39][40][41] Some of the scenes were shot inside the Visitor's Bureau and in a condo in the Old Market area of downtown Omaha and at the south end of the main terminal at Eppley Airfield.[23][42] | Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, eight of which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out to be more difficult than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.[15][16] | The film features heavy product placement, with American Airlines,[43] Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels[43] all featured prominently.[44][45] Competing brands are displayed as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms in dialogue. However, the brands did not pay for the exposure; rather, they waived the fees for the producers to shoot on location, such as at AA's airport areas and inside Hilton hotels.[46] Reitman expressed his desire to use actual brands as he finds them less distracting.[46] | The post-production schedule for Up in the Air was shorter than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman was involved in post-production while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them. He flew home every weekend to work with her for a few hours on Saturday or Sunday in order to stay on schedule.[47] | Editing helped determine how nonverbal moments shape the first meeting between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. \"In a scene like that, there is a sort of playfulness that goes on,\" editor, Dana E. Glauberman said. \"There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after.\"[48]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Up in the Air  by Walter Kirn","m_directed_by":"Jason Reitman","m_produced_by":"Daniel Dubiecki | Jeffrey Clifford | Ivan Reitman | Jason Reitman","m_screenplay_by":"Jason Reitman | Sheldon Turner","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"George Clooney | Vera Farmiga | Anna Kendrick","m_music_by":"Rolfe Kent","m_cinematography":"Eric Steelberg","m_edited_by":"Dana E.

It is a film adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name, written by Walter Kirn. The story is centered on corporate \"downsizer\" Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) and his travels. The film follows his isolated life and philosophies and the people he meets along the way. Filming was primarily in St. Louis, Missouri, which substituted for a number of other cities. Several scenes were filmed in Detroit, Omaha, Nebraska, Las Vegas, and Miami. | Reitman promoted Up in the Air with personal appearances at film festivals and other showings, starting with the Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2009. The Los Angeles premiere was at the Mann Village Theater on Monday, November 30, 2009. Paramount scheduled a limited North American release on December 4, 2009, broadening the release on December 11, 2009, with a wide release on December 23, 2009. | The National Board of Review and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association named Up in the Air the Best Picture of 2009. It received eight Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations and garnered a win for Adapted Screenplay, six Golden Globe nominations, earning a win for Best Screenplay, and three Screen Actors Guild nominations. It received six Academy Award nominations, but did not win in any category. Up in the Air also received recognition from numerous critics' associations. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Abramowitz, Rachel (November 29, 2009). \"Jason Reitman firmly at the controls in 'Up in the Air'\".
