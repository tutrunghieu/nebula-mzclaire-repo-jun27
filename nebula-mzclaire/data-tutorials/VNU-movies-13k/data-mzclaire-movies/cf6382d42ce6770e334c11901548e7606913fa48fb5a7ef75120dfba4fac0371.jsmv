{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"College students Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) spend their time partying while their friend Faith (Selena Gomez) attends a religious youth group. As their classmates head to spring break, they are stuck behind due to a lack of money. Desperate to make the trip, Brit and Candy, after getting high on cocaine, don ski masks and use hammers and realistic-looking squirt guns to rob a local restaurant. Cotty drives and later burns a getaway car stolen from one of their professors. | In St. Petersburg, Florida, the girls attend wild beach parties fueled by alcohol, drugs and sex. Cotty, Candy and Brit divulge the details of their crime to a horrified Faith, who keeps quiet about it. After a particularly wild party, all four are arrested. They spend the night in a holding cell, but are bailed out by Alien (James Franco), a local rapper and gangster. Alien charms Cotty, Candy and Brit with his wealth and \"bad boy\" swagger, but Faith feels uneasy. | Alien takes the girls to a local club frequented by gang members, where Faith becomes even more uncomfortable with his lifestyle. Despite Alien's attempts to convince her to stay, Faith decides to leave and begs the others to come with her. They refuse, however, and she makes the trip home alone. Alien takes Brit and Candy to a strip club owned by his rival, Big Arch (Gucci Mane), who warns Alien to stop selling drugs in his territory. The girls return to Alien's mansion, where he flaunts his drug money and cache of weapons, describing his life as the \"American Dream\". Brit and Candy suddenly grab one of his guns and threaten to kill him; turned on, Alien performs fellatio on the gun and declares that he has fallen in love with the girls. | Alien arms the girls with pink ski masks and shotguns, and they perform several armed robberies. While in Alien's car they are approached by Big Arch and another member of his gang, who threaten them and execute a drive-by shooting, wounding Cotty. Alien promises to retaliate, but a traumatized Cotty chooses to return home. Brit and Candy stay behind and begin a sexual relationship with Alien. The three of them decide to take revenge on Big Arch. In a flashforward, the two girls call home, promising to work harder and become better people. | Back in the present, the three travel in a motorboat to Big Arch's mansion. After docking at the pier, Alien is immediately shot and killed by one of Big Arch's guards. Brit and Candy continue on, killing Big Arch's gang before confronting and killing Big Arch himself. During the assault and its aftermath, the camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while Faith speaks in a voice-over, first heard earlier in the film, describing the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they truly are. Brit and Candy drive home in Big Arch's Lamborghini. A final flashback shows the pair kissing Alien's dead body.","m_cast":"James Franco as Alien | Vanessa Hudgens as Candy | Ashley Benson as Brit | Selena Gomez as Faith | Rachel Korine as Cotty | Gucci Mane as Big Arch | Heather Morris as Bess | Jeff Jarrett as Youth Pastor | Russell Stuart as DJ | ATL twins as Themselves","m_reception":"The film received generally favorable reactions from critics.

Area Film Critics Association nominated Franco for its Best Supporting Actor award.[57] | ","m_production":"According to Harmony Korine, he wrote the film partially to make up for his own spring breaks, as he had been fully devoted to skateboarding, and therefore missed out on what he saw as opportunities for hedonistic pursuits.[19] Korine has referred to the film as a \"beach noir\".[18] The original lineup of lead actresses was announced as Emma Roberts, Selena Gomez, and Vanessa Hudgens.[20] Roberts however dropped out in early 2012, reportedly after hearing she would need to gain body fat for her role.[21] Director Korine had purposely collected a group of well-known young actresses with a similar reputation to Roberts in Hollywood.[22] Ashley Benson was ultimately cast.[23] The film was shot in March and April 2012 in and around St. Petersburg, Florida.[19] Skrillex produced the film's score.[24]","m_sequel":"Spring Breakers: The Second Coming was announced in May 6, 2014.

It stars James Franco, Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine and follows four college-aged girls on their spring break in Florida where they meet an eccentric local drug dealer named Alien who helps them in a time of desperation, and their eventual descent into a world of drugs, crime, and violence.[6][7][8][9][10] | Korine had devised the concept for Spring Breakers over several years prior to production, with fleeting ideas about the plot and what should transpire. His initial desire was to create a \"sensory film\" that was more about feeling than action and placed little importance on narrative or plot, the idea for which came later.[11] Once Korine developed the backbone of the story, which takes place around the American spring break period, he travelled to Florida to write the screenplay. Production began in 2012, on an estimated budget of $5 million–a relatively small amount in today's film industry, albeit Korine's second most expensive film to date. The film is also one of Korine's first theatrical works to receive a wide release.[12] | Spring Breakers was released on March 22, 2013 by A24 and grossed $31 million worldwide, making it a resounding success considering the small budget. It received generally positive reviews from film critics, with some calling it a potential cult classic.[13][14][15][16] The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival.[17] Critics and scholars have read deeper meaning in the film's plot, commenting on its reflection of modern day superficiality and the younger generation's obsession with highly stylised pop culture media.[18] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Cruz, Niki (February 14, 2013). \"'Spring Breakers' Gets An Early Release Date\".
