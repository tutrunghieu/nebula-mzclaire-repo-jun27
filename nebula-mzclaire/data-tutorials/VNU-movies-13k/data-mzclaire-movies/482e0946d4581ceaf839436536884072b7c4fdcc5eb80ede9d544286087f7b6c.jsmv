It received the Dove Seal of Approval for the family audience. Dove said “ This is a comical musical about a group of young singers and dancers as they try to make their dreams come true. It’s an upbeat film geared towards the tween set.”[10] Roger Moore in Paradise Post said “Director Stewart Raffill (The New Swiss Family Robinson) is an old pro who at least makes the laughs work.”[11] Scholastic News Magazine Kids Press Corps said “Standing Ovation is a rocking and colorful movie about musical competitions, friendship, loyalty, and dreams—BIG DREAMS!“[12] | However, the movie was heavily panned by mainstream critics. Joe Leydon of Variety Magazinecalled it “at once annoyingly hyper and underwhelmingly dull.”[13] Rotten Tomatoes has an audience score of 47% that liked it; 6% on the Tomatometer and reports no consensus.[14] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said \"Standing Ovation is an innovative film in the sense that every minute or so it comes up with a different way of being annoying.\"[15] Though Gary Thompson of Philadelphia Daily News said \"Standing Ovation will have its work cut out for it at the viciously competitive box office, but the film may serve as a springboard for the eager and able talent on display.”[16] It has a score of 22 on Metacritic by the critics but a user score with mixed and average reviews.[17] Last Airbender and Standing Ovation appear on the Worst of 2010 movie list by Ain’t It Cool News.[18] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said that he “had never heard of the people in Standing Ovation and I hope to never hear of any of them again.”[19] | Some critics have claimed, despite the negative reviews, that the film's cast was considered a stand-out. Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer said “the cast is full of fresh-faced unknowns ready for their close-ups. Most likely to succeed is Kayla Jackson, an almond-eyed dreamer.” [20] William Bibbiani of Geekscape says “Standing Ovation is film that received a small theatrical run in the middle of the summer. You were probably too busy watching Inception to notice. The film was written and directed by Stewart Raffill, who also helmed the wonderful 1980s sci-fi action romp The Ice Pirates, and features a cast of dozens of youngsters competing in a music video contest...\" \"...in theaters around the country audiences are slowly beginning to discover Standing Ovation, one of the must-see movies of the year.”[21] | “Call it Junior High School Musical” Rachel Smith On the Red Carpet KABC-TV [22] | Jack Fitcher of the Cape May County Herald said “The movie is rich in dance numbers set to music that will be loved by teens and pre-teens which is the target audience. Even though this reporter is about 30 years older than the targeted demographic, I got caught up in the plot and enjoyed seeing so much local talent on the screen.” [23] “It has been called a history making tween musical movie; a combination of high energy of High School Musical and the pace of A Minute To Win It.” The Punch Bahamas Newspaper | On August 20, 2015, the website Crave Online declared the film the 37th Worst Movie of the Decade (So Far). [24] | The film was a box office bomb. According to Box Office Mojo, the film had a limited release and earned a gross of $531,806 in the United States.[25]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stewart Raffill","m_produced_by":"Diane Kirman | James Brolin | Suzanne Nunez | William Lewis | Mario Macaluso | Gary Tex Brockette | Al Sapienza | Art Smith Jr. | Jennifer Tini | Jim Walsh","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Kayla Jackson | Alanna Palombo | Alexis Biesiada | Najee Wilson | Pilar Martin | Kayla Raparelli | Austin Powell | Erika Corvette | Sal Dupree | Joei DeCarlo","m_music_by":"Benedikt Brydern","m_cinematography":"Jon Darbonne","m_edited_by":"Laurie McDowell","m_production_company":"Kenilworth Film Productions","m_distributed_by":"Rocky Mountain Pictures","m_release_dates":"July 16, 2010 (2010-07-16) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"106 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$5.6 million","m_box_office":"$550,418 | Standing Ovation is a musical film written and directed by Stewart Raffill.
