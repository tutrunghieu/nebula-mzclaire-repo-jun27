{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On the West Side in the summer of 1957, there is tension between the Jets (led by Riff) and the Sharks, led by Bernardo. Lieutenant Schrank and Officer Krupke break up a brawl (\"Prologue\"), warning both gangs to stop fighting or they will be arrested. Despite the warning, the Jets challenge the Sharks to a rumble for neighborhood control. | Riff decides that his best friend, Tony (co-founder of the Jets) should fight (\"Jet Song\"). He invites him to a dance, but Tony is uninterested and tells Riff that he senses something important will happen (\"Something's Coming\"). Eventually, Tony agrees to come out of loyalty to Riff. | Bernardo's younger sister, Maria, tells her best friend Anita how excited she is about the dance. The gangs and girls refuse to intermingle at the dance (\"Dance at the Gym\"), despite attempts by a social worker. Tony arrives, he and Maria fall in love, and Bernardo tells him to stay away from her. Riff proposes a war council with Bernardo at Doc's drugstore, and Tony leaves the dance thinking about his new love (\"Maria\"). | Anita tells Bernardo that he is overprotective of Maria, and they join the rest of the Sharks on the roof of their apartment building to compare Puerto Rico to the United States (\"America\"). The Sharks leave, and the girls go to bed. | Tony visits Maria on her fire escape, and they reaffirm their love (\"Tonight\"). The Jets wait for the Sharks outside Doc's drugstore and are visited by Krupke, who warns them not to cause trouble. After he leaves, the Jets lampoon him (\"Gee, Officer Krupke!\"). The Sharks arrive, and the war council begins. They agree to a showdown the following evening under the highway, with a fistfight between Bernardo and Ice. Tony tells Doc about his love for Maria. | The next day at the bridal shop, Maria tells her friends how wonderful it is to be in love (\"I Feel Pretty\"). After closing, Anita mentions the rumble to Maria. Tony arrives; Anita is shocked, and warns them of the consequences if Bernardo learns about their relationship. Maria tells Tony that she has heard about the rumble, and makes him promise to stop it. Tony gives his word, and he and Maria imagine their wedding (\"One Hand, One Heart\"). | The Jets and Sharks prepare for the rumble, Anita prepares for her evening with Bernardo, Tony finishes work at Doc's and Maria awaits her evening with Tony (\"Quintet\"). The gangs arrive, and the fistfight begins. Tony tries to stop the fight, but Bernardo and the Sharks taunt him. Riff hits Bernardo, and the gang leaders draw their switchblades (\"The Rumble\"). Tony is restrained by Ice and Tiger; Riff is stabbed by Bernardo, who is horrified. An enraged Tony grabs Riff's knife and kills Bernardo, triggering a melee. Police car spotlights illuminate the scene and everyone but Tony flees. Anybodys (a tomboy who wants to be a Jet) shows up, grabs the knives, and she and Tony flee. | Maria is waiting for Tony on the roof of her apartment building when Chino tells her what happened. Tony arrives, and asks her forgiveness before turning himself in to the police. Maria tells him not to, and reaffirms her love (\"Somewhere\"). | The Jets reassemble in an alley. Action wants to avenge Riff's death, but Ice tells them how to deal with the police (\"Cool\"). Anybodys warns them that Chino is after Tony with a gun, and Ice sends the Jets to warn him. | Tony and Maria are sleeping when a teary Anita brings Bernardo's jacket. Tony tells Maria to meet him at Doc's store so they can elope. Anita chides Maria for their relationship (\"A Boy Like That\"), but Maria convinces her to help them elope (\"I Have a Love\"). | Schrank questions Maria about the rumble, and has Anita go to Doc's to tell him that she will meet him as soon as possible. The Jets do not believe that she is trying to help Tony, and harass her before she can deliver Maria's message. Anita says that Bernardo was right about them, and tells them that Chino killed Maria to avenge her romance with Tony. | Doc throws the Jets out of the drugstore, and, in innocence, delivers Anita's false message to Tony. Tony runs into the street, shouting to Chino to kill him as well. He sees Maria, and they run toward each other; Chino steps out of the shadows and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks and Doc find Maria holding Tony, who dies as they reaffirm their love (\"Somewhere (Reprise)\"). Maria stops the gangs from fighting again, taking the gun from Chino and blaming everyone for Tony, Bernardo, and Riff's deaths before she collapses in tears. She kisses Tony; three Jets pick him up, and two Sharks help. | The stunned members of both gangs disperse, leaving Chino to be led away by the police.","m_cast":"Natalie Wood as Maria, Bernardo's younger sister, Chino's arranged fianc√©e, falls in love with Tony Marni Nixon as Maria's singing voice | Richard Beymer as Tony, co-founder of the Jets but has outgrown their street culture.

Since he had no experience directing a musical, Wise agreed that Jerome Robbins, who had directed the stage version of West Side Story, would direct the musical and dance sequences. After about one-third of the movie had been shot, the Mirisch Company, concerned that the production was running over-budget, dismissed Robbins. According to Saul Chaplin, Robbins nearly suffered a nervous breakdown during the time he worked on the film. The remaining dance numbers were directed with the help of Robbins' assistants. Recognizing Robbins' considerable creative contribution to the film, Wise agreed that Robbins should be given co-directing credit, even though Wise directed the greater part of the film. The ending title sequence was created by Saul Bass, who is also credited as \"visual consultant\" on the film. | Because the producers wanted actors who looked believable as teenagers, they did not consider 30-year-old Larry Kert, the first Tony on Broadway, or 29-year-old Carol Lawrence, the first Maria, but some had experience in stage productions. Tony Mordente, who played A-Rab on stage, was cast as Action in the film, and George Chakiris, Riff in the London stage production, played Bernardo in the film. Tucker Smith, who joined the Broadway production several months into its run, played Ice, a role created for the film. David Winters, the first stage Baby John, played A-Rab,[2] Eliot Feld, an ensemble member and understudy for Baby John on Broadway, played Baby John. Jay Norman, Juano on stage, appeared as Pepe. Reprising their stage roles in the film were Carole D'Andrea as Velma, Tommy Abott as Gee-Tar, and William Bramley as Officer Krupke. | Elvis Presley was approached for Tony, but his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, strongly believed the role to be wrong for Elvis and made him decline in favor of other movie musicals.[3] According to legend, the Colonel didn't want Elvis associated with gang warfare and knife crime, although three years earlier, Elvis' character Danny Fisher stabbed and killed the small-time gangster 'Shark' played by Vic Morrow in the movie King Creole. When the movie became a hit and earned 10 Oscars, Elvis regretted having given up the part. Others who auditioned for the part included Warren Beatty, Tab Hunter, Anthony Perkins, Russ Tamblyn, Burt Reynolds, Troy Donahue, Bobby Darin, Richard Chamberlain, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Lockwood. | Bobby Darin made a strong impression on the producers at his audition and was, at one point, in talks for the role. However, he turned it down due to his concert and recording commitments. Tab Hunter, then 30, and Burt Reynolds, nearly 26, were also considered, due to their Broadway and singing credits, but they were dismissed because of their age. Richard Chamberlain was also thought too old at age 26. The producers settled on their \"final five\": Warren Beatty, Anthony Perkins, Russ Tamblyn, Troy Donahue, and Richard Beymer. Although he was 28 before filming began, Perkins' boyish looks and Broadway resume seemed to make him a contender for the role, and he was trying to avoid getting typecast after the success of Psycho. Robert Wise originally chose Beatty for the role, figuring that youth was more important than experience. Ultimately, Beymer, the most unlikely of the candidates, won the part of Tony. Tamblyn, after several callbacks, impressed the producers and was given the role of Riff. | Natalie Wood was filming Splendor in the Grass with Warren Beatty and was romantically involved with him off-screen. The producers were considering her for the role of Maria. When Beatty went to screen test for the role of Tony, Wood read opposite him as Maria as a favor because she had been practicing with him. The producers fell in love with the idea of Wood as Maria but did not cast Beatty. | Jill St. John, Audrey Hepburn, Diane Baker, Valerie Harper, Elizabeth Ashley, and Suzanne Pleshette were among the many actresses who lobbied for the role of Maria in the film. However, Hepburn later withdrew because she became pregnant. |  | It is Baby John who is attacked and has his ear stabbed by Sharks. In the stage show, it's A-Rab. David Winters played Baby John on stage and he played A-Rab in the film. Both times he avoided getting attacked by Bernardo. | Ice is a newly created Jet for the film. His name is Diesel onstage | Tonight takes place immediately after the dance in the stage show. In the film it was moved to after America. | The Sharks sing America along with the Shark Girls in the film. It's Just the Shark Girls on stage. Anita and Rosalie sing it on stage, Bernardo takes Rosalie's place in the film. So the majority of the song's lyrics are changed in the film. | In the film Gee, Officer Krupke takes place before Cool and is sung by Riff instead of Action. On stage the songs are reversed. Cool comes first and sung by Riff. Gee, Officer Krupke is sung by Action. | During the Quintet, Riff sings to Tony. In the film, he sings to Ice. | On stage Diesel faces Bernardo during the rumble. in the film, Ice faces him. | On stage, I Feel Pretty is the song that opens the second act. In the film, it takes place before One Hand, One Heart. | On stage, Action takes over as leader when Riff is killed. In the film, Ice takes over. In both versions, Anybodys falls in love with the new leaders after she is accepted. | A lot of the song lyrics in the film are changed from their original stage versions.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"West Side Story by Jerome Robbins Leonard Bernstein Stephen Sondheim Arthur Laurents","m_directed_by":"Robert Wise Jerome Robbins","m_produced_by":"Robert Wise","m_screenplay_by":"Ernest Lehman","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Natalie Wood Richard Beymer Rita Moreno George Chakiris Russ Tamblyn","m_music_by":"Leonard Bernstein Irwin Kostal","m_cinematography":"Daniel L.
