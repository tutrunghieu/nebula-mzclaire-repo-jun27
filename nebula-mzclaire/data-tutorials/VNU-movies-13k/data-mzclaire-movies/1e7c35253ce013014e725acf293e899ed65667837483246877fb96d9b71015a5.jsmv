{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story opens in London in 1992. Paul Raymond (Steve Coogan) returns to his flat after attending the funeral of his daughter Debbie (Imogen Poots). Raymond plays a videotape of a TV programme he and Debbie took part in and reflects on their lives. | In a flashback to the late 1950s, Raymond is an impresario on the seaside variety show circuit, where he is making a name for himself by adding semi-nude women to his stage acts. After a lion attacks the show's dancers, his wife Jean (Anna Friel) joins the show. When the Daily Sketch claims that Jean performed nude, Raymond sues the newspaper unsuccessfully but appreciates the ensuing publicity, after which Raymond launches his London strip club, the Raymond Revue Bar. Its success allows him to expand his property empire and also indulge in a playboy lifestyle, which his wife tolerates. | In the early 1970s, Raymond moves into theatrical revues and casts aspiring actress Amber St. George (Tamsin Egerton) in a nude revue. Raymond moves in with her and his marriage to Jean ends. Raymond also agrees to meet a grown son, Derry, he sired out of wedlock, but after an awkward dinner together, he gives Derry no more of his time. Tony Power is approached by Paul Raymond to run a men's magazine, Men Only. Tony Power, who was only in his 20's at the time, was subsequently corrupted into a sleazy world by Paul Raymond, ending in his untimely demise. The magazine is a huge success, in part thanks to roving sex reporter Fiona Richmond, St. George's pseudonym. Raymond continues to enjoy a hedonistic, coke-fuelled lifestyle. This becomes too much for St. George and their relationship ends. | Into this mix, his daughter Debbie is introduced. Initially, Raymond tries to make her a star in his theatrical ventures, but she lacks talent and the show is an unprecedented failure for her. | Debbie marries musician Jonathan Hodge. Jean returns for the wedding and volunteers to pose nude for Raymond's magazine. In the delivery room, Debbie gives birth to a girl after sniffing a line of coke that her father provides. She dies in 1992 of a heroin overdose.[2] | After the funeral, Raymond returns home with his granddaughter, pointing out the property he owns that will someday belong to her. An epilogue reveals that in December 1992, he was the richest man in Britain.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Look of Love was originally called The King of Soho until that title had to be dropped due to a legal dispute.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Members Only: The Life and Times of Paul Raymond  by Paul Willetts[1]","m_directed_by":"Michael Winterbottom","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Steve Coogan Imogen Poots Anna Friel Tamsin Egerton","m_music_by":"Antony Genn Martin Slattery","m_cinematography":"Hubert Taczanowski","m_edited_by":"Mags Arnold","m_production_company":"Film4 Baby Cow Productions Revolution Films","m_distributed_by":"StudioCanal UK","m_release_dates":"26 April 2013 (2013-04-26) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"101 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Look of Love is a 2013 British biopic of Paul Raymond, directed by Michael Winterbottom.
