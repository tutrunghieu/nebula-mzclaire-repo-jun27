However, in an interview in 1975 or '76, Buñuel claimed that he had used a dead calf's eye.[13] Through the use of intense lighting, and bleaching of the calf's skin, Buñuel attempted to make the furred face of the animal appear as human skin. | During the bicycle scene, the woman who is sitting on a chair, reading, throws the book aside when she notices the man who has fallen. The image it shows when it lays open is a reproduction of a painting by Vermeer, whom Dalí greatly admired and often referred to in his own paintings.[14] | In Buñuel's original script, the final shot was to feature the corpses of the man and woman \"consumed by swarms of flies\". However, this special effect was modified due to budget limitations, with the film ending with a still shot of the man and woman, who had been walking in the previous beach scene, half-buried in the sand and apparently dead.[15] | The movie contains several thematic references to Federico García Lorca and other writers of that time.[16] For example, the rotting donkeys are a reference to the popular children's novel Platero y yo by Juan Ramón Jiménez, which Buñuel and Dalí hated.[17] | Anthropologist Jean Rouch has reported that after filming was complete, Buñuel and Dalí had run out of money, forcing Buñuel to edit the film personally in his kitchen without the aid of a Moviola or any other technical equipment.[18]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Luis Buñuel","m_produced_by":"Luis Buñuel Pierre Braunberger","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Pierre Batcheff Simone Mareuil Luis Buñuel Salvador Dalí Jaime Miravilles","m_music_by":"Richard Wagner","m_cinematography":"Albert Dubergen Jimmy Berliet (uncredited)","m_edited_by":"Luis Buñuel","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Les Grands Films Classiques (France)","m_release_dates":"6 June 1929 (1929-06-06) (France) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"21 minutes","m_country":null,"m_language":"Silent film (French intertitles)","m_budget":"< 100,000 francs | Un Chien Andalou (French pronunciation: ​[œ̃ ʃjɛ̃ ɑ̃dalu], An Andalusian Dog) is a 1929 silent surrealist short film by the Spanish director Luis Buñuel and artist Salvador Dalí.[1] It was Buñuel's first film and was initially released in 1929 with a limited showing at Studio des Ursulines in Paris, but became popular and ran for eight months.[2] | The film has no plot in the conventional sense of the word. The chronology of the film is disjointed, jumping from the initial \"once upon a time\" to \"eight years later\" without the events or characters changing very much. It uses dream logic in narrative flow that can be described in terms of then-popular Freudian free association, presenting a series of tenuously related scenes. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Un Chien Andalou\".
