{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Many Chicago citizens run towards the wall, but soldiers under Evelyn (Naomi Watts) are told to shut down the perimeter, and thus, no one is allowed through. Evelyn directs Jack Kang (Daniel Dae Kim) of Candor to hold trials for the Erudite and Dauntless conspirators, in which a number of them becoming executions, starting with Max (Mekhi Phifer). Evelyn and Johanna (Octavia Spencer) attempt to pressure Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) into taking leadership positions in the new coalition, but both refuse. After seeing that the hostile situation within the city is only going to get worse, Tris escapes with Four, Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Christina (Zoë Kravitz), Tori (Maggie Q), and Peter (Miles Teller) to journey beyond the wall that encloses Chicago. However, Tori is killed by Edgar (Jonny Weston) in the attempt. | The group is ambushed by Edgar, who is later disabled by an armed group of individuals and airships. The soldiers take the group to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, a highly advanced city where they learn that years ago the government believed that society's problems were caused by \"damaged genes\". In an attempt to create a better society, they began to modify people's genes, with disastrous results. The government set up \"experiments\" in an attempt to repair this mistake, establishing isolated cities across the remains of the United States. The hope is to raise enough genetically pure Divergent individuals to fix the \"genetic damage\" left in the wake of the Purity War. | Tris and Four are tested by Matthew (Bill Skarsgård) and Nita (Nadia Hilker) to verify and study their Divergence. Tris is shown to be truly Divergent, but Four's genetic structure indicates that his genes are still \"damaged\". Caleb and Peter are assigned to surveillance teams that monitor Chicago. Matthew then brings Tris to the leader of the Bureau, David (Jeff Daniels). David gives Tris a device that allows her to view her mother's memories, and sees that her mother was rescued and adopted by the Bureau before volunteering to join the Chicago experiment out of dedication to the project. In return for his help in restoring peace to Chicago, Tris agrees to help David, who claims that only the council he reports to has the power to intervene. | Meanwhile, Four and Christina train with Nita and joins the Bureau's military force. They join the military on a rescue mission to a nearby wasteland village, though Four becomes mistrusting of the Bureau's intentions after realizing that they are going there to kidnap and forcefully integrate children into the Bureau's populace. Upon their return, Four discreetly petitions Caleb to keep an eye on the situation in Chicago. Four also attempts to warn Tris of the Bureau's intentions, but she rejects his ideas. | Caleb warns Four of a rapidly escalating conflict back in Chicago between Johanna's group of Allegiants and Evelyn's factionless, with open war becoming an imminent threat. Four appeals to Tris for her to return to Chicago with him to end the bloodshed, but she decides to go with David to Providence to meet with the council. David agrees to reinsert Four back in Chicago, escorted by Matthew and some Bureau soldiers. Once in the air, Matthew quietly reveals to Four that the flight is a trap and he is meant to be killed. A skirmish breaks out and Four defeats all of the soldiers, though the airship crashes as a result. Matthew betrays David by helping Four get through the cloak wall. Four proceeds to Chicago while Matthew remains behind to be rescued by the Bureau and warn Tris. | Meanwhile, Tris and David meet with the council. Tris disagrees with the council's objectives and criticizes how they have done nothing to stop the violence in Chicago. The council responds that David had the power to intervene whenever he desires, revealing that he has lied to her from the beginning. During the return flight to the Bureau, Tris ends their partnership. Upon her return, she gathers Caleb and Christina in David's airship to return to Chicago, and Nita helps them escape. | Four is captured by the factionless and confronts Evelyn to end the violence although she shows no intention of standing down. Tris, Caleb, and Christina arrive to find the city tearing itself apart at the opening stage of a full assault by the Allegiant. David makes a deal with Peter in exchange for Peter's promotion and inserts him into Chicago to convince Evelyn to deploy a hidden Bureau stockpile of gas to wipe the memories of the attackers and force a peace in her favor, to which she reluctantly agrees. Peter takes her to a vault where she can deploy the gas across the city but remain safe herself, making her the only individual in Chicago who will remember any of those events. | Tris and Christina fight through the factionless and arrive at the vault, having rescued Four along the way. At the vault door, Four convinces Evelyn to stop the gas attack, as he wouldn't remember who she was if she carried it out. She folds and stops the release, and is shot by a frustrated Peter. Peter gloats in his victory until the same gas starts releasing inside the vault as well. Realizing David has betrayed him, Peter opens the vault so Tris and Four can stop the gas release and flees back towards the cloak wall, as Four says he will make him pay for badly wounding his mother. | Caleb arrives and aids Tris in destroying the gas dispersion hub, stopping the release. The main characters gather atop the Erudite building as they watch the stolen shuttle fly back towards the Bureau, heavily laden with explosives. Tris transmits a message to the whole city, revealing to them the existence of the Bureau and that Chicago was an experiment of the Pure. Her message to the Bureau is that Chicago is no longer their experiment, but the home of its citizens. Caleb detonates the explosives at the end of the message, tearing a massive hole through the cloak wall and revealing the two cities to each other. The film ends with the Chicago characters gazing at the Bureau in the distance, with David standing behind Tris via his machine, glaring at her.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"As of June 2, 2016[update], Allegiant has grossed $66.2 million in North America and $110.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $176.9 million.[3] Due to its underperformance, The Hollywood Reporter called it \"the second big-budget miss for Lionsgate this year after Gods of Egypt.\"[21] Many critics have blamed the underperformance of the film on Lionsgate's decision to split the last novel into two pictures.[22][23] As a result, Lionsgate will cut the budget of the fourth and final movie in the series, Ascendant.[9] Despite the box office struggles of Allegiant, Lionsgate still plans to debut the film on June 9, 2017, where it will face competition from Paramount's World War Z 2 and Universal's reboot of The Mummy.[24] Made on a total budget of $183.6 million, including net production budget, advertising and promotion costs, and domestic home entertainment costs, Deadline.com projects the film to make a mere profit of $3.5 million should it earn a net total of $187.1 million from various platforms (including theatrical revenues, TV rights and DVD sales). By comparison, Divergent made a net profit of $71.8 million and Insurgent $30.6 million.[25] | In the United States and Canada, Deadline.com projected the film to make around $28–30 million in its opening weekend from 3,740 theaters, which would make it the lowest opening among the franchise.[2] It earned the lowest previews among the series, with $2.35 million from 2,800 theaters.[26] On its opening day, it made $11.9 million (including previews), down 43.6% from Insurgent, becoming the first film in the series to fail to open with over $20 million. Scott Mendelson of Forbes compared the decline in opening day to the third installment of The Chronicles of Narnia film series, Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which had a similar amount of drop.[27] In comparison, the third Hunger Games film, Mockingjay – Part 1 fell only 21% from its previous film.[27] In its opening weekend, the film grossed $29 million from 3,740 theaters, finishing second at the box office behind Zootopia. It was the first film of the franchise to not finish in first at the box office, and its opening was 46% below Divergent's and 44% behind Insurgent's.[28][29] Lionsgate president of domestic distribution Richard Fay labeled the opening \"pretty solid.\"[23] As a result of the poor opening, Lionsgate's stock fell the next day, on Monday.[30][22] Due to Allegiant's poor box-office resulting in Lionsgate's stock declining 3.3% by 72 cents to $21.13 in trading, Moody's Investors Service lowered Lionsgate's Speculative Grade Liquidity rating from SGL-2 to SGL-3.[31] | The Divergent Series: Allegiant also struggled internationally where Lionsgate does not have operations in most countries and sells distribution rights to partners.[23] It opened in 45 international markets a week ahead of its US debut, from March 9,[32] and will receive a scattered release worldwide. Unlike its predecessor Insurgent, Lionsgate decided to not to have a day and date release for Allegiant, instead intending to take advantage of various school holidays in international markets, and at the same time avoid competition with Walt Disney's animated Zootopia.[33] Allegiant took the top spot in its opening day in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden.[33] In its opening weekend, it earned $25.2 million from over 7,000 screens in 45 countries.[34] It added 32 markets in its second weekend, earning a total of $22 million from 77 countries, which is down 13%.[35] The top openings were in France ($5 million), Brazil ($2.7 million), the United Kingdom and Ireland ($2.6 million), Mexico ($2.5 million).[34][35] In the United Kingdom, it posted the lowest opening in the series, opening at No. 2 behind Kung Fu Panda 3 including previews, which is 37% behind the opening of Insurgent.[36] It had a very unsuccessful opening in South Korea with $523,000 from 392 screens.[37] In China, it opened in third place behind The Angry Birds Movie and Captain America: Civil War with $10.8 million. As a result it helped the film cross the $100 million mark internationally and immediately became the film's second biggest market behind Italy only.[38] In terms of total earnings, its largest markets are France ($15.1 million), followed by Brazil ($6.9 million), the U.K. ($6.5 million), Russia ($6 million) and Spain ($5.1 million).[37] | The Divergent Series: Allegiant was met with mostly negative reviews by critics, who criticized the lack of originality and character advancement.[39][23] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 12%, based on 160 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10, and earning a 0% rating from top critics. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Allegiant improves on previous entries in The Divergent Series on a few superficial levels, but they aren't enough to counteract a sense of growing boredom with a franchise that's gone on too long.\"[40] Metacritic gives the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[41] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[2]","m_production":"In December 2013, Summit Entertainment announced that the film adaptation of Allegiant, the third and final novel in the Divergent trilogy, would be released in March 2016, serving as the finale of the series, which at the time was planned as a trilogy.[5] On April 11, 2014, the studio decided to split the novel into a two-part film, much like the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games franchises did with the finales of their series. Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-chairmen Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger said in a statement that, \"Veronica Roth brings her captivating story to a masterful conclusion in ‘Allegiant,’ a rich, action-packed book with material that is ideally suited to two strong and fulfilling movies. The storytelling arc and world of the characters lend themselves perfectly to two films, a storytelling strategy that has worked very well for us on the two ‘Twilight Breaking Dawn’ films and about which we’re tremendously enthusiastic for the two upcoming ‘Mockingjay’ films of ‘The Hunger Games’ franchise\".[13] On July 9, 2014, Noah Oppenheim was announced as the screenwriter for the first part of the Allegiant adaptation.[14] On December 5, 2014, it was announced that Robert Schwentke would return to direct Part 1.[15] On September 10, 2015, it was announced that the two-part finale would be re-titled, with Part 1 being renamed as The Divergent Series: Allegiant and Part 2 as The Divergent Series: Ascendant.[16] | In March 2015, it was confirmed that Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ansel Elgort, Zoë Kravitz, Maggie Q, Naomi Watts, Miles Teller, Keiynan Lonsdale, and Octavia Spencer would all reprise their roles from the previous films.[17] | On April 28, 2015, it was reported that Jeff Daniels had joined the cast as David, the leader of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.[10] On May 1, 2015, it was announced that Bill Skarsgård had joined the cast as Matthew.[11] | Filming began on May 18, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia[18][19] and concluded on August 23, 2015.
