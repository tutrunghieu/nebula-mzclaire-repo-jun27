{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A group of astronauts set out to stop the asteroid Flora, which is on a collision course with the planet Earth. They land on the asteroid, plant explosive charges and destroy it. Afterwards they return to the staging area, a space station called Gamma 3 in orbit around the Earth. Unfortunately, a scientist from the mission has unwittingly carried a luminous-green substance on the leg of his spacesuit which quickly mutates into one-eyed, tentacled monsters with the ability to discharge lethal bolts of electricity. The Gamma 3 crew fend off the alien creatures with their laser-based weaponry, only to discover the creatures feed off the energy which, in turn, allows them to multiply rapidly, sprouting the new creatures from their blood. As the creatures overrun the station the crew continues to fight back against overwhelming odds.","m_cast":"Source:[1] | Robert Horton as Commander Jack Rankin | Richard Jaeckel as Commander Vince Elliott | Luciana Paluzzi as Dr. Lisa Benson | Bud Widom as General Jonathan B.

The review commented on the monsters in the film, stating that \"the first appearance of the green slime looks promising, but the transformation of the lurid jelly into stock monsters is something of a let-down\"[8] Variety referred to the film as \"a poor man's version of 2001\", and described the story, script and special effects as \"amateurish\".[4] The New York Times stated that the film \"opens promisingly, keeps it up for about half an hour but then fades badly [...] the picture falls to pieces when the green menace becomes an army of rubbery-looking goblins.\"[9] | In retrospective reviews, Stuart Galbraith IV discussed the film in his book Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, finding that Fukasaku's direction was \"flat and uninteresting\" and that the special effects by ex-Toho employees Yukio Manoda and Akira Watanabe were worse than their previous work with Eiji Tsuburaya, noting that the \"miniatures are badly lit and lacking in detail.\"[4] Galbraith commented that the film was \"ultimately undone by some of the most laughably ridiculous monsters in screen history\" and that \"the film isn't bad until the critters show up\"[10][11] In Phil Hardy's book Science Fiction (1984), the film was described as \"not a very convincing entry in the vegetable monster movie sub-genre [sic?]\".[12]","m_production":"The Green Slime was a co-production between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Toei.[3] MGM provided the funding and script while Toei provided the film crew and location to shoot the film.[3] | The original storyline for The Green Slime originated in Italy, where MGM also had dealings.[3] Years before The Green Slime went into production, MGM had contracted Italian filmmaker Antonio Margheriti to direct what was originally intended to be a series of four television movies about the adventures of a space station called Gamma One.[3] Margheriti's films in the series consisted of Wild, Wild Planet, War of the Planets, War Between the Planets and Snow Devils, all created over a period of three months and released in 1965.[3] MGM was impressed with Margheriti's films and released the four films theatrically.[3] Gamma One producers Manley and Reiner were eager to take advantage of these films and made The Green Slime as an unofficial fifth entry in the film series.[3] The only connection the film had to Margheriti's films is the space station, retitled Gamma Three, which had a similar design as the one in Margheriti's films.[3] | Green Slime was shot in Japan with a predominantly Asian film crew and Caucasian actors.[2] Aside from Horton, Jaeckel and Paluzzi, the rest of the cast consisted of amateur and semi-professional Caucasian actors living in Japan at the time.[4] Yoshikazu Yamasawa was the cinematographer,[1] and the film was edited by Osamu Tanaka.[1] Toshiaki Tsushima composed the original score.[1] Charles Fox re-scored much of the film for its release in United States, including the title song.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Kinji Fukasaku","m_produced_by":"Walter Manley | Ivan Reiner","m_screenplay_by":"William Finger | Tom Rowe | Charles Sinclair","m_story_by":"Ivan Reiner","m_starring":"Robert Horton | Richard Jaeckel | Luciana Paluzzi","m_music_by":"Toshiaki Tsushima","m_cinematography":"Yoshikazu Yamasawa","m_edited_by":"Osamu Tanaka","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (American version) | ","m_release_dates":"December 1, 1968 (1968-12-01) (United States) | December 1968 (1968-12) (Japan) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"90 minutes","m_country":"Japan | United States[discuss] | The Green Slime (ガンマー第3号 宇宙大作戦, Ganmā Daisan Gō: Uchū Daisakusen?) is a 1968 science fiction film directed by Kinji Fukasaku[1] and produced by Walter Manley and Ivan Reiner.[2] It was written by William Finger, Tom Rowe and Charles Sinclair[1][2] from a story by Reiner.[1] The film was shot in Japan with a Japanese director and film crew, but a non-Japanese cast of Robert Horton, Richard Jaeckel and Luciana Paluzzi. |  | ","m_language":null,"m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Green Slime at the Internet Movie Database | The Green Slime at AllMovie | The Green Slime at Rotten Tomatoes | The Green Slime trailer on YouTube | The Green Slime synopsis and review from And You Call Yourself a Scientist | \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" The Green Slime (TV episode 1988) at the Internet Movie Database | Episode guide: K00- The Green Slime (the unaired pilot)","m_poster":"Ganmā Daisan Gō: Uchū Daisakusen","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
