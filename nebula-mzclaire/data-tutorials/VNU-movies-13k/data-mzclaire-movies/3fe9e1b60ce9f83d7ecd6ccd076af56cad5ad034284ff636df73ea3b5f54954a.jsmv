{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1993, professional basketball player Michael Jordan announces his retirement from the sport to follow his late father's career as a baseball player. However, it becomes evident that he is not as skilled in baseball as he was in basketball. Jordan is assigned a publicist, the bumbling Stan Podolak, to make his new career less bumpy. Elsewhere, in outer space, an intergalactic amusement park called Moron Mountain faces dwindling popularity, so its owner, Mr. Swackhammer, sends his diminutive minions, the Nerdlucks, to capture the Looney Tunes as new entertainment. The Looney Tunes live in an animated world hidden in the center of the Earth, but are unable to listen to the Nerdlucks' threats and challenge them to a game of basketball to try to win back their freedom, thinking they'll win since the Nerdlucks are tiny. | The Nerdlucks steal the talents of basketball players Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues, leaving them incapable of playing. The Nerdlucks absorb the talent, transforming into the gigantic \"Monstars\" who easily intimidate the Looney Tunes. While playing golf with Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and Stan, Jordan is sucked down a hole and is recruited by Bugs Bunny to help the Tunes win against the Monstars. Jordan at first refuses, saying he does not play basketball anymore, but changes his decision and agrees to help when the Monstars insult and humiliate him, and hurt Tweety, but first sends Bugs and Daffy Duck to his house to retrieve his basketball gear. The two have a difficult time obtaining the clothes due to the interruption of Jordan's pet dog, but his children help them out. | Meanwhile, Stan has been digging out the golf hole to find Jordan, but spots Bugs and Daffy leap down another one and pursues them, reuniting with Jordan in the Tunes' world and joins the Tune Squad. Another new recruit is Lola Bunny, a skilled basketball player whom Bugs falls in love with. The day of the match arrives, but the first half is dominated by the Monstars, leaving the Looney Tunes unconfident. Stan overhears a conversation between the Monstars and Swackhammer, learning of how they gained their talent and informs Jordan. Bugs and Jordan convince the rest of the Tune Squad to fight back, and the first half of the second round allows the characters to take the lead using old school gags and Acme weaponry. Swackhammer decides he wants Jordan as a new attraction, and makes an agreement with him that he will become an attraction if he loses the match, sparing the Looney Tunes. | To ensure his victory, Swackhammer has the Monstars play dirty and injure all of the Tune Squad until only Jordan, Bugs, Daffy, Lola, and Stan are left. Stan becomes the fifth player and manages to score, but is literally flattened by the Monstars and is removed from the court to be inflated. The referee, Marvin the Martian, informs Jordan unless the team gets a fifth player, then the game is forfeit. Bill Murray appears and volunteers to be the team's fifth member. In the final seconds of the game, Jordan gains the ball and manages to use cartoon physics to extend his arm and score the winning points. Murray retires from the sport, and the Monstars blast Swackhammer to the Moon in a rocket when they realize they do not have to take his abuse anymore. Jordan convinces them to give up the stolen talents and they are welcomed to stay with the Looney Tunes. | Jordan and a recovered Stan return to the surface, the Nerdlucks dropping them off at Jordan's next baseball game. Later on, the two visit the incapacitated basketball players and return their talent. The players invite Jordan to a three-on-three match but when he declines, they question his loss of talent. In a move mirroring his actual comeback in 1995, Jordan returns to the Chicago Bulls to reprise his basketball career.","m_cast":"Michael Jordan as himself, an NBA shooting guard for the Chicago Bulls who retires to pursue a career in baseball.

The site's consensus reads, \"A harmless mishmash of basketball and animation that'll entertain kids but leave adults less than thrilled.\"[6] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Space Jam a thumbs up,[7] as did Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, although his zeal was more subdued.[8] In his print review, Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 stars out of 4, noting, \"Space Jam is a happy marriage of good ideas—three films for the price of one, giving us a comic treatment of the career adventures of Michael Jordan, crossed with a Looney Tunes cartoon and some showbiz warfare. ... the result is delightful, a family movie in the best sense (which means the adults will enjoy it, too).\"[7] Siskel focused much of his praise on Jordan's performance, saying, \"He wisely accepted as a first movie a script that builds nicely on his genial personality in an assortment of TV ads. The sound bites are just a little longer.\"[8] Leonard Maltin also gave the film a positive review (3 stars), stating, \"Jordan is very engaging, the vintage characters perform admirably ... and the computer-generated special effects are a collective knockout.\"[9] Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film for its humor. He also praised the Looney Tunes' antics and Jordan's acting.[10] | Although Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the film's animation, she later went on to say that the film is a \"fond tribute to [the Looney Tunes characters'] past.\"[3] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune complained about some aspects of the movie, stating, \"...we don't get the co-stars' best stuff. Michael doesn't soar enough. The Looney Tuners don't pulverize us the way they did when Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng or Bob Clampett were in charge.\" Yet overall he also liked the film, giving it 3 stars and saying: \"Is it cute? Yes. Is it a crowd-pleaser? Yup. Is it classic? Nope. (Though it could have been.)\"[11] | Other critics were less than kind. TV Guide gave the movie only 2 stars, calling it a \"cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of Warner Bros. cartoon characters and basketball player Michael Jordan, inspired by a Nike commercial.\"[12] Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the film 2 1/2 stars, saying, \"Technical spectacle amounts do nothing without a good story.\"[13] | Veteran Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies director Chuck Jones was highly critical of the film. In a 1998 interview, he expressed his views that the film was \"terrible\" and said, as a man who worked with the characters for almost thirty years, the story was deeply flawed. \"I can tell you, with the utmost confidence,\" he said, \"Porky Pig would never say 'I think I wet myself'\". Jones also added that, were the film more true to the source material, Bugs Bunny would not have incorporated the help of Jordan or the other Looney Tunes characters to defeat the Nerdlucks, \"and moreover, it wouldn't have taken him an hour and a half. Those aliens, whether they were tiny or colossal, would've been dealt with in short order come the seven minute mark.\"[14] | Space Jam was a box office success. At the end of its run, it grossed approximately $90.4 million in the United States and an estimated $230–$250 million internationally.[15][16] It is the highest grossing basketball film of all time[17] and the third highest-grossing sports film, behind Rocky IV and The Blind Side.[18] | 1997 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards Won: Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures (Diane Warren for the song \"For You I Will\") Won: Top Box Office Films (Jamshied Sharifi) | 1997 Annie Awards Won: Best Individual Achievement: Technical Achievement Nomination: Best Animated Feature Nomination: Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a Feature Production (Bruce W.
