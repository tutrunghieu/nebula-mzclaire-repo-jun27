{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The first third of the film is told from the main character's, Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric), or Jean-Do as his friends call him, first person perspective. The film opens as Bauby wakes from his three-week coma in a hospital in Berck-sur-Mer, France. After an initial rather over-optimistic analysis from one doctor, a neurologist explains that he has locked-in syndrome, an extremely rare condition in which the patient is almost completely physically paralyzed, but remains mentally normal. At first, the viewer primarily hears Bauby's \"thoughts\" (he thinks he is speaking but no one hears him), which are inaccessible to the other characters (who are seen through his one functioning eye). | A speech therapist and physical therapist try to help Bauby become as functional as possible. Bauby cannot speak, but he develops a system of communication with his speech and language therapist by blinking his left eye as she reads a list of letters to laboriously spell out his messages, letter by letter. | Gradually, the film's restricted point of view broadens out, and the viewer begins to see Bauby from \"outside\", in addition to experiencing incidents from his past, including a visit to Lourdes. He also fantasizes, imagining beaches, mountains, the Empress Eugénie and an erotic feast with one of his transcriptionists. It is revealed that Bauby had been editor of the popular French fashion magazine Elle, and that he had a deal to write a book (which was originally going to be based on The Count of Monte Cristo but from a female perspective). He decides that he will still write a book, using his slow and exhausting communication technique. A woman from the publishing house with which Bauby had the original book contract is brought in to take dictation. | The new book explains what it is like to now be him, trapped in his body, which he sees as being within an old-fashioned deep-sea diving suit with a brass helmet, which is called a scaphandre in French, as in the original title. Others around see his spirit, still alive, as a \"Butterfly\". | The story of Bauby's writing is juxtaposed with his recollections and regrets until his stroke. We see the mother of his three children (whom he never married), his children, his mistress, his friends, and his father. He encounters people from his past whose lives bear similarities to his own \"entrapment\": a friend who was kidnapped in Beirut and held in solitary confinement for four years, and his own 92-year-old father, who is confined to his own apartment, because he is too frail to descend four flights of stairs. | Bauby eventually completes his memoir and hears the critics' responses. He dies of pneumonia ten days after its publication. The closing credits are accentuated by reversed shootings of breaking glacier ice (the forward versions are used in the opening credits), accompanied by the Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros song \"Ramshackle Day Parade\".","m_cast":"Mathieu Amalric as Jean-Dominique Bauby | Emmanuelle Seigner as Céline Desmoulins | Anne Consigny as Claude Mendibil | Marie-Josée Croze as Henriette Durand | Olatz López Garmendia as Marie Lopez | Patrick Chesnais as Dr. Lepage | Max von Sydow as Mr. Bauby Sr. | Isaach De Bankolé as Laurent | Marina Hands as Joséphine | Niels Arestrup as Roussin | Anne Alvaro as Betty | Zinedine Soualem as Joubert | Emma de Caunes as Empress Eugénie | Françoise Lebrun as Madame Bauby","m_reception":"The film received universal acclaim from critics.

According to the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, the choice of Julian Schnabel as director was recommended by Depp. Universal subsequently withdrew, and Pathé took up the project two years later. Depp dropped the project due to scheduling conflicts with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.[2] Schnabel remained as director. The film was eventually produced by Pathé and France 3 Cinéma, in association with Banque Populaire Images 7 and the American Kennedy/Marshall Company, and in participation with Canal+ and Ciné Cinémas. | According to the New York Sun, Schnabel insisted that the movie should be in French, resisting pressure by the production company to make it in English, believing that the rich language of the book would work better in the original French, and even went so far as to learn French to make the film.[3] Harwood tells a slightly different story: Pathé wanted \"to make the movie in both English and French, which is why bilingual actors were cast\"; he continues that \"Everyone secretly knew that two versions would be impossibly expensive\", and that \"Schnabel decided it should be made in French\".[4] | Schnabel said his influence for the film was drawn from personal experience: | Several key aspects of Bauby's personal life were fictionalized in the film, most notably his relationships with the mother of his children and his girlfriend.[6] [7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly  by Jean-Dominique Bauby","m_directed_by":"Julian Schnabel","m_produced_by":"Kathleen Kennedy Jon Kilik","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mathieu Amalric | Emmanuelle Seigner | Marie-Josée Croze | Anne Consigny | Max von Sydow","m_music_by":"Paul Cantelon","m_cinematography":"Janusz Kamiński","m_edited_by":"Juliette Welfling","m_production_company":"Canal+ Kennedy/Marshall Company France 3 Cinéma","m_distributed_by":"Pathé (France) Miramax Films","m_release_dates":"May 22, 2007 (2007-05-22) (Cannes Film Festival) | May 23, 2007 (2007-05-23) (France) | February 1, 2008 (2008-02-01) (United States) |  | ","m_running_time":"112 minutes","m_country":"France United States","m_language":"French","m_budget":"$10,8 million","m_box_office":"$19,8 million[1] | The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (French: Le scaphandre et le papillon) is a 2007 biographical drama film based on Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir of the same name.
