{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Mr. and Mrs. Cherrywood are a middle-aged couple who run an orphanage. Mr. Cherrywood tells the orphans a story about the Care Bears and Care-a-Lot, their home in the clouds. In the story, Friend Bear and Secret Bear travel looking for people to cheer up. They meet Kim and Jason, two lonely orphaned children. Friend Bear and Secret Bear introduce themselves and remind the children of their ambitions, but neither of them are interested. | At an amusement park, Tenderheart Bear spots a magician's apprentice named Nicholas. While unloading a trunk of goods for his master, the \"Great Fettucini\", Nicholas finds an old book with a diary-style lock. When he unlocks it, an evil spirit appears as a woman's face, and starts corrupting him. With his help, it lays waste to the park, and begins a quest to remove all caring from the world. | Back at Care-a-Lot, some of the other bears are working on their new invention: the Rainbow Rescue Beam, a portal that can send any bear to Earth and back. The two Care Bear cubs belonging to Grams Bear, Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs, interfere with it and bring forth a group of unexpected visitors: Friend Bear, Secret Bear, Kim, and Jason. The bears introduce themselves to the children, and give them a tour of their home. Tenderheart Bear returns on his now out of control Rainbow Roller just before a \"Cloud Quake\" caused by the spirit, which ruins Care-a-Lot. He informs the others of Nicholas' troubles on Earth. Using the Rainbow Rescue Beam, he sends Kim and Jason to the park, along with Friend Bear and Secret Bear. They end up in the Forest of Feelings when the portal malfunctions. From a nearby river, the rest of the bears begin searching for them aboard a cloud ship called the Cloud Clipper. | Within the Forest, the children and their friends are introduced to Brave Heart Lion and Playful Heart Monkey, two of the Care Bear Cousins. Later on, the other bears discover more of these creatures, among them Cozy Heart Penguin, Lotsa Heart Elephant, Swift Heart Rabbit, and Bright Heart Raccoon. During their stay, the spirit attacks them in several disguises: a spearfish, tree, and eagle. After the Care Bears and their Cousins defeat it, they venture back to Earth to save Nicholas from its influence. | At the park, Nicholas obtains the ingredients for his spell against the children and the creatures. After he casts it, the Care Bears and company engage in a long battle. The bears shoot beams of bright light on him, forming their \"Stare\"; the Cousins help with their \"Call\". As the creatures' power drains away, Nicholas and the spirit briefly regain control. After Kim and Jason assist him, he finally realizes his misdeeds. With Secret Bear's help, he closes the spirit's face back into the book and saves himself, the park, and the world. He thanks the group and reunites with Fettucini, while Tenderheart Bear inducts the Care Bear Cousins into the Care Bear Family, and Kim and Jason find new parents who take them to one of Nicholas' shows. | As Mr. Cherrywood finishes his story, it is revealed that he is actually Nicholas, and that his wife is Kim. Tenderheart Bear, who has been listening from outside a window, returns to Care-a-Lot in his Cloudmobile. The film ends with every member of the Care Bear Family waving good-bye.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"\"Movies for 6-year-old girls are as scarce these days as hot fudge sundaes in the Sahara and, if The Care Bears Movie satisfies a first-grader's craving for diversion, then I am satisfied.\" | \"No one but a grinch would point out that The Care Bears Movie has a strange similarity to a 75-minute commercial for the snuggly little greeting card varmints on which it is based. | \"No one but a craven wretch would stoop to pointing out that the animation in this theatrical release is no better than the goshawful techniques used to grind out those despicable Saturday morning TV cartoons. After all, even the Disney people aren't making them like the Disney people used to do.\" | \"Understand that Care Bears: The Movie simply and logically in the merchandisers' minds follows Care Bears: The Pyjamas, Care Bears: The Lunchboxes, Care Bears: The Pillow Cases and, of course, Care Bears: The Bears, the stuffed toys that started it all.\" | \"These multi-coloured ursine cartoon characters, with names like Funshine Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Baby Hugs Bear—I won't go on—are about as nourishing for children as sugar is for their teeth. Why even the Americans should bother to create this syrupy bear garden called Care-a-lot, dripping with singing quadrupeds who want to save the world from evil, is a mystery to anyone who has seen the fun and fibre that can be obtained from infinitely better children's stories, especially the droll moral fables in Winnie the Pooh.\" | The Care Bears Movie received mixed reviews. During its original release, The Care Bears Movie had varying degrees of success with critics.[171] The New York Times' Richard Grenier wrote, \"[The film] recalls vintage Walt Disney, both in substance and in the style of hand animation.\"[172] Rick Lyman of Knight Ridder News Services said in his review: \"Any movie—even an animated one—that has characters with names such as Funshine Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, and Lotsa Heart Elephant is obviously going to rank quite high on the cute meter. And this one sends the needle right off the chart. You've never seen such cuteness.\"[173] Adele Freedman also gave it a positive review, commenting: \"[It] has a lot going for it if you can tolerate the Bears.\"[11] Edward Jones of Virginia's The Free Lance-Star praised it, but stated that \"More comedy would have helped broaden [its] appeal to older youngsters.\"[174] The Deseret News of Utah gave it three stars out of four (a \"Good\" grade) with this comment: \"Sticky sweet, but a nice message.\"[175] | Michael Blowen began his review of the film by stating that \"[it] satisfies the primary obligation of a bedtime story—before it's half over the children will be fast asleep.\" He added that \"this sugar-coated trifle could only satisfy the most ardent Care Bears fan\", and that \"the characters themselves lack definition\".[70] The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said, \"Who except a callous scrooge would carp about the fact that The Care Bears Movie espouses a psychopop philosophy of 'sharing our feelings' that seems drawn straight from the pages on one of those insufferable self-motivation tomes? No one, that's who.\"[169] In the words of The Washington Post reviewer Paul Attanasio, \"The best cartoons recognize the dark side of kids, their penchant for violence, their fearful fantasies. [This movie] just patronizes them. It even has a child chortling, 'Aren't parents great!' Well, they are and they aren't, and kids know that.\"[176] | The animation in the film received mixed reviews as well. Adele Freedman praised the style and backgrounds, and called the special effects \"stunning\".[11] Likewise, John Stanley wrote that \"The style is cartoonish and cute\" in his 1988 film guide, Revenge of the Creature Features.[177] While complimenting it as \"a harmless film diversion\", Stephen Hunter said that \"the movie has the lustrous, glossy look of the very best in children's book illustrations\". \"On the other hand,\" he added, \"the producers obviously couldn't afford an expensive [multiplane] camera, the staple of the Disney product, and so the scenes have a depressing flatness to them. And the backgrounds, so brilliantly developed in Disney, tend to be blurry and hastily done.\"[69] Jim Moorhead of Florida's The Evening Independent said, \"[Nelvana's] animation is not the best. Far from it. Everything's in pastels, fine details are largely missing, mouth movements are minimal and the motions of the figures are scarcely better than some of those awful Saturday morning cartoons on TV.\"[178] The staff at Variety magazine stated that the \"style ... tends towards a primer reading level.\"[179] Halliwell's Film Guide called it \"sluggishly animated and narrated\".[180] As with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,[106] The New York Times' Janet Maslin found that the quality paled in comparison to Disney features (in this case, 1940's Pinocchio).[181] | The Los Angeles Times' Charles Solomon (in his 1989 book Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation),[85] and Michael Janusonis of Rhode Island's Providence Journal,[182] faulted the plot. The Evening Independent's Moorhead and Jim Davidson of the Pittsburgh Press noticed at least two parallel storylines in the film, one of which involved the magician Nicholas.[178][183] The National Coalition on Television Violence counted at least 20 acts of violence throughout the picture.[184] | Critics questioned its purpose as a feature-length advertisement for Care Bears merchandise;[185] among them were Charles Solomon,[85] Paul Attanasio,[176] The Morning Call of Pennsylvania,[186] and Bill Cosford of The Miami Herald.[187] The Boca Raton News' Skip Sheffield commented, \"I couldn't help being bothered by the blatant commercialism of this whole venture.\"[188] The British magazine Films and Filming remarked: \"The purpose of the film is presumably to sell more toys as it unashamedly pushes the message that without at least one Care Bear around life can be very lonely.\"[189] Stoffman observed, \"one of the youngest target audiences of any animated movie\",[155] as did the Halliwell's staff;[180] film critic Leonard Maltin (in his Movie Guide);[190] and Henry Herx (in his Family Guide to Movies on Video).[191] | The 1986 International Film Guide called it \"an elementary piece of animation lacking colour and character, with not much humour, quite lacking in charm, and indifferently scored\".[192] Maltin gave it two stars out of four in his Movie Guide;[190] similarly, the Gale Group publication, VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, gave it two bones out of four in its 1997 edition.[193][nb 17] According to Derek Owen of Time Out's Film Guide, \"Adults forced to accompany three-year-olds to the movie would have had a little moment of satisfaction when the time came to shovel the Care Bears toys out of the house into landfill sites.\"[195] | The mixed reception carried on in the years ahead: in her 1995 book Inside Kidvid, Loretta MacAlpine said of the film and its subsequent follow-ups, \"If you can hack the sugarcoated attitudes of this group of cuddly bears, more power to you! There's nothing insidious about the Care Bears, but their overbearing sweetness may not appeal to all viewers.\" She cautioned parents of the merchandising aspect behind the tapes.[196] Dave Gathman of Illinois' Courier-News wrote in 1998, \"One Care Bears Movie ... can give all G-rated entertainment a bad name.\"[197] In 2003 the Erie Times-News acknowledged its financial success, but commented on its \"lack of a creative title\".[198] Animation expert Jerry Beck wrote in his 2005 book, The Animated Movie Guide, \"It's a simple, serviceable adventure with several standout sequences. ... There's no doubt about it, this is a children's film aimed at the under-seven crowd. But it's one of the better animated children's films produced during this period.\"[12] | In his Christian Science Monitor review, David Sterritt observed that The Care Bears Movie was mostly influenced by The Sorcerer's Apprentice, a 1797 poem by German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, along with \"a trace of H. P. Lovecraft \"that probably wasn't intended\". He went on to say, \"I also noticed a subtle sexism at work. Why must it be the little girl [Kim] who dreams of being a nurse and the little boy [Jason] of being a jet pilot—and not the other way around, to stimulate young imaginations instead of echoing past patterns?\"[199] Blowen wrote that the two children both get turned \"from cynics to idealists\".[70] Joe Fox of Ontario's The Windsor Star, and Stephen Hunter, compared the Bears' home of Care-a-lot to King Arthur's mythical castle of Camelot;[170] Blowen commented that in this place, \"altruism is king\".[70] Hunter noted that \"the celestial physics are left vague\", concerning Kim and Jason's trip from Care-a-lot to the Forest of Feelings.[69] Critics compared at least two aspects of the film to Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: the Spirit received similarities to the Magic Mirror and the Wicked Queen,[69][174][178][179] but Charles Solomon felt that the Bears lacked the individual qualities of the Dwarfs.[85] Solomon noted that in animated features of that era, villains such as the Spirit \"lacked motivation—if the viewer accepts their evil intentions, it's only because he's been told to\".[200] According to Tom Ogden (in his 1997 book Wizards and Sorcerers: From Abracabadra to Zoroaster), the Bears' Stare against the Spirit serves as a kind of white magic.[201][nb 18] \"Such a non-violent solution,\" wrote Bruce Bailey in The Montreal Gazette, \"should sit well with peace lobbyists\".[203] According to a 2005 article in The Times of London, an Internet reviewer called The Care Bears Movie \"a fine example of Christian socialism\".[204] | At the 1985 Genie Awards in its native Canada, The Care Bears Movie won the Golden Reel Award for being the country's highest-grossing film of the year.[100] Ron Cohen, president of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, presented the award to producers Hirsh, Loubert, and Smith.[205][206] John Sebastian's \"Nobody Cares Like a Bear\" received a Genie nomination for Best Original Song;[207] his performance was part of CBC's live telecast of the ceremony on March 20, 1986.[208] The film received a Young Artist Award nomination for \"Best Family Animation Series or Special\", but lost to the CBS series The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show.[209] During its 21st annual award ceremony on October 17, 1985, Nashville's performance rights organization SESAC honoured Woodward and Bird for their songwriting efforts.[210]","m_production":"The Care Bears were created in 1981 by Those Characters from Cleveland (TCFC), a division of the Cleveland greeting card company American Greetings Corporation (AGC).[12] That same year, the title characters made their debut on greeting cards by Elena Kucharik,[15] while American Greetings began to develop a feature-length film using the characters.[16] Kucharik, along with Linda Denham,[17] Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, and Clark Wiley, created the original characters.[2][18] Early in their tenure, the Bears appeared as toys from the Kenner company,[19] and starred in two syndicated television specials from a Canadian animation studio, Atkinson Film-Arts of Ottawa: The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings (1983) and The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine (1984).[20] | Production of the first feature took place at another Canadian outlet, Toronto's Nelvana studio. This came in a period in the company's history which Nelvana co-founder Michael Hirsh refers to as its \"dark years\".[21][nb 6] At the time, Nelvana had just finished production of its first full-length film, 1983's Rock & Rule, which was produced using almost all of its resources (for around US$8 million),[23][24] and failed to find proper distribution.[12] The film put them on the verge of closing down. Soon after, the Nelvana team began doing work on television shows like Inspector Gadget (from DIC Entertainment),[21][25] 20 Minute Workout (from Orion Television),[25] and Mr. Microchip.[21] During this period, they also made syndicated specials based on American Greetings properties: Strawberry Shortcake,[23] The Get Along Gang,[26] and Herself the Elf.[27] \"In some instances,\" noted Harvey Levin, vice-president of marketing and entertainment communications at TCFC,[28] \"their capabilities [on the Strawberry Shortcake specials] surpassed Disney quality.\"[23] Various companies vied to produce a Care Bears feature, and Nelvana was the first to do so;[23] Hirsh sought to seize the opportunity after hearing of its development.[29] DIC Entertainment also expressed interest.[29] Thanks to the Strawberry Shortcake specials and their experience on Rock & Rule,[30][24] Nelvana acquired the rights to the characters and gained a contract from American Greetings to create the script.[30][21][23] To convince the production partnership of TCFC and Kenner Toys, Hirsh held a competition inspired by Pepsi-Cola's \"Pepsi Challenge\" commercials of the time, in which he tested clips from Nelvana and other vying studios and checked the \"animation quality, music, sound effects, and colour\" of each. He then asked the producers to decide on the best demo, and Nelvana scored highest. Hirsh later recalled the words of his partners: \"We know you've rigged this against everybody else because you've chosen the clips. But we like the approach.\"[30] | The Care Bears Movie was one of the first films to be based directly on an established toy line.[31] It featured the ten original Bears, along with six additions to the line-up,[23] and marked the media debut of the Care Bear Cousins.[1][2] Produced for at least US$2 million,[nb 1] the film was financed by American Greetings, the owners of the Care Bears franchise; General Mills, the toys' distributor; and television syndicator LBS Communications.[1][34][nb 1] The Kenner company also took part in the production.[1][30] Brought in under budget, The Care Bears Movie became Nelvana's second feature-length production,[41] and was made over an eight-month period that lasted until February 1985.[30][10][21] Michael Hirsh is quoted as saying in Daniel Stoffman's 2002 book, The Nelvana Story: \"Nobody had ever made an animated movie for theatrical release for as little money and in as little time.\"[30] In 2009 his partner, Clive A. Smith, told Canadian Business magazine: \"I swear I grimaced at the thought of doing a Care Bears feature. But Michael [Hirsh] went out and actually brought that project in.\"[42] Nelvana was responsible for the script,[43] several special effects, including those for the \"Care Bear Stare\",[44] and hired musicians and voice actors.[43] With this project, Arna Selznick became the third of only four women ever to direct an animated feature;[12][nb 7] prior to this, she worked on several Nelvana productions, including Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name.[12] Nelvana's founders—Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith—participated as the main producers.[2][12][46][47] The studio's roster included Charles Bonifacio, the director of animation,[2] and supervising animator D. Brewster,[2] who previously took part in the animation courses at Ontario's Sheridan College.[32] Dale Schott, who served as a storyboard artist,[2] remarked that \"Nelvana had a lot to do with reviving the low-budget feature\" with its efforts on The Care Bears Movie.[48] | Four employees of the film's financiers served as executive producers:[2] Louis Gioia Jr., president of Kenner's Marketing Services division;[49][nb 8] Jack Chojnacki, co-president of TCFC;[50] Carole MacGillvray, who became president of General Mills' M.A.D. (Marketing and Design) division in February 1984;[51] and Robert Unkel, LBS' senior vice-president of programming.[52] A fifth producer, American Greetings staffer W. Ray Peterson, went uncredited.[2][53] Three associate producers worked on the film:[2][10] Paul Pressler, another employee at Kenner;[54] John Bohach, who later became LBS' executive vice-president;[55] and Harvey Levin.[2] Lenora Hume, the director of photography on Rock & Rule,[56] was the supervising producer.[2][10] | Along with Inspector Gadget,[25] The Care Bears Movie was Nelvana's first foray into animation outsourcing.[30] Production took place at Nelvana's facilities,[46] Taiwan's Wang Film Productions (Cuckoo's Nest Studio),[2][57] and the newly established Hanho Heung-Up and Mihahn studios in South Korea.[2] Delaney and Friends, a Vancouver-based outlet, did uncredited work.[2][58] Nelvana faced several problems with their Korean contractors,[30] among them the language barrier between the Canadian crew and the overseas staff,[30] and the unwieldy processes through which the film reels were shipped to the West.[59] At one point, Loubert, Smith, and fellow staffer David Altman spent three days trying to persuade several unpaid animators to return important layout sketches. In exchange for the layouts, Nelvana gave them US$20,000 in Korean won.[60] By then, the production was falling behind schedule, and an opening date was already set; Loubert sent half of the work to Taiwan (where Lenora Hume supervised), while the remainder stayed in Korea under Loubert's and Smith's watch.[61] | Back in the Americas, Hirsh tried to promote the unfinished feature before its deadline; unable to get available footage, he instead managed to show potential marketers some Leica reels and a few moments of completed colour animation.[62] According to him, it was the first time an animated \"work in progress\" was screened to exhibitors; this ploy has since been used by the Disney company,[62] particularly in the case of Beauty and the Beast (at the 1991 New York Film Festival).[63] \"People loved the movie anyway,\" he said of this experiment. \"I was told it was considered great salesmanship. It made [them] feel that they were part of the process because they were seeing unfinished work.\"[62] |  | United States: | Kid Stuff Records | DAR 3901 (LP) / DT 4901 (Cassette)[64] | United Kingdom: | Cherry Lane Records | Lou Adler | John Sebastian | Walt Woodward | The music for The Care Bears Movie was composed by Patricia Cullen.[2][46] The soundtrack album was released in LP and cassette format by Kid Stuff Records in the United States,[65][66] and on Cherry Lane Records in the United Kingdom.[67] Six songs were performed by Carole King, John Sebastian, NRBQ, and the Tower of Power;[2] actor Harry Dean Stanton had a guest appearance as Brave Heart Lion for the song \"Home is in Your Heart\".[2] The songs were produced by Lou Adler and John Sebastian, with additional lyrics and music by Ken Stephenson, Walt Woodward, and David Bird;[2] Nelvana crewmember Peter Hudecki prepared the song sequences.[2] | Before The Care Bears Movie, Sebastian contributed to several other Nelvana specials, including The Devil and Daniel Mouse (1978). When asked to compose three tracks for the film, he learned about the characters since he was unfamiliar with the franchise. Despite his misgivings on the marketing aspects, Sebastian said in April 1985, \"I think their central theme—being candid about your feelings, sharing your feelings—is a very positive message for children.\"[68] | Adele Freedman of Toronto's The Globe and Mail wrote positively about the music in the film: | A lot of caring has gone into the soundtrack. It doesn't attack the eardrum in the manner of so much current kids' stuff. It supposes that a child's ear can discriminate between good music and aural pollution as well as anybody else's. Carole King (of Tapestry fame) wrote and performed the theme song, \"Nobody Cares Like A Bear\". [sic] The remaining songs, written by John Sebastian, are likewise entertaining and imaginatively arranged. The music does a lot to make the kingdom of Care-a-lot, where the goody-goody bears hang out on clouds monitoring life below on their Caring Meter, a slightly less irritable place.[11] | Other critics tended to differ. The Houston Chronicle's Stephen Hunter found that \"the film integrates its music into the story very clumsily. It's not merely that the numbers are forgettable—they are—it's that they're shoe-horned so obviously into the story that they don't amplify it, they stop it cold.\"[69] Likewise, Michael Blowen of The Boston Globe said that \"the uninspired songs ... add nothing to the banal plot.\"[70]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Arna Selznick","m_produced_by":"Michael Hirsh Patrick Loubert Clive A.

One of the first films based directly on a toy line, it introduced the Care Bears characters and their companions, the Care Bear Cousins.[nb 2] In the film, orphanage owners tell a story about the Care Bears, who live in a cloud-filled land called Care-a-Lot. Travelling across Earth, the Bears help two lonely children named Kim and Jason find new parents, and also save a young magician's apprentice named Nicholas from an evil spirit's influence. Deep within a place called the Forest of Feelings, Kim, Jason, and their friends soon meet another group of creatures, the Care Bear Cousins. | American Greetings Corporation, the owners of the Care Bears characters, began development of a feature film in 1981. Later on, the card company chose Toronto's Nelvana to produce it, granted them rights to the Care Bears characters, and financed the film along with cereal manufacturer General Mills and television syndicator LBS Communications. Nelvana's founders were on hand as producers, while fellow employee Arna Selznick directed. Production lasted eight months, cost no less than US$2 million, and took place in Canada, Taiwan, and South Korea. The voice cast included Mickey Rooney, Georgia Engel, Jackie Burroughs and Cree Summer. Two pop music stars, Carole King and John Sebastian, contributed several songs. | Although major US studios passed on the project, newly established independent distributor The Samuel Goldwyn Company acquired it and soon spent a record US$24 million promoting it. The film premiered on March 24, 1985, in Washington, D.C. and entered wide release in around 1,000 North American theatres five days later.[nb 3] Another Nelvana work, Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins, played alongside the feature in theatres. The Care Bears Movie received mixed reviews from the outset; critics raised concern over its potential as a full-length advertisement for the title characters, among many other aspects. It went on to earn US$23 million domestically; as Canada's highest-grossing film during 1985 (with C$1.845 million), it won a Golden Reel Award. Nelvana's surprise hit also played in Europe, Australia, and Latin America. With over US$34 million in worldwide sales, it set a box-office record for Canadian and non-Disney animation, and has remained one of US distributor Goldwyn's largest releases. | The movie's success saved Nelvana from closing, helped revive films aimed at children in the US market, and has been cited as inspiring a spate of toy-based animated and live-action features. Nelvana produced two sequels in the next two years, A New Generation (1986) and Adventure in Wonderland (1987); neither surpassed the original financially or critically. The Care Bears franchise continues, and has included television series and specials, videos, and films. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"Beck, Jerry (2005). The Animated Movie Guide.
