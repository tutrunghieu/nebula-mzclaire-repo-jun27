{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story is set in 1892 in and around the small peaceful (fictional) farming village of Dolwyn in Mid-Wales. | A massive dam and reservoir to supply water to Liverpool has been constructed at the head of the valley above Dolwyn, but construction has stopped because of geological difficulties; what was thought to be limestone is actually granite. Realising that a cheaper and easier scheme would involve the flooding of the village (but unaware that the village was inhabited), Lord Lancashire, the scheme's promoter, dispatches an agent, Rob, to visit the village and buy the land. | Rob persuades a reluctant, and debt-ridden, Lady Dolwyn to sell the land, and also offers the leaseholders large sums for their leases. They are also offered new houses in a Liverpool suburb and jobs in a cotton mill for those who want them. Rob has his own reasons for wanting the village flooded; he is a native of Dolwyn, but was stoned out of it twenty years before for thievery. He therefore hates and despises the villagers, who are actually oblivious to his shameful past and bear him no ill will. | Whilst preparing to pack up and leave, Gareth (played by Richard Burton), who has also lived in England and is more conversant with the language, discovers documents that prove his foster-mother, Merri (who has very little English), has a right to own her land in perpetuity. A solicitor confirms this title. | Lord Lancashire himself visits Merri, but soon realises that this simple village woman cannot be bought off or cajoled. To top it all, she is able to cure his rheumatic shoulder with simple manipulation. He decides to leave the village alone and use the more expensive and difficult method of construction. Rob is furious and decides to open the dam's spillway valves to flood the valley. He is unable to do so and instead decides to set fire to Merri's cottage. | He is confronted by Gareth and a fight ensues. Rob is knocked down by Gareth and he falls into the fire he planned to use for his devilish work. He dies of a heart attack. Merri has witnessed the events and is horrified. Determined that the killing shall not be discovered, she conceals the body in her cottage, then makes her way to the dam's valve room and opens the valves. | The villagers watch sadly from nearby safe ground as their beloved village is slowly drowned. One young shepherd has refused to flee the flood and his defiant, lilting tenor voice is suddenly silenced as the tide consumes him. Thus is fulfilled the message of a short prelude to the film showing a plaque marking the flood and the deaths of two people, only one of whose bodies was recovered.","m_cast":"Edith Evans – Merri | Emlyn Williams – Rob | Richard Burton – Gareth | Anthony James – Dafydd | Allan Aynesworth – Lord Lancashire | Barbara Couper – Lady Dolwyn | Andrea Lea – Margaret | Hugh Griffith – The Minister | Maurice Browning – Huw | Rita Crailey – Hen Ann | Eileen Dale – Mrs. Ellis | David Davies – Septimus | Frank Dunlop – Ephrain | Kenneth Evans – Jabbez | Patricia Glyn – Dorcas | Joan Griffiths – Eira | Sam Hinton – Idris | Dafydd Havard – Will | Roddy Hughes – Caradoc | Madoline Thomas – Mrs. Thomas | Sybil Williams | Tom Jones – John Henry","m_reception":"The film performed disappointingly at the box office despite good reviews.[6]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Russell Lloyd Emlyn Williams","m_produced_by":"Anatole de Grunwald","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Edith Evans Emlyn Williams Richard Burton Anthony James","m_music_by":"John Greenwood","m_cinematography":"Otto Heller","m_edited_by":"Russell Lloyd Maurice Rootes","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"British Lion Films","m_release_dates":"13 April 1949[1]","m_running_time":null,"m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"£96,772 (UK)[2] | The Last Days of Dolwyn (renamed Women of Dolwyn for the American market)[3] is a 1949 British drama film directed by Russell Lloyd and Emlyn Williams and starring Edith Evans, Emlyn Williams, Richard Burton and Anthony James.[4] The screenplay focuses on a Welshman, who has done well in London, who returns home planning to flood the village he grew up in—setting up a conflict between residents who are spiritually attached to the place and the values of the majority for whom money is a more persuasive force. | The film marked the first film appearance of Burton, the first film appearance of Edith Evans since 1916, and the sole film to be directed by Emlyn Williams, who also wrote the screenplay. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949) at IMDb | ^ Vincent Porter, 'The Robert Clark Account', Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Vol 20 No 4, 2000 p489 | ^ 'The Last Days Of Dolwyn' 1949 at The Richard Burton Museum | ^ The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949) at British Film Institute website | ^ Abandoned Communities...Reservoirs of Wales at abandonedcommunities.co.uk | ^ John Healey (6 December 1952). \"A reject worth waiting for\".
