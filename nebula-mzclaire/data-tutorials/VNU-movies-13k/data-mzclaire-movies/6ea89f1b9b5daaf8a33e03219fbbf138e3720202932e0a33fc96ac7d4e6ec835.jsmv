Rather than developing an interest in the successful son of her neighbors, Toby Walling (Adam Brody), which would please both families, it is her parents' best friend David who captures Nina's attention. When the connection between Nina and David is discovered, everyone's lives are thrown into upheaval, particularly Vanessa Walling's (Alia Shawkat), Nina's childhood best friend.

This fulfills something within myself that I could never find in my series [Gossip Girl].\"[10] Even though Alia Shawkat's name was the first mentioned by the casting director, Farino met with a lot of actresses for the role of Vanessa.[7] Shawkat met Farino a year before she auditioned where he told her that they were considering Ellen Page for the part. After Page turned it down, Shawkat auditioned twice and was cast.[12] Allison Janney and Olvier Platt had also worked together before in the television series The West Wing,[13] while Catherine Keener and Platt had starred in the movie Please Give.[14] | The ending was rewritten before shooting.[12] During filming, Laurie, Meester, Janney, Platt, and Brody shared a house together.[10] While the film is set in the fall, from Thanksgiving to Christmas in New Jersey, principal filmography started at the end of March 2010 in the upscale Beechmont section of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York and lasted 29 days.[1][5][15] Scenes were also shot in the neighboring Westchester communities of Mamaroneck and Bronxville, as well as the Tropicana Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.[16] The film was shot with Red cameras.[17] The narration was provided by Shawkat's character Vanessa whose voice-over was recorded in post-production during the editing of the film.[12][18] ATO Pictures acquired the rights of distribution in September 2011.[19]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Julian Farino","m_produced_by":"Anthony Bregman | Leslie Urdang | Dean Vanech","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Alia Shawkat","m_music_by":"Klaus Badelt | Andrew Raiher","m_cinematography":"Steven Fierberg","m_edited_by":"Jeffrey M.
