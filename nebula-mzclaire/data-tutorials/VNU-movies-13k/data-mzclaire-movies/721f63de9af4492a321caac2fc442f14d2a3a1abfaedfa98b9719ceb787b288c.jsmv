For Cagney, this was his only film appearance,[4] whereas Montgomery appeared in four other films and a half-dozen television episodes.[5]","m_reception":"Although not a major box-office success, The Gallant Hours was well received by film critics, with Bosley Crowther writing in his review for the New York Times: | Crowther also singled out Dennis Weaver, Ward Costello, and James T. Goto for their performances.[16] Biographer John McCabe also praised Cagney's portrayal: | TV Guide gave The Gallant Hours a three-star rating, noting: \"James Cagney was the perfect choice to play Admiral Halsey.\" It also praised Robert Montgomery's direction that \"focuses on the human side of the war, taking the time to show the inner workings of a great leader. The going is a little slow for what was thought to be a \"war\" movie, but it is this leisurely pace that makes the film all the more believable.\"[18]","m_production":"Director Robert Montogomery had served under Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., as a Commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and he came up with the idea of making a film about Halsey when he attended the 75th birthday celebration honoring the Admiral in 1957. Montgomery and his good friend James Cagney acquired the rights to Halsey's life story later that year, and they formed a production company, Cagney-Montgomery Productions, to make the film. Montgomery had started directing on 1945's They Were Expendable, substituting for John Ford when Ford was ill, and made his credited directorial debut in 1947 with Lady in the Lake. He had also produced for television before, but The Gallant Hours was the first feature film he both directed and produced. It turned out to be his last involvement of any kind in film and television as a producer, director, or actor. Cagney's foray into production was also his first, and his last. | Under his contract agreement with Cagney-Montgomery Productions, Admiral Halsey would receive 10 percent of the profits from the motion picture. During a visit with his son, William F. Halsey III, in La Jolla, California, Admiral Halsey went to Camp Pendleton where The Gallant Hours was being filmed (pictured). William F. Halsey III later remarked that he was startled at how much James Cagney looked like his father did during World War II.[6] | The voiceover narration technique Montgomery utilized was similar to what he had done in Lady in the Lake, although in that case the narration was in the first person. What is striking about the narrative in The Gallant Hours is the degree of detail provided to introduce both main and minor characters to the audience, even sometimes indicating the manner of their death in the near future. Also unusual is that both American and Japanese characters are treated in a neutral and evenhanded way. | The production team utilized the services of three technical advisors in making the film – Captain Joseph U. Lademan, Captain Idris Monahan, and James T. Goto, who not only was the Japanese advisor but also portrayed Admiral Yamamoto in the film.[7] | For James Cagney, The Gallant Hours was \"a labor of love, a tribute to that wonderful man Admiral William F. \"Bull\" Halsey\" for himself and his long-time friend Robert Montgomery. Cagney praised Montgomery because he \"steered away from big battle scenes and roaring guns. We concentrated on Halsey himself, trying to convey some of the tension of high command\" in the film.[8] | In researching his role as Halsey, Cagney interviewed many men who had served under the Admiral, including two interviews with the admiral himself, but he found the role a difficult one, despite the physical similarities between the two men. Cagney was very concerned that he not impose any of his usual acting mannerisms on the character of Halsey – on the other hand, despite having met his subject several times, he didn't try to imitate Halsey's mannerisms either. As Cagney biographer John McCabe noted: \"The film would be utterly boring without Cagney's thoughtful performance. Nowhere in his career had he been called on to do so much by doing so little.\"[9] | There was one aspect of Halsey's personality neither the script nor Cagney touched on in any way: his reputation as a \"sea dog\", with \"a girl in every port\". Halsey's nickname \"Bull\" was supposedly conferred on him by his fellow officers not for his toughness in combat, but for his off-duty exploits ashore.[10] | The Gallant Hours was Cagney's last starring role in a dramatic film. Thereafter he starred in a comedy, One, Two, Three, in 1961, and appeared briefly in Ragtime in 1981. | The Gallant Hours was filmed in black & white at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in the spring of 1959,[11] with some exterior scenes shot in San Diego.[12] The film employed a new construction technique to make the interior battleship shots easier to light: the sets were hung from overhead grids to enable them to swing in and out as needed.[13] Working titles for the film were \"Bull Halsey\" and \"The Admiral Halsey Story\". | It had its world premiere in Washington, D.C. on 13 May 1960, sponsored by the Navy League, and was released generally on 22 June 1960 in New York City.[14][15]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Montgomery","m_produced_by":"James Cagney Robert Montgomery","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Robert Montgomery Art Gilmore","m_music_by":"Roger Wagner Ward Costello (theme song)","m_cinematography":"Joseph MacDonald","m_edited_by":"Fredrick Y.
