However, as an attempt to get behind the filter of the main stream media – as a picture of reality unmediated by editorial commentary – it’s a more potent negation of Michael Moore, Craig Unger, Noam Chomsky and Co.\"[9] | The New York Times: \"If this film cannot claim to represent the political \"truth\" about the war - what film could?\"[10] | Variety: \"As a true or accurate portrait of the real Iraq, however, pic pales in comparison to various in-depth U.S. and European reports, and to Bahman Ghobadi's brilliant new drama on wartime Kurdish refugees, \"Turtles Can Fly.\"\"[11] | The Village Voice: \"any film that credits itself as \"filmed and directed by the people of Iraq\" deserves to be regarded with skepticism.\"[12] | Detroit Free Press: \"a revealing documentary that depicts the day-to-day hopes and grief of people. Mothers talk about sons gone missing. Interviews are interrupted by bomb explosions. Kids practice in a rock band after listening to black-market Metallica CDs.

What was your main mission in creating this film?\" Eric Manes responded, \"Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group of people who have been silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country.\" When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, \"We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230.\" \"Our budget came out to around $500,000.
