{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) is released from prison with a set of drums and a new outlook on life, and returns to his run-down neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. A drug addict (the drug is never named, but heroin is strongly implied), Frankie became clean in prison. On the outside, he greets friends and acquaintances. Sparrow (Arnold Stang), who runs a con selling homeless dogs, clings to him like a young brother, but Schwiefka (Robert Strauss), whom Frankie used to deal for in his illegal card game, has more sinister reasons for welcoming him back, as does Louie (Darren McGavin), Machine's former drug dealer. | Frankie returns home to his wife Zosh (Eleanor Parker), who is supposedly wheelchair-bound after a car crash some years earlier that was caused by Frankie driving drunk. Zosh is secretly fully recovered, but pretends to be unable to walk in order to keep making Frankie feel guilty so he will stay with her. Frankie comments on the whistle she wears around her neck, a device she used in Frankie's absence to summon a neighbor, Vi (Doro Merande), when needed. With Frankie home, Zosh smothers her husband in their small tenement apartment and hinders his attempt to make something of himself. He thinks he has what it takes to play drums for a big band. While calling to make an appointment, he bumps into an old flame, Molly (Kim Novak) who works in a local strip joint as a hostess and lives in the apartment below Frankie's. Unlike Zosh, Molly encourages his dream of becoming a drummer. | Frankie soon gets himself a tryout and asks Sparrow to get him a new suit, but the suit is a stolen one and he ends up back in a cell at a local Chicago Police Precinct. Schwiefka offers to pay the bail. Frankie refuses, but soon changes his mind when the sight of a drug addict on the edge becomes too much for him. Now, to repay the debt, he must deal cards for Schwiefka again. Louie is trying to hook him on drugs again, and with no job and Zosh to please, pressure is building from all directions. | Soon Frankie succumbs and is back on drugs and dealing marathon, all-night, card games for Schwiefka. Molly sees he is using drugs again and runs away from him. He gets a tryout as a drummer, but spends 24 hours straight dealing a poker game. Desperately needing a fix, Frankie follows Louie home, attacks him, and ransacks his house, but can't find his drug stash. At the audition, with withdrawal coming on, Frankie can't keep the beat and ruins his chance of landing the drumming job. When Louie goes to see Zosh to try to find Frankie, Louie discovers that Zosh has been faking her paralysis and can walk. Zosh, scared of being found out, pushes Louie over the railing of the stairwell to his death, but things backfire when Frankie is sought for Louie's murder. | Initially not realizing he is a suspect in Louie's death, Frankie goes to Molly hoping to get money for a fix. After learning that Captain Bednar and the police are looking for him, Molly convinces Frankie that he must go cold turkey if he is to stand a chance with the police. Frankie agrees and is locked in Molly's apartment where he goes through a grueling withdrawal to clear the drugs from his body. Finally clean again, he tells Zosh he is going to leave her, start anew and stand trial. In her desperation to keep Frankie from leaving her, Zosh once again gives herself away, standing up in front of Frankie and the police. She runs, but can get no farther than the outside balcony. Trapped, she blows the whistle and throws herself off the balcony to her death. A police ambulance then arrives to remove Zosh's lifeless body and drives away, while Frankie watches in dismay. He then walks away, with Molly following.","m_cast":"Frank Sinatra as Frankie \"Dealer\" Machine | Eleanor Parker as Zosh | Kim Novak as Molly Novotny | Arnold Stang as Sparrow | Darren McGavin as \"Nifty Louie\" Fomorowski | Robert Strauss as Zero Schwiefka | John Conte as Drunkie John | Doro Merande as Vi | George E.

Clinical in its probing of the agonies, this is a gripping, fascinating film, expertly produced and directed and performed with marked conviction by Frank Sinatra as the drug slave.\"[19][20]","m_production":"Screen rights to Algren's novel were first acquired in 1949 on behalf of John Garfield, who planned to star in the film version. However, production was delayed because the Production Code Authority (PCA) refused to approve the script, with Joseph Breen stating that the basic story was \"unacceptable\" because of the Code's prohibition on showing illegal drug trafficking and drug addiction. The ability to obtain PCA approval was critical because at that time, many movie theaters would not show films that had not received approval. The PCA further predicted that the subject would also be unacceptable to the National Legion of Decency (a Catholic film censor board), Federal authorities, and state and local censor boards in the United States and abroad. Garfield died in 1952 and director Otto Preminger acquired the rights from his estate.[3] | Preminger had previously released The Moon Is Blue (1953), which succeeded at the box office despite being denied the Production Code seal of approval due to its sexual subject matter.[5] He told Peter Bogdanovich why he was attracted to Algren's novel: \"I think there's a great tragedy in any human being who gets hooked on something, whether it's heroin or love or a woman or whatever.\"[7] Although United Artists (UA) had a distribution contract with Preminger, a clause in the contract allowed them to withdraw if a film failed to get Code approval. Preminger stated that in that event, he would set up his own company to handle distribution of The Man With The Golden Arm. Preminger continued to have problems with the PCA during the making of the film.[3] | Although the novel's author, Nelson Algren, was initially brought to Hollywood to work on the screenplay, he and Preminger did not get along, and he was quickly replaced by Walter Newman.[8][9] Preminger and Newman went on to make significant changes to Algren's original story,[10] and the film was eventually released as \"A Film By Otto Preminger\".[11] In 1956, Algren sued Preminger and others seeking an injunction to keep Preminger from claiming authorship of the film, but had to drop the suit because he could not afford the legal fees.[11] | Frank Sinatra jumped at a chance to star in the film before reading the entire script. The script was given to Marlon Brando around the same time as Sinatra, who still harbored some anger at Brando for beating out Sinatra for the lead role in On the Waterfront.[12] To prepare for his role, Sinatra spent time at drug rehabilitation clinics observing addicts going cold turkey.[13] He also learned to play drums from real-life drummer Shelly Manne.[3] The picture was shot in six weeks at RKO Studios in Hollywood from September 26 through November 4, 1955.[14] | Saul Bass designed the crooked arm symbol used in the film's advertising campaign, which Preminger liked so much that he threatened to pull the picture if an exhibitor changed the advertisements. Bass also created the animated title sequence for the film, the first of many such sequences that he went on to create for films by Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, and others.[15]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Man with the Golden Arm 1949 novel  by Nelson Algren","m_directed_by":"Otto Preminger","m_produced_by":"Otto Preminger","m_screenplay_by":"Walter Newman Lewis Meltzer Ben Hecht (uncredited)","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Frank Sinatra Eleanor Parker Kim Novak Arnold Stang Darren McGavin","m_music_by":"Elmer Bernstein","m_cinematography":"Sam Leavitt","m_edited_by":"Louis R.

Although the addictive drug is never identified in the film, according to the American Film Institute \"most contemporary and modern sources assume that it is heroin\", in contrast to Algren's book which named the drug as morphine.[3] The film stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin. It was adapted for the screen by Walter Newman, Lewis Meltzer and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and directed by Otto Preminger.[4] The film's initial release sparked controversy due to its serious, in-depth treatment of the then-taboo subject of drug addiction.[3][5] | It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Sinatra for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Joseph C.
