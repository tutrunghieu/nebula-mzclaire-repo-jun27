Jennie and Ah Jong begin to fall in love during his frequent visits at her apartment. Driven to help her secure the money for a sight-saving corneal transplant, he accepts one final hit. A police detective, Li Ying, spots Ah Jong completing the job but the assassin escapes. The Triad leader Hay Wong Hoi double crosses Ah Jong, and instead of paying him, sends a group of hitmen to kill him. During Ah Jong's escape from the Triad, a young child is injured by a stray bullet. After dispatching the attackers, Ah Jong rushes the child to the hospital while being followed by Li and his partner Sgt. Tsang.

He and Tsang find that Ah Jong visits Jennie at her apartment; they plan to arrest him the next time he visits her. Ah Jong visits Jennie and is caught in an ambush from which he manages to escape. Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his Triad manager, Fung Sei (Chu Kong), and demands his payment for the job. Fung Sei brings a suitcase for Ah Jong, who discovers it to be filled with sheets of blank paper before finding himself in the middle of a Triad ambush. He kills all of the hitmen, but leaves Fung Sei alive. The next day, after Fung Sei's pleas for Wong Hoi fall on deaf ears, Ah Jong does a hit-and-run on Wong Hoi's car, wounding the Triad leader and killing his driver and bodyguard. | Li begins to close in on Ah Jong after Tsang follows Fung Sei; Tsang is killed after revealing the location of his home. Because of their friendship, Fung Sei leaves a large stockpile of weaponry for Ah Jong. The home is another ambush; Li attacks, followed by a group of Triad hitmen. Li gets caught in the middle of the crossfire between Ah Jong and the Triad. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong tells Li that should anything happen to him, Li should have Ah Jong's eyes donated for Jennie's surgery or use Ah Jong's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors. Li, Ah Jong, and Jennie wait in a church for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong's money. Fung Sei arrives with the money, horribly beaten by Wong Hoi's gangsters who have followed him. He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church. After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei's misery, he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with the Triad all over the church. The battle ends with a Mexican standoff between Ah Jong, Li and Wong Hoi.

Stephen Holden of The New York Times referred to the film as \"Alternately gripping and laughable\" and that \"The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong's fog-shrouded skyline\".[61] Variety gave a positive review, describing the film as a \"extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight grasp that director John Woo has on the crime meller genre\".[62] Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it \"defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been anything like this before.\"[63] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as \"like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel...[Woo's] ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie\".[64] The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that \"This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style\".[65] | Later critiques of the film remained positive. The Washington Post stated that \"the plot doesn't exactly break new crime-story ground. It's all the Woo flourishes...that elevates The Killer to another level\".[55] Lucia Bozzola of the online film database Allmovie gave the film a five star rating, and stated it as \"One of the high points of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema\".[66] Empire gave the film five stars and proclaimed that \"John Woo's trademark style reached its zenith in The Killer\".[58] In 2010, Time Out New York ranked The Killer at number 50 on their list of the top 50 foreign films of all time.[67] As of 2014, The Killer is one of the several films to maintain a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[68] In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.[69] The Killer was listed at 24th place on this list.[70] | I went to the movies to see John Woo's The Killer. Damn. I wish we had more money for squib effects (bullet hits). | The Killer is an important and influential film for both Western and Asian filmmakers.[72] Film scholars have noted the similarities between Woo's style and The Killer with the films Nikita (1990) and Léon (1994) directed by French director Luc Besson.[72][73] Kenneth E. Hall described Léon as having the similar character configuration of a hitman and the person he protects.[72] In Nikita, the main character's crisis of conscience after performing a number of hits is also seen in The Killer.[74] Lucy Mazdon described the style of Nikita as recalling \"the work of directors like John Woo. Like Nikita, Woo's films show alienated and often brutal characters and graphic violence\".[73] In the United States, directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino developed films that were influenced by The Killer.[75][76] Rodriguez's films El Mariachi (1992) and Desperado (1995) contain stylistic homages to The Killer.[72] In the film Jackie Brown, Tarantino wrote dialog referencing The Killer. No references to the film are made in the original novel.[14] Asian-based directors were also influenced by the film. Hong Kong director Johnnie To borrows from The Killer's gunfighting style, oppositional character pairing, and parody in his films A Hero Never Dies, Running Out of Time, and Fulltime Killer.[77][78] | The Killer was also influential on hip hop music. American hip hop artist, and Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically praised debut album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995) that sampled numerous portions of dialog from the film.[79][80][81][82] RZA, the producer of the album described the album's themes by stating that \"Rae and Ghost was two opposite guys as far as neighborhoods was concerned, I used John Woo's The Killer. [In that movie] you got Chow Yun Fat [playing the role of Ah Jong] and Danny Lee [Inspector Li]. They have to become partners to work shit out.\"[79] Woo felt honored that the group sampled The Killer and asked for no monetary return from them.[79] In 2005, Vibe magazine placed The Killer at number 20 on their list of top fifty films that shaped hip hop.[83]","m_production":"The Killer was director Woo's follow-up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which was released in 1987. The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio[24] so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo.[25] According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief.[5][26] When Woo proposed the story of The Killer to Tsui Hark, it was denied; Hark's reaction was that \"[n]obody wants to see a film about a killer\".[27] | The Killer was not able to be filmed until actor Chow Yun-fat stepped in and enlisted the company he was contracted with, Golden Princess Film, to fund part of the project.[24] Chow had worked previously with Woo on the two A Better Tomorrow films. Woo wanted Danny Lee to play Li Ying, but Lee was under an exclusive contract with Cinema City and was only able to work on The Killer if his production company, Magnum, was involved.[24][28] John Woo approached his friend, Sally Yeh, asking her to be in a film to play an important female character. Yeh was currently contracted with Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance.[29] The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director. Chu Kong was a friend of Chow Yun-fat who had entered retirement and returned to acting in The Killer as a favor.[24][24][30] Two of Woo's close friends joined the cast: actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong.[24] Wong Wing-Hang was hired to be the director of photography for The Killer but had to leave the set for an extended period of time, so Peter Pau was added to shoot the rest of the film.[24] | Woo had over 90 days to shoot The Killer which was nearly double the amount of time that the average Hong Kong film was shot in the late 1980s.[31] Woo went into filming with only a short treatment for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming.[30] During promotion periods for the film, Woo described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean-Pierre Melville.[7] Woo cites Melville's Le Samouraï as an influence on the story. Woo borrows plot elements for the film, including the set-up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer.[32] Woo also described the influence of a Japanese film, Narazumono, about a killer (Ken Takakura) who only kills delinquents. When a mob tricks him into killing an innocent person, he swears revenge but then meets a woman who has tuberculosis and wants to go home. The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge.[33] | The scene where Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay and the crew only had three hours to film. Residents thought it was a real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the superintendent so they could continue filming.[30] Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck.[30] The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport.[30] The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot.[30] The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church.[30] The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.[34] | Tsui and Woo disagreed on the musical aspects of the film. For the opening scene, Woo wanted the singer to perform a jazz song and have the killer playing a saxophone. Tsui rejected this idea as he felt that the Hong Kong audiences did not understand or like jazz. Woo stated that he \"had to change it to a Chinese song, the kind of song they always use in Hong Kong movies.\"[35][36] Actress Sally Yeh who performed the Cantopop songs did not feel they were appropriate for the film. The songs were requested by the studio and written specifically for The Killer.[24][29] | The film's music was composed by Lowell Lo and edited by David Wu.[37] A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting vibraphone theme which is first heard over the opening credits.[38] The harmonica motif in the film was influenced by the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, specifically the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in America, and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect. David Wu said the influence of the Harmonica music in Sergio Leone's western films was a strong influence on his work.[37] During the final action scene when the statue of the Virgin Mary is destroyed, the action music transitions to \"Overture\" from Messiah by George Frideric Handel. This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence.[39]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Woo","m_produced_by":"Tsui Hark","m_screenplay_by":"John Woo","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Chow Yun-fat | Danny Lee | Sally Yeh | Chu Kong | Kenneth Tsang | Shing Fui-On","m_music_by":"Lowell Lo","m_cinematography":"Peter Pau | Wong Wing-Hang","m_edited_by":"Fan Kung-Ming","m_production_company":"Film Workshop[1]","m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"6 July 1989 (1989-07-06) (Hong Kong) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes[3]","m_country":"Hong Kong","m_language":"Cantonese","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"HK$18.255 million | The Killer (simplified Chinese: 喋血双雄; traditional Chinese: 喋血雙雄; Jyutping: dip6 hyut3 soeng1 hung4; pinyin: Diéxuè shuāngxióng[4])† is a 1989 Hong Kong action film written and directed by John Woo, and starring Chow Yun-fat, Danny Lee and Sally Yeh. Chow plays the assassin Ah Jong, who accidentally damages the eyes of the singer Jennie (Sally Yeh) during a shootout. He later discovers that if Jennie does not have an expensive operation she will go blind. To get the money for Jennie, Ah Jong decides to perform one last hit. | After the financial backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following the release of Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets, and Narazumono. Woo desired to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese. | The Killer was not an immediate success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim in the Western world with reviewers praising the action scenes and its over-the-top style. The film became Woo's stepping stone to make Hollywood films and has been a strong influence on many directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Johnnie To. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"Elder, Robert K.
