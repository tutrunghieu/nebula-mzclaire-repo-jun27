He praised Paul Mazursky for some of his earlier works but Canby did not like this film, and wrote, \"Tempest is an overblown, fancified freak of a film. Experiencing it is like watching a 10-ton canary as it attempts to become airborne. It lumbers up and down the runway tirelessly, but never once succeeds in getting both feet off the ground at the same time. The spectacle is amusing in isolated moments but, finally, exhausting.\"[4] | The film was a box office flop. | Wins | Toronto International Film Festival: People's Choice Award, Paul Mazursky; 1982. | Venice Film Festival: Pasinetti Award - Best Actress, Susan Sarandon; 1982. | Nominations | Golden Globe Awards: Golden Globe; Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Raul Julia; New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture - Female, Molly Ringwald; 1983. | Young Artist Awards: Best Young Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, Sam Robards; Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, Molly Ringwald; 1983.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the play The Tempest  by Wm.
