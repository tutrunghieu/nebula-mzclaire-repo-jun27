{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is a wealthy Main Line Philadelphia socialite who had divorced C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), a member of her social set, because he did not measure up to her exacting standards, due to his alcoholism and Tracy's lack of faith in him, which exacerbated his condition. She is about to marry nouveau riche \"man of the people\" George Kittredge (John Howard). | Spy magazine publisher Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell) is eager to cover the wedding, and he enlists Dexter, one of his former employees, to introduce reporter Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor (James Stewart) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) as friends of Tracy's brother Junius, so they can report on the wedding. Tracy is not fooled but reluctantly agrees to let them stay—after Dexter explains that Sidney has an innuendo-laden article about Tracy's father, Seth (John Halliday), who, she believes, is having an affair with a dancer. Though he is separated from her mother, Margaret (Mary Nash), and Tracy harbors great resentment against him, she wants to protect her family's reputation. | Dexter is welcomed back with open arms by Margaret and Dinah (Virginia Weidler), Tracy's teenage sister, much to her annoyance. In addition, she gradually discovers that Mike has admirable qualities, and she even takes the trouble to find his published stories in the library. Thus, as the wedding nears, she finds herself torn between George, Dexter, and Mike. | The night before the wedding, Tracy gets drunk for only the second time in her life and takes an innocent swim with Mike. When George sees Mike carrying an intoxicated Tracy into the house afterward, he thinks the worst. The next day, he tells her that he was shocked and feels entitled to an explanation before going ahead with the wedding. She takes exception to his lack of faith in her and breaks off the engagement. Then she realizes that all the guests have arrived and are waiting for the ceremony to begin. Mike volunteers to marry her (much to Liz's distress), but she graciously declines. At this point, Dexter makes his bid for her hand, which she accepts.","m_cast":"Cary Grant as C.K.

If it doesn't play out this year and well along into next they should turn the Music Hall into a shooting gallery...Metro and Director George Cukor have graciously made it apparent, in the words of a character, that one of 'the prettiest sights in this pretty world is the privileged classes enjoying their privileges.' And so, in this instance, will you, too.\"[20] | The film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The consensus reads, \"Offering a wonderfully witty script, spotless direction from George Cukor, and typically excellent lead performances, The Philadelphia Story is an unqualified classic.\"[21] The site also ranked it as the Best Romantic Comedy of all time.[22] | The film was the last of four starring Grant and Hepburn, the others being Sylvia Scarlett (1935), Bringing Up Baby (1938), and Holiday (1938). All but Sylvia Scarlett belong to a subgenre of screwball comedy called the comedy of remarriage described by the philosopher Stanley Cavell as Hollywood's crowning achievement.","m_production":"\"Everyone had enormous fun on the movie. The days and nights were sweltering that summer of 1940, but nobody cared. Cary got along very well with Kate Hepburn. She enjoyed him pushing her through a doorway in one scene (so she fell over backward) so much that she had him do it to her over and over again. There was a scene in which she had to throw Cary out the door of a house, bag and baggage, and she did it so vigorously he fell over and was bruised. As he stood up, looking rueful, Kate said, \"That'll serve you right, Cary, for trying to be your own stuntman.\" | Broadway playwright Barry[10] wrote the film specifically for Hepburn, who ended up backing the play, and forgoing a salary in return for a percentage of its profits.[11] Costarring with Hepburn on Broadway were Joseph Cotten as Dexter Haven, Van Heflin as Mike Connor, and Shirley Booth as Liz Imbrie.[4] | Hoping to create a film vehicle for herself which would erase the label of \"box office poison\" that the Independent Theatre Owners of America had put on her after a number of commercial failures (including the classic Bringing Up Baby), Hepburn happily accepted the film rights to the play from Howard Hughes who had bought them for her. She then convinced MGM's Mayer to buy them from her for only $250,000 in return for Hepburn having veto over producer, director, screenwriter and cast.[8][11][12] | Hepburn selected director George Cukor, in whose films A Bill of Divorcement (1932) and Little Women (1933) she had acted, and Donald Ogden Stewart, a friend of Barry's and a specialist at adapting plays to the big screen, as writer.[11] | Hepburn wanted Clark Gable to play Dexter Haven and Spencer Tracy to play Mike Connor, but both had other commitments. Grant agreed to play the part on condition that he be given top billing and that his salary would be $137,000, which he donated to the British War Relief Society.[13] The pairing of Cukor and Gable would have been problematic in any case, as they had not gotten along on the recent Gone with the Wind, and Cukor had been replaced with Victor Fleming.[14] | The film was in production from 5 July to 14 August 1940[15] at MGM's studios in Culver City.[16] It was shot in six weeks and came in five days under schedule.[8] At one point, Stewart slipped in his hiccuping during the drunk scene. Grant turned to him, surprised, and said \"Excuse me,\" then appears to stifle a laugh. The scene was kept and was not reshot.[17] | Stewart had been extremely nervous about the scene in which Connor recites poetry to Tracy and believed that he would perform badly. Noël Coward was visiting the set that day and was asked by Cukor to say something to encourage him. Stewart was also quite uncomfortable with some of the dialogue, especially in the swimming pool scene. | Hepburn performed the dive into the swimming pool entirely by herself without the help from doubles. Forty years later, during the filming of On Golden Pond, Jane Fonda was frightened to do her own dive, to which the annoyed Hepburn responded, \"I did my own dive in The Philadelphia Story.\" | The film premiered in New York City in the week of 27 December 1940 and it was shown in select theatres in December, but MGM had agreed to hold its general release until January 1941 in order not to compete with the stage play,[8] which was no longer playing on Broadway, but was touring the country.[4] It went into general American release on 17 January 1941.[18] It broke a box office record at Radio City Music Hall by taking in $600,000 in just six weeks.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Philadelphia Story 1939 play  by Philip Barry","m_directed_by":"George Cukor","m_produced_by":"Joseph L.

Based on the Broadway play of the same name by Philip Barry,[4] the film is about a socialite whose wedding plans are complicated by the simultaneous arrival of her ex-husband and a tabloid magazine journalist. The socialite character of the play—performed by Hepburn in the film—was inspired by Helen Hope Montgomery Scott (1904–1995), a Philadelphia socialite known for her hijinks, who married a friend of playwright Barry.[5] | Written for the screen by Donald Ogden Stewart and an uncredited Waldo Salt, it is considered one of the best examples of a comedy of remarriage, a genre popular in the 1930s and 1940s, in which a couple divorce, flirt with outsiders and then remarry – a useful story-telling ploy at a time when the depiction of extramarital affairs was blocked by the Production Code. | The film was Hepburn's first big hit following several flops, which had led to her being included on a 1938 list that Manhattan movie theater owner Harry Brandt compiled of actors considered to be \"box office poison.\"[6] She acquired the film rights to the play, which she had also starred in, with the help of Howard Hughes,[7] in order to control it as a vehicle for her screen comeback.[8] According to a Turner Broadcasting documentary MGM: When the Lion Roars, after MGM purchased the film rights they were skeptical about Hepburn's box office appeal, so Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Louis B. Mayer took an unusual precaution by casting two A-list male stars (Grant and Stewart) to support Miss Hepburn. | Nominated for six Academy Awards, the film won two; James Stewart for Best Actor and Donald Ogden Stewart for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was remade in 1956 as a musical, retitled High Society. | The Philadelphia Story was produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1995. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c \"The Eddie Mannix Ledger\".
