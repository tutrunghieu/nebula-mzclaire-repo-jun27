{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in 1950s Tunisia, the film is about a 25-year-old woman, Alia, who returns to her place of birth—a prince's palace in which her mother, Khedija, worked as a house servant and mistress.[3] Alia had fled the palace ten years earlier, at which time she spent burying totured memories of her childhood.[4] In her visit to pay respects for the death of the prince, Alia wanders through the largely abandoned palace where she is confronted by these memories represented as detailed flashbacks of her childhood. She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistant questioning about her father's identity.[4][5] As Alia negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have what seems to be yet another abortion.[4] [1] Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.[1]","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Moufida Tlatli","m_produced_by":"Canal Horizon Cinétéléfilms Mat Films","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Amel Hedhili Hend Sabri Najia Ouerghi Sami Bouajila Kamel Fazaa Fatima Ben Saïdane Kamal Twatti","m_music_by":"Anouar Brahem","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Moufida Tlatli","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Amorces Diffusion Capitol Entertainment","m_release_dates":"7 September 1994 (1994-09-07) (France) | 4 September 1994 (1994-09-04) (Canada) | 30 September 1994 (1994-09-30) (U.S.) |  | ","m_running_time":"128 minutes","m_country":"Tunisia","m_language":"Arabic French | The Silences of the Palace (Tunisian Arabic: صمت القصور, Samt el qusur‎) is a 1994 Tunisian film co-written written and directed by Moufida Tlatli. The film investigates issues of gender, class and sexuality in the Arab world through the lives of two generations of women at a prince's palace. Seen through the eyes of an attractive young wedding singer, it exposes the sexual and social servitude of a group of women in an elaborate palace during the French Protectorate in Tunisia.[1] Tlatli wrote the film in response to her own mother's sudden severe illness and her subsequent realization of how little she knew about her life.
