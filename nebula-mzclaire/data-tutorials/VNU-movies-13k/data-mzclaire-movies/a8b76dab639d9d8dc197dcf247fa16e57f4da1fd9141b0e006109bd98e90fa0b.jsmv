{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Three men meet in a foxhole during the waning days of World War I: Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney), George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), and experience trials and tribulations from the Armistice through the passage of the 18th Amendment leading to the Prohibition period of the 1920s and the violence which erupted due to it, all the way through the 1929 stock market crash to its conclusion at the end of 1933, only days after the 21st Amendment brought an end to the Prohibition era. | Following World War I, Lloyd Hart starts his law practice, George Hally, a former saloon keeper, becomes a bootlegger, and Eddie Bartlett, a garage mechanic, finds his old job filled. At the suggestion of his friend Danny Green (Frank McHugh), Eddie becomes a cab driver. While unknowingly delivering a package of liquor to Panama Smith (Gladys George), he is arrested. Panama is acquitted and after a short stint in jail, they go into the bootlegging business together. Eddie uses a fleet of cabs to deliver his liquor, and he hires Lloyd as his lawyer to handle his legal issues. He re-meets Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane), who is now an adult - a girl he formerly corresponded with during the war while she was in high school - working at a nightclub. Eddie gives her a job singing in Henderson's cabaret, where Panama is hostess. Eddie wants Jean as his wife, but she does not return his affections. | Eddie and his henchmen hijack a shipload of liquor belonging to fellow bootlegger Nick Brown (Paul Kelly) who had refused to cooperate with him. In charge of the liquor shipment on board is George who proposes to Eddie to bring him in as a partner. Eddie agrees, and back home they tip off the Feds of a liquor shipment of Brown's that is then confiscated. Eddie, George, and their henchmen raid the Fed's warehouse stealing the liquor. As they are leaving, George recognizes one of the watchmen as his former sergeant that he disliked and murders him. After learning of the murder, Lloyd quits while being threatened by George. In time, as the bootlegging rackets prosper, Eddie sends Danny to arrange a truce between him and Brown, but Danny's life-less body is dropped off in front of The Panama Club. Eddie and his henchmen plan a surprise visit to Brown's establishment, but George, resentful with Eddie's increasing power, tips off Brown, who sets a trap. A gunfight ensues, and Eddie kills Brown while escaping. Figuring out George's duplicity, he dissolves their partnership. | While being in love with Jean, Eddie catches Jean and Lloyd together. Subsequently, after speculating in the stock market, Eddie's bootlegging empire crumbles in the 1929 crash. He sells his fleet of cabs to George, who mockingly leaves Eddie one to drive, like the cab he drove at the end of the Great War after losing his job at the garage. As by chance one day, Jean steps into Eddie's cab. Eddie is upset at her for leaving him for Lloyd, so he's standoffish. Jean invites him back to her house to help Lloyd with a problem that he has with George. Now in the District Attorney's office, Lloyd has received a death threat from George unless he stops working on the case to convict George as his crimes have caught up to him. Eddie is introduced to their 4 year-old son, but is noncommittal He agrees to be friends with them and leave it at that. | Jean tries a second time to ask Eddie for help. She locates him at a bar with Panama. After appealing to a drunken Eddie, he agrees to go to George's house. While there, Eddie is mocked again by George for his shabby looks and cannot convince him to lay off Lloyd. This results in a shootout in which Eddie kills George (\"Here's one rap ya' won't beat...\") and some of his men, redeeming himself. After running outside, he is shot in the back by another cohort, and collapses on the steps of a nearby church. As the police arrest the remainder of George's gang, Panama runs to Eddie, and being interviewed by a cop while she cradles Eddie's lifeless body, she informs the officer, \"He used to be a big shot.\"","m_cast":"Uncredited Cast","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Gladys George had replaced Ann Sheridan who had replaced Lee Patrick who had replaced Glenda Farrell for the character of Panama Smith. | Anatole Litvak was the original director.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The World Moves On (1938)  by Mark Hellinger","m_directed_by":"Raoul Walsh","m_produced_by":"Hal B.
