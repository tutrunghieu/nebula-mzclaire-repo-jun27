{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set Ireland in the early 1960s in the small town of Clones. Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens) is a 12-year-old boy whose imagination is fuelled by television - aliens, communists, the Atomic Age.[3] When his mother (Aisling O'Sullivan) suffers a nervous breakdown and ultimately commits suicide, he is left in the care of his father (Stephen Rea), an emotionally distant and ill-tempered alcoholic. Francie spends most of his time with his best friend Joe Purcell (Alan Boyle) talking about \"gangsters, cowboys and Indians, comic-book monsters and the early-1960s threat of nuclear annihilation.\"[4] However, when Francie's growing conflict with another boy, Phillip Nugent (Andrew Fullerton), and his mother (Fiona Shaw) begins to go too far, he ends up at reform school. Here, he is molested by a priest (Milo O'Shea), and finds solace only in his fantasies about a foul-mouthed Virgin Mary (Sinéad O'Connor). He returns home to find Joe has outgrown him and befriended Phillip Nugent. Before long, his father has drunk himself to death. Faced with being left completely alone in the world, Francie loses his grip on reality and lashes out with uncontrollable brutality, which shocks his provincial hometown.[2]","m_cast":"Eamonn Owens as Francie Brady | Stephen Rea as Benny Brady (Da) | Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Nugent | Andrew Fullerton as Phillip Nugent | Aisling O'Sullivan as Annie Brady (Ma) | Alan Boyle as Joe Purcell | Seán McGinley as Sergeant | Ian Hart as Uncle Alo | Brendan Gleeson as Father Bubbles | Milo O'Shea as Father Sullivan | Sinéad O'Connor as Virgin Mary / Colleen | Gina Moxley as Mary | John Kavanagh as Doctor Boyd","m_reception":"The reception of the film has been generally good. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes show a 79% rating and an average rating of 7.5/10.[5] Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment says \"Neil Jordan's sweetly tragicomic movie\" has \"elaborate fantasy sequences [that] feel like irrelevant amusements.\" He also praises the film as \"a compelling exploration of the permeable border between normal childhood and full-on insanity.\"[4] Jeffrey M. Anderson at Combustible Celluloid calls the film \"a roller-coaster ride for your brain. It's the most alive and deeply-felt movie I've seen in 1998.\"[6] Emanuel Levy at Variety says it is \"Neil Jordan's most accomplished and brilliant film to date.\"[5] | Owens' performance was hailed unanimously; as such, he was awarded a Special Mention at the Berlin Film Festival in 1998. | The cumulative box office according to Variety is $1,963,654.[1]","m_production":"This was the final film produced by Geffen Pictures, which distributed its films through Warner Bros. Geffen Pictures would be sold to Universal Studios years later. | The screen rights to the book were bought by Neil Jordan in 1992 during the filming of Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles.[3] The adaptation is mostly faithful to the novel, but there are some differences, the principal change being the ending. In the book, Francie is not seen to leave prison, and attempts to forge a friendship with an inmate similar to the one he had with Joe. In the film, a much older Francie is released from prison at the end to be brought to a halfway house. He picks a snowdrop, echoing the opening of the film. | Casting the child to play Francie was difficult. With no previous filming experiences, Eamonn Owens and Alan Boyle (who played Francie's best friend, Joe) were found at the local school in Killeshandra in County Cavan where casting assistant Maureen Hughes went to visit her uncle. Owens' younger brother Ciaran was also cast. Jordan cast O'Connor because \"she looks like the Virgin Mary.\"[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Butcher Boy  by Patrick McCabe","m_directed_by":"Neil Jordan","m_produced_by":"Redmond Morris Stephen Woolley","m_screenplay_by":"Patrick McCabe Neil Jordan","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Stephen Rea Fiona Shaw introducing Eamonn Owens","m_music_by":"Elliot Goldenthal","m_cinematography":"Adrian Biddle","m_edited_by":"Tony Lawson","m_production_company":"The Geffen Film Company","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"13 July 1997 (1997-07-13) (Ireland) | 20 February 1998 (1998-02-20) (UK) | 3 April 1998 (1998-04-03) (US) |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes","m_country":"Ireland United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$1,963,654[1] | The Butcher Boy is an 1997 Irish tragicomic drama film adapted to film by Neil Jordan and Patrick McCabe from McCabe's 1992 novel of the same name.[2] | Set in the early 1960s, The Butcher Boy is about Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens), a 12-year-old boy who retreats into a violent fantasy world to escape the reality of his dysfunctional family; as his circumstances worsen, his sanity deteriorates and he begins acting out, with increasing brutality.
