{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2011, Anse Rainier (Gary Richardson), an American professor at Lahore University, is kidnapped soon after he leaves a movie theatre. A ransom video is sent to the US embassy, demanding the release of 690 detainees from a Muslim concentration camp in Kot Lakhpat and €700,000 for the children of Waziristan. Bobby Lincoln (Liev Schreiber), an American journalist and undercover CIA informant in Pakistan, arranges to interview a colleague of Rainer, Changez Khan (Riz Ahmed), who he suspects is involved in the kidnapping. | Changez starts off the interview, held in a café, by declaring his admiration for the American equal playing field in economic advancement. He belongs to a class of people who, while genteel and educated, increasingly find themselves left out of economic progress. His father is an elderly poet and man of letters (played by Om Puri), who is respected by all who know him. Nevertheless, money has always been a serious problem in the family and Changez was only able to attend college when he got a scholarship to Princeton University. After graduation, he earned a job position at a top Wall Street valuation firm, Underwood Samson. Meanwhile, he met a young American photographer, Erica (Kate Hudson), and a relationship developed. | The World Trade Center attacks takes place when Changez was in Manila on business. When he returns to the USA, he is strip-searched at the airport in New York. Later on, he was thoroughly interrogated by federal agents, after being mistakenly arrested in the street as he just left the Underwood Samson building. His attitude toward the USA seems to change, as his relationship with Erica, who has yet to come to terms with the loss of her former boyfriend, feeling responsible for his death. Changez eventually breaks up with her, after she invites him at the opening of her art show: she had used intimate details of their relationship without his knowledge, which he took as a betrayal | While valuating a publishing house in Istanbul, Changez discovered that the otherwise worthless firm had translated some of his father's work into Turkish and published them. He realized that the company had preserved culture, something that cannot be measured merely in terms of money. His boss at Underwood Samson, Jim Cross (Kiefer Sutherland), did not see it that way, viewing Changez's attitude as unprofessional. Feeling an ever increasing conflict between his desire of success and his sense of loyalty, between the way he saw himself and the way he was now treated, Changez finally resigned from Underwood Samson. | During his interview with Lincoln, Changez says that at one point he was approached by a terrorist cell and asked to become a mujahid, and he was tempted to accept, feeling deeply angered and disillusioned by \"the arrogance, the blindness, the hypocrisy\" of the USA, but he finally refused when he was told about the \"fundamental truths\" of the Q'uran, echoing a phrase Jim Cross had used during their first encounter, \"focusing on the fundamentals\". Elaborating on the similarities, he explains that both groups, Islamic fundamentalists and blind capitalist economy represented by Underwood Samson, share the same reductionist outlook, view people in binary terms, thus feeling entitled to get rid of those deemed unworthy. | Being a foreigner without a job, and with his work visa set to expire in two weeks, he returned to Lahore (Pakistan), where he found that foreign professors were leaving the university en masse. He was hired as a lecturer. He voiced dissatisfaction with US intrusions in Pakistan, and this brought him to the attention of the authorities as a suspected Al-Qaida member. They raided his office and family home and threatened his family. | Back to present day, while Lincoln and Changez talk in the café, protestors gather outside, and Lincoln gets periodic pressure from the CIA to get information from Changez about the location of the kidnapped Rainier. The protests become increasingly hostile, and Changez says he has heard of a butcher shop. Contact is lost before the information can be phoned to the CIA operatives who are working with Lincoln. | Lincoln becomes suspicious seeing Changez texting, the latter saying he was just communicating with his sister, Bina (Meesha Shafi); suspicions turn to fury after Lincoln receives a picture of Rainer dead, mistakenly linking the two events. Lincoln believes the only way to safety is to use Changez as a shield venturing into the hostile crowded street. Attempts are made to keep the crowd stable but things get worse and Lincoln falls to the ground, his gun goes off and hits Sameer (Imaad Shah), one of Changez's student interns, who dies from the wound. Another student fires at Lincoln from a balcony, after which Lincoln is quickly removed by CIA agents. Lincoln then finds out that Rainer was in fact found dead earlier that day, and that Changez had indeed rejected working with the suspected mastermind behind the kidnapping, Mustafa Fazil; he also told the truth about the text message. | Changez delivers a eulogy at Sameer's funeral, as Lincoln recuperates in a hospital, recalling Changez's words as he listens to the recording of the interview - \"Looks can be deceiving. I am a lover of America... although I was raised to feel very Pakistani.\"","m_cast":"Riz Ahmed as Changez Khan.[10] | Kate Hudson as Erica.[11] | Liev Schreiber as Bobby Lincoln.[12][13] | Kiefer Sutherland as Jim Cross.[14] | Om Puri as Abu, Changez's father.[15][16] | Shabana Azmi as Ammi, Changez's mother.[17] | Meesha Shafi as Bina Khan, Changez's sister.[18] | Martin Donovan as Ludlow Cooper, a CIA officer and investigator.[19] | Adil Hussain as Mustafa Fazil, a Muslim Activist and Mujahid. | Imaad Shah as Sameer, an academic intern at Lahore University.[20] | Chandrachur Singh as Bandy Uncle.[21] | Ashwath Bhatt as Junaid | Haluk Bilginer as Nazmi Kemal | Nelsan Ellis as Wainwright | Christopher Nicholas Smith as Mike Rizzo | Victor Slezak as Underwood | Clayton Landey as Agent Jackson | Mark Oliver as an Immigration Officer | Steven Kulesza as Shredder #1 | Kevin Miller as Shredder #2 | Javed Basu-Kesselman as Pakistani James Bond[22] | Sonya Jehan as Nadia | Gary Richardson as an American professor","m_reception":"The Reluctant Fundamentalist earned $30,920 in its opening weekend in limited release in the United States, and went on to gross a total of $528,731.

The website reported critical consensus as: \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist is technically proficient with solid acting and cinematography” yet \"its message is so ambitious and heavy-handed that some of its power is robbed.\"[37] Vaihayasi Pande Daniel for Rediff.com gave 3.5/5 stars and says \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist has its cinematic moments but is too simplistic in places\".[38] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, the film has ratings score of 54, based on 28 reviews, classified as a generally favorably reviewed film.[39] Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian gave it 3/5 stars and commented, \"Its message might be flabby, but Mira Nair's adaptation of Mohsin Hamid's novel is still a bold piece of global storytelling\".[40] Rummana Ahmed from Yahoo! Movies gave a score of 4/5 and said, \"Mira Nair takes on the daunting task of adapting Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist and skillfully transforms a monologue into an engaging plot. She weaves an elaborate tale, infusing it with warmth and texture.\"[41] Damon Wise of Empire Magazine rated the film as 3/5 and said, \"Ahmed excels and the set-up is compelling but ultimately this is middle rank stuff from the Monsoon Wedding director\".[42] Mohar Basu of Koimoi also rated the film 3 out 5 and says: \"What’s Good: The film preserves the mood of Mohsin Hamid’s book well. What’s Bad: A jerky screenplay ruptures the film’s flow multiple times all through. Watch or Not?: Mira Nair’s repertoire glistening with gems like Namesake and Monsoon Wedding is enough to evoke interest. However, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is not even close to being among her best works. With issues left unexplored and characters abandoned abruptly, the film is a desirable watch only for the landmark performance of Riz Ahmed and the grace with which he builds his character.\"[43] | The Reluctant Fundamentalist won the Audience Favorite—World Cinema award at 2012 Mill Valley Film Festival, while Nair was honored with the Mill Valley Film Festival Award that year.[44][45] | The Reluctant Fundamentalist won the 1st Centenary Award at International Film Festival of India 2013.[46] | The Reluctant Fundamentalist won Truly Moving Picture Award at the 2013 Heartland Film Festival.[47] | In 2013, Nair won The Bridge, the German Film Award for Peace,[48] for The Reluctant Fundamentalist.
