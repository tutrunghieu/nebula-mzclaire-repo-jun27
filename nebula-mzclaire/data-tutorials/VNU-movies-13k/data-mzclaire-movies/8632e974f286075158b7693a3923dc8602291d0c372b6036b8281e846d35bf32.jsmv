{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A married couple, Simon and Robyn Callem, relocate from Chicago to a Los Angeles suburb after Simon takes a new job. While out shopping, they run into Gordon \"Gordo\" Moseley, Simon's former high school classmate. Gordo begins dropping in unannounced and delivering gifts including koi for their pond. He makes Simon uncomfortable, but Robyn sees no problem. | Gordo invites the couple to his large and elegant home. He receives a phone call and leaves abruptly, making Simon more suspicious. When he returns, Simon tells him to stay away from his family. The next day, Robyn finds the koi dead and their dog missing. Simon drives to Gordo's house to confront him, but discovers it is not actually his home. In the days following, Robyn suspects she is not alone in the house while Simon is at work. Unable to sleep, she steals prescription pills from her neighbor and one morning faints. | The dog returns and Robyn receives a letter of apology from Gordo; she is puzzled by his writing that he is \"willing to let bygones be bygones\". Simon says he does not know what it refers to and refuses to make peace with Gordo, telling Robyn that her pills are making her paranoid. | Robyn becomes pregnant. At her baby shower, Simon's sister tells her that, at school, Simon and his friend Greg reported that Gordo was being molested. Gordo was bullied afterwards and had to transfer. Robyn finds Greg, who reveals that the molestation story was fabricated by Simon, who was a bully in school; as a result of the story, Gordo's father thought he was homosexual and nearly killed him. Robyn searches Simon's home office and discovers that he has run background checks on Gordo and someone named Danny McDonald. | Robyn learns Simon has beaten Danny for a promotion after troubling information was revealed from Danny's previous job. Robyn confronts Simon about Gordo, but he denies responsibility. At Robyn's behest, Simon tracks down Gordo and half-heartedly apologizes, but Gordo does not accept his apology. Furious, Simon attacks him. | Simon's promotion party is interrupted by Danny, who says Simon fabricated the information that ruined his career. Robyn goes into labor and gives birth to a boy. The next morning, Simon receives a call from his boss telling him that he has been accused of fraud and will be fired. Robyn tells him she wants a separation. | Simon goes home and finds another gift box, containing footage of Gordo preparing to sexually assault Robyn after she fainted months earlier. Meanwhile, Gordo visits Robyn in the hospital to congratulate her, bearing an arm in a sling; he tells her Simon injured him. Simon rushes to the hospital and Robyn tells him she wants a divorce. He receives a call from Gordo, who taunts him and refuses to confirm whether he actually attacked Robyn or who the baby's father is. Simon breaks down; Gordo watches through the window of a nearby door, then walks away, removing his arm sling.","m_cast":"Jason Bateman as Simon Callem[6] | Rebecca Hall as Robyn Callem[7] | Joel Edgerton as Gordon \"Gordo\" Mosley[8] | Tim Griffin as Kevin \"KK\" Keelor | Allison Tolman as Lucy[9] | Beau Knapp as Detective Walker | P.J.
