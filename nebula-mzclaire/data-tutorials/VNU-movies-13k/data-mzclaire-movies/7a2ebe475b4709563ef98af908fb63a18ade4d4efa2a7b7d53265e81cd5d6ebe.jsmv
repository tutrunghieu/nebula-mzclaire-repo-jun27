{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After his aircraft company's groundbreaking work on jet engine technology in the Second World War, John Ridgefield (Ralph Richardson), its wealthy owner, employs test pilot Tony Garthwaite (Nigel Patrick), a successful wartime fighter pilot to fly new jet-powered aircraft. Garthwaite is hired by Ridgefield after marrying Ridgefield's daughter, Susan (Ann Todd). Tensions between father and daughter are accentuated by Garthwaite's dangerous job of test flying. In a noteworthy illustration of the new technology, Susan accompanies Garthwaite on a ferrying assignment of a two-seater de Havilland Vampire to Cairo, Egypt, returning later the same day as passengers on a de Havilland Comet. | Ridgefield's hopes for his new jet fighter, \"Prometheus\",[Note 1] has placed the company in jeopardy. The problems faced by the then-new jet aircraft in encountering the speed of sound, the so-called \"sound barrier\" are ever present. In an attempt to break the sound barrier, Garthwaite crashes and is killed. Shocked at the death of her husband and her father's single-minded and heartless approach to the dangers his test pilots face, Susan walks out on her father and goes to live with Jess (Dinah Sheridan), the wife of Philip Peel (John Justin), another company test pilot. Ridgefield approaches Peel, encouraging him to continue with the challenge of piloting his test aircraft. In one crucial flight, and at the critical moment, engaging in a counterintuitive action, Peel reverses his flight controls, allowing his aircraft to break the sound barrier. | Accepting that her father cared about those whose lives were lost in tests, Susan changes her plan of moving to London and takes her young son with her back to home and Sir John.","m_cast":"As appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):[4]","m_reception":"The Sound Barrier, in its guise as Breaking the Sound Barrier was reviewed by Bosley Crowther in The New York Times. Typical of the many positive reviews, he said, \"... this picture, which was directed and produced in England by David Lean from an uncommonly literate and sensitive original script by Terence Rattigan, is a wonderfully beautiful and thrilling comprehension of the power of jet airplanes and of the minds and emotions of the people who are involved with these miraculous machines. And it is played with consummate revelation of subtle and profound characters by a cast headed by Ralph Richardson, Nigel Patrick, and Ann Todd.\"[26] | Film historian Stephen Pendo further described the \"... brilliant aerial photography. ... Along with the conventional shot of the aircraft there is some unusual creative camera work. To illustrate the passage of a plane, Lean shows only the wheat in a field being bent by air currents produced by the unseen jet. ... Even the cockpit shots are very good, with the test pilots in G-suits and goggles framed by the plexiglass and sky backgrounds.\"[20] | The Sound Barrier was the 12th most popular movie at the British box office in 1952,[27] and also did well in the United States, making a comfortable profit.[1] Later releases in both VHS and DVD home versions have taken place.","m_production":"The strong relationship to aviation history in The Sound Barrier has led to its being characterised as a \"semi-documentary\".[5] The film pays tribute to the British effort in the historic advance in aviation of the development and final perfecting of the jet engine by Frank Whittle and Power Jets Ltd and others following.[6][7] | David Lean had begun to gather research based on media reports of jet aircraft approaching supersonic speeds, interviewing British aeronautic designers. He even managed to fly with test pilots as he produced a 300-page notebook that he turned over to playwright Terence Rattigan.[8] The subsequent screenplay concentrated on the newly discovered problems of flying at supersonic speeds. The screenplay is also loosely based on the real-life story of aircraft designer Geoffrey de Havilland and the loss of his son (Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr.), the de Havilland company's test pilot who died attempting to fly faster than sound in the DH 108.[9][10] | Contrary to what is depicted in the film, the first aircraft to break the sound barrier was the rocket-powered Bell X-1 flown by Chuck Yeager of the United States Air Force in 1947. [Note 2] As Yeager, who was present at the U.S. premiere, described in his first biography, The Sound Barrier was entertaining, but not that realistic – and any pilot who attempted to break the sound barrier in the manner portrayed in the film (the one action, forcing the centre stick \"forward\" to pull \"out\" of a dive) would have been killed.[14] [Note 3] Nevertheless, because the 1947 Bell X-1 flight had not been widely publicized, many who had seen The Sound Barrier thought it was a true story in which the first supersonic flight is made by British pilots.[16][17][18] | With studio filming at Shepperton Studios, Lean also deployed to Chilbolton Aerodrome, Nether Wallop, Hampshire, for the flying sequences under the direction of Anthony Squire. A Vickers Valetta and Avro Lancaster bomber served as camera platforms for the aerial sequences.[Note 4]With the cooperation of the British Aircraft Constructors Association, aircraft that were featured in The Sound Barrier were on loan from Vickers, de Havilland and other British aerospace companies.[20] In addition, footage of early 1950s jet technology in Great Britain used in the film includes scenes of the de Havilland Comet airliner, the world's first jet passenger airliner,[21] the Supermarine Attacker and the de Havilland Vampire. The Supermarine Swift which was featured as the experimental Prometheus jet fighter was one of the Swift prototypes (VV119). Not unlike its screen persona, the Swift was also a particularly troublesome aircraft design that underwent teething developmental trials.[22][Note 5] | Malcolm Arnold (later Sir Malcolm Arnold) composed the music score, his first of three films with David Lean.[24] The two other collaborations were Hobson's Choice (1954) and The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957).[25]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Lean","m_produced_by":"David Lean","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ralph Richardson Ann Todd Nigel Patrick John Justin Denholm Elliott","m_music_by":"Malcolm Arnold","m_cinematography":"Jack Hildyard","m_edited_by":"Geoffrey Foot","m_production_company":"London Film Productions","m_distributed_by":"London Films British Lion Films United Artists","m_release_dates":"22 July 1952 (1952-07-22) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"118 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£250,000[1]","m_box_office":"£227,978 (UK)[2] | The Sound Barrier (aka in the United States, as Breaking Through the Sound Barrier and Breaking the Sound Barrier) is a British 1952 film directed by David Lean. It is a fictional story about attempts by aircraft designers and test pilots to break the sound barrier.
