{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"United States Naval Aviator LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer LT(RIO) Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the F-14A Tomcat aboard USS Enterprise (CVN-65). They, with Maverick's wingman \"Cougar\" and his RIO \"Merlin\", intercept fictional Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-28s over the Indian Ocean. During the engagement, Maverick flies his Tomcat parallel to one of the MiGs and inverts his craft in order to give the other pilot the finger – a feat that adds to his already wild reputation. Cougar is almost taken out by one of the hostile aircraft, however, and afterwards is too shaken to land despite being low on fuel. In defiance of orders, Maverick aborts his landing and assists Cougar despite also being low on fuel. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, CAG \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose—now his top crew—to attend the Top Gun school at NAS Miramar. | Maverick flies recklessly in part to compensate for his father Duke Mitchell, a Naval Aviator with VF-51 aboard the USS Oriskany (CV-34) during the Vietnam War. The elder Mitchell died when his F-4 Phantom II was shot down in an incident Maverick refuses to believe was his fault. Goose is cautious and devoted to his wife Carol and child. The two officers are nonetheless close friends and effective partners. At a bar the day before Top Gun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. He learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an astrophysicist and civilian Top Gun instructor. Upon learning that Maverick is the pilot who flipped off a MiG-28 pilot (and as a result disproved her data suggesting the MiG-28 was limited in performing a \"negative-G pushover\" due to a \"problem with its inverted flight tanks\"), she is instantly more interested in him. | Maverick's reckless flying both annoys and impresses LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly and other instructors. He defeats Jester in combat but breaks two rules of engagement in the process; becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazanski, who considers Maverick's methods \"dangerous\"; and continues to pursue Charlie. During class she analyzes Maverick's engagement with Jester's aircraft, calling it \"an example of what not to do\". Later, Charlie admits to him that she admires his tactics but criticized them to hide her feelings for him from the others, and they begin a romantic relationship. | During a training sortie Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Maverick matches the older pilot move for move, but Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester—who has already defeated Hollywood—can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual ability. | Near the end of the training program, Maverick and Iceman both chase Jester; the latter attempts to gain a missile lock on the target. Under pressure from Maverick, Iceman breaks off the engagement. Maverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, entering an unrecoverable flat spin, forcing him and Goose to eject. Goose is propelled into the jettisoned aircraft canopy, killing him instantly. | Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he feels guilty and loses his aggressiveness when flying. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. Unsure of his future, he seeks Viper's advice. Viper reveals that he served with Maverick's father in VF-51, and tells him classified details that prove Duke Mitchell died heroically. He informs Maverick that he can graduate from Top Gun if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, but Iceman wins the award for top pilot. | During the graduation party Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately report to Enterprise to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken communications ship that has drifted into hostile waters. Maverick and Merlin are assigned to one of two F-14s as back-up for those flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman they shoot down four MiGs and force the others to flee, and return triumphantly to Enterprise. Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Top Gun as an instructor. | At a bar at Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.","m_cast":"Tom Cruise as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell | Kelly McGillis as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood | Val Kilmer as LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazanski | Anthony Edwards as LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw | Tom Skerritt as CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf | Michael Ironside as LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly | John Stockwell as LT Bill \"Cougar\" Cortell | Barry Tubb as LTJG Leonard \"Wolfman\" Wolfe | Rick Rossovich as LTJG Ron \"Slider\" Kerner | Tim Robbins as LTJG Samuel \"Merlin\" Wells | Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as LTJG Marcus \"Sundown\" Williams | Whip Hubley as LT Rick \"Hollywood\" Neven | James Tolkan as CDR Tom \"Stinger\" Jardian | Meg Ryan as Carole Bradshaw | Adrian Pasdar as LT Charles \"Chipper\" Piper | Duke Stroud as Air Boss CDR Johnson | Linda Rae Jurgens as Mary Metcalf","m_reception":"The film opened in the United States in 1,028 theaters on May 16, 1986. It quickly became a success and was the highest grossing film of 1986. It was number one on its first weekend with a $8,193,052 gross, and went on to a total domestic figure of $176,786,701. Internationally it took in an estimated $177,030,000 for a worldwide box office total of $353,816,701.[24] | Upon the film's original release, critical response was mixed. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 54% of 48 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.8 out of 10 and the critical consensus states: \"Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aerial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren't in the air\".[25] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, pointing out that \"Movies like Top Gun are hard to review because the good parts are so good and the bad parts are so relentless. The dogfights are absolutely the best since Clint Eastwood's electrifying aerial scenes in Firefox. But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\"[26] | The film was nominated for and won many awards, most prominently for its sound and effects. The film won the following awards: | The film was nominated for the following awards: | Academy Awards (1987)[27] Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing – Cecelia Hall and George Watters II Best Film Editing – Billy Weber and Chris Lebenzon Best Sound – Donald O.

Film Editing – Billy Weber and Chris Lebenzon Achievement in Sound Achievement in Sound Effects | Movie producer John Davis claimed that Top Gun was a recruiting video for the Navy, that people saw the movie and said, \"Wow! I want to be a pilot.\" After the film's release, the US Navy stated that the number of young men who joined wanting to be Naval Aviators went up by 500 percent.[28]","m_production":"The primary inspiration for the film was the article \"Top Guns\" by Ehud Yonay, from the May 1983 issue of California magazine, which featured aerial photography by then-Lieutenant Commander Charles \"Heater\" Heatley.[3] The article detailed the life of fighter pilots at the Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, self-nicknamed as \"Fightertown USA\". Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project.[3] Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included an attendance at several declassified Top Gun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways.[4] | Actor Matthew Modine turned down the role of LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics.[5] | The producers wanted the assistance of the US Navy in production of the film. The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to Cuba, the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped.[6] Maverick's love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military's prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel.[3] The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to Christine \"Legs\" Fox, a civilian mathematician employed by the Center for Naval Analyses as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.[7] Rear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Top Gun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie's. | Former Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film's producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval aviator.[8] | The Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron VF-51 Screaming Eagles (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film. Paramount paid as much as $7,800 per hour for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties. Shots of the aircraft carrier sequences were filmed aboard the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), showing aircraft from F-14 squadrons VF-114 Aardvarks and VF-213 Black Lions.[9] The majority of the carrier flight deck shots were of normal aircraft operations and the film crew had to take what they could get, save for the occasional flyby which the film crew would request. During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost $25,000 to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier's captain a $25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.[10] | Most of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at NAS Fallon, in Nevada, using ground-mounted cameras. Air-to-air shots were filmed using a Learjet. Grumman, manufacturer of the F-14, was commissioned by Paramount Pictures to create camera pods to be placed upon the aircraft that could be pointed toward either the front or rear of the aircraft providing outside shots at high altitude.[citation needed] | Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a flat spin, which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his Pitts S-2 into the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast near Carlsbad on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl's body nor his aircraft were recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown.[11] Top Gun was dedicated to Scholl's memory.[12] | The Top Gun soundtrack is one of the most popular soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification[13] and #1 on the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart for five nonconsecutive weeks in the summer and fall of 1986.[14] Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on the films Flashdance and Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\", and \"Danger Zone\". Berlin recorded the song \"Take My Breath Away\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins's single \"Danger Zone\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone. On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis and \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" by The Righteous Brothers, were added. The soundtrack also includes \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Memories\" by Steve Stevens/Faltermeyer and Faltermeyer. However, no soundtrack release to date has included the full Faltermeyer score.[citation needed] | Other artists were considered for the soundtrack project but did not participate. Bryan Adams was considered as a potential candidate but refused to participate because he felt the film glorified war.[15] Likewise, REO Speedwagon was considered but backed down because they would not be allowed to record their own composition.[citation needed] The band Toto was originally meant to record \"Danger Zone\", and had also written and recorded a song \"Only You\" for the soundtrack. However, there was a dispute between Toto's lawyers and the producers of the film, paving the way for Loggins to record \"Danger Zone\" and \"Only You\" being omitted from the film entirely.[16]","m_sequel":"On October 13, 2010, New York magazine reported that Paramount Pictures had made offers to Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott to make a sequel to Top Gun. Christopher McQuarrie had also received an offer to write the sequel's screenplay, which was rumored to have Cruise's character Maverick in a smaller role.[42] When asked about his idea for a new Top Gun film, Scott replied, \"This world fascinated me, because it's so different from what it was originally. But I don't want to do a remake. I don't want to do a reinvention. I want to do a new movie.\"[43] | In December 2011, Tom Cruise stated that the sequel was in the works, and that he was in talks to reprise his role.[44] In March 2012, it was revealed by Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin F-35 program manager, that the F-35 Lightning II will be used and to be flown by Maverick as a test pilot in the sequel.[45] | On August 17, 2012, director Tony Scott and Tom Cruise met to scout locations in Fallon, Nevada for the sequel which was set to go into production in 2013 and expected for release in 2014. Jerry Bruckheimer would again produce and Peter Craig was in charge of writing script which is said to be nearly finished. According to reports, the plot of the movie would focus on the role of drones in modern aerial warfare.[46] | Since Scott's suicide, the sequel's future has remained in question. However, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has stated he \"hasn't given up\" on the sequel as all parties, including Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, are still interested in making the film. Mentioning he has wanted to make a sequel happen since the film came out 27 years ago, Bruckheimer confirmed the interest is still strong. \"It's just figuring out how to do it,\" Bruckheimer said, \"which I think we have a good handle on, and losing Tony slowed us down. But hopefully, we can pick up speed again.\"[47] | In June 2013, Bruckheimer stated that: \"For 30 years we've been trying to make a sequel and we're not going to stop. We still want to do it with Tom [Cruise] and Paramount are still interested in making it. What Tom tells me is that no matter where he goes in the world, people refer to him as Maverick. It's something he is excited about so as long as he keeps his enthusiasm hopefully we'll get it made.\"[48] | On September 8, 2014, Paramount and Skydance revealed being in negotiations to have Justin Marks write the screenplay.[49] In June 2015, while promoting Terminator Genisys, Skydance CEO David Ellison confirmed Marks was writing the screenplay, with the plot emphasizing \"drone technology and fifth generation fighters. It's really exploring the end of an era of dogfighting and fighter pilots and what that culture is today.\"[50] Kilmer posted on his Facebook page that he will be returning as Iceman.[51] | In April 2016, Marks told Creative Screenwriting that Top Gun 2 was a dream project for him, as Top Gun was the first movie he remembered seeing in theaters. \"Just researching the Joint Strike Fighters, the F-35, the different notions of where the Navy is today was a very interesting insight and it started to give me ideas of what Top Gun would represent in a current era.\"[52]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tony Scott","m_produced_by":"Don Simpson Jerry Bruckheimer","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tom Cruise | Kelly McGillis | Val Kilmer | Anthony Edwards | Tom Skerritt","m_music_by":"Harold Faltermeyer","m_cinematography":"Jeffrey L.
