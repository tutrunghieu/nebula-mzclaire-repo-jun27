{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the San Fernando Valley during the summer of 1962,[4] protagonist Scotty Smalls moves to a new town with his mother and Bill, his stepfather, and attempts to join a neighborhood baseball team who plays in a local sandlot. With the help of team captain Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez, known as Benny by the others, Scotty becomes a proficient player. Scotty joins his new friends on their many misadventures including being banned from the pool, besting a snooty long-time rival team, and getting sick on one of the rides at an amusement park. | He then learns that many of the team's baseballs have ended up in Mr. Mertle's junkyard over the sandlot's back fence, which is protected by a giant dog known as \"The Beast\", who had allegedly eaten a kid foolish enough to enter it. One day, when Benny hits the hide off of the team's last ball, Scotty substitutes one from his stepfather's prized collection. When this too is lost over the fence, Scotty reveals that the ball is special. To the team's horror, they learn the ball has Babe Ruth's autograph, making it valuable, but Scotty didn't know that at the time. The team constructs a progressively complex series of machines to recover it remotely, but each attempt ends in failure, while the ball itself grows increasingly damaged due to attention from the Beast.[5][6] | While Scotty prepares to face certain discipline from his stepfather for the loss of the signed baseball, Benny has a dream where Babe Ruth encourages him to follow his heart. Inspired by his idol, the next day, Benny climbs the fence, resolving to retrieve the ball himself, but he is confronted by the Beast, a large English Mastiff. After recovering the ball, he leads the Beast on a lengthy chase around the neighborhood, which ends with the sandlot fence's collapse, which pins the dog. Overcoming their fear of the dog, Scotty and Benny free the Beast, and return the dog to its owner, Mr. Mertle, who reveals that he wasn't the kind of person the team thought he was. Understanding Scotty's predicament with the now-damaged ball, Mr. Mertle reveals himself as a retired Negro League baseball player who knew Babe Ruth personally, and offers Scotty another baseball signed by the entire 1927 Yankees team, including Ruth. Scotty presents the baseball signed by the Murderers' Row to his stepfather. Even though Bill loves the Murderers' Row ball, he is still very mad about Scotty stealing the Babe Ruth autographed baseball and ruining it, and Scotty didn't feel too bad when Bill grounded him for only one week, instead of the rest of his life. | The sandlot kids continue playing baseball over the summers, joined by the Beast, now known by his real name of Hercules, as the team's mascot. | The kids eventually grow up, and Benny is revealed to have become a star MLB player (earning the nickname \"The Jet\"), while Scotty has become a sports announcer.[7]","m_cast":"Tom Guiry ... as Scotty Smalls | Mike Vitar ...

The site's consensus says \"It may be shamelessly derivative and overly nostalgic, but The Sandlot is nevertheless a genuinely sweet and funny coming-of-age adventure.\"[8] Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, comparing the movie to a summertime version of A Christmas Story, based on the tone and narration of both films. He said of one scene, \"There was a moment in the film when Rodriguez hit a line drive directly at the pitcher's mound, and I ducked and held up my mitt, and then I realized I didn't have a mitt, and it was then I also realized how completely this movie had seduced me with its memories of what really matters when you are 12.\"[9] Bob Cannon of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, praising its simplicity and strong fundamentals.[10] | Leonard Klady of Variety gave the film a mostly negative review. He praised the cinematography and score, but felt the baseball team did not come together, and that the film, while sincere, was \"remarkably shallow wade, rife with incident and slim on substance.\"[11] | The film grossed $4 million in its opening weekend and a further $32 million through ticket sales. Figures for worldwide VHS and DVD sales are estimated to be at $76 million. Since its release on both VHS and DVD, the film has become a cult favorite.[2] | In 1998, Michael Polydoros sued 20th Century Fox and the producers of the film for defamation. Polydoros, a childhood classmate of David Mickey Evans, the author and director of The Sandlot, claimed that the character Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous was derogatory and caused him shame and humiliation. The trial court found in favor of the filmmakers, and that finding was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal.[12] After initially agreeing to review the case in 1998,[13] the Supreme Court of California reversed its decision, dismissing the review and reinstating the Court of Appeal's opinion in favor of 20th Century Fox.[14][15] | In 1993, The Sandlot first came to video in a slipcase, along with the laser disc in widescreen, but later came in a clam shell case in 1994. On January 29, 2002, the DVD came in a Family Feature, in widescreen (Side B) and full screen (Side A). The 2013 repackaged DVD is only in widescreen.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"The Sandlot 2 (2005) – A direct-to-video sequel in which a new Sandlot gang is featured.
