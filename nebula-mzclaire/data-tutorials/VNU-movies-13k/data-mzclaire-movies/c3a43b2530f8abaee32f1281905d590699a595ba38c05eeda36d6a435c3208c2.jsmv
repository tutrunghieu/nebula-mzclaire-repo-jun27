It stars Michael Landon, Jack Hogan, and Jo Morrow. It was based on the 90-year-old folk song Tom Dooley, which had been inspired by the real-life case of convicted murderer Tom Dula. The ballad, as sung by the Kingston Trio, was a big hit in 1958 and is the theme song of the film.[1] The movie's plot is consistent with the lyrics of the song but otherwise bears little resemblance to the actual murder case. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://allmovie.com/work/the-legend-of-tom-dooley-99255","m_external_link":"The Legend of Tom Dooley at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Legendoftomdooley.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
