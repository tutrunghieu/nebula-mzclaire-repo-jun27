{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1891, Ben Talbot is killed by a fierce creature in the Blackmoor woods. Gwen Conliffe, Ben's fiancée, has contacted his brother Lawrence, a Shakespearean actor, saying that Ben disappeared. Lawrence returns to his family's estate in Blackmoor where he has an uneasy reunion with his estranged father, Sir John. Lawrence discovers Ben's mutilated body kept in a slaughterhouse. At the local pub, Lawrence overhears the locals discussing the killing. Many blame Gypsies who are camped outside the town, while another patron claims there was a similar murder several decades earlier and a werewolf was the suspected killer. He has flashbacks as he tours his family's home that his mother, Solana, committed suicide when he was a boy. Lawrence saw his father standing over her dead body; afterwards he was sent to an insane asylum in London for having to suffer from delusions. | Lawrence visits the Gypsies during a full moon. The local townspeople raid the camp to confiscate a dancing bear they believe is the killer, but a werewolf attacks the camp and bites Lawrence before being chased away by local hunters. A Gypsy woman named Maleva sutures his neck wounds, but her daughter insists the now cursed Lawrence should be killed before he destroys other lives. Maleva refuses, saying he is still a man and that only a loved one can release him. | Lawrence recovers unnaturally quickly, and develops heightened vitality and senses. His father's servant, Singh shows Lawrence a set of silver bullets and implies that something monstrous is loose in Blackmoor. Inspector Aberline arrives to investigate the recent killings, and suspects Lawrence is responsible based on his mental history and portrayals of mentally-ill characters. Lawrence sends Gwen away to London for her own safety. He follows his father to his mother's crypt, where Sir John locks himself in a room alone as he gives a cryptic warning to Lawrence. Lawrence then undergoes a painful transformation into the Wolfman before running off into the woods and killing the hunters stationed there. | Aberline and the police arrest the now human Lawrence. Taken to the same asylum he was committed to as a child, Lawrence is subjected to torturous treatments by Dr. Hoenneger. Sir John visits Lawrence and explains that many years before while hunting in India, he was bitten by a feral boy infected with lycanthropy. Lawrence realizes his father, as a werewolf, killed his mother and his brother. Knowing that Lawrence would never be believed, he confesses before leaving his son at the asylum permanently. | Dr. Hoenneger conducts an evening lecture with Lawrence as a case study and assures Lawrence that he is only a werewolf in his imagination, seeking to prove it by putting him on display during the full moon. As the full moon streams through the window, Lawrence transforms into the Wolfman and goes on a rampage throughout the lecture hall and London, with Aberline in pursuit. The next day, the now-human Lawrence goes to Gwen's antique shop for help. They realize they are falling in love and share a passionate kiss. Aberline arrives and searches the shop, but Lawrence has already escaped to Blackmoor. | Lawrence arrives at Talbot Hall and finds Singh's mutilated body. He loads a gun with Singh's silver bullets, but when he attempts to shoot his father, he learns that Sir John had removed the powder from the cartridges years ago. The Talbots fight, transforming into werewolves when the full moon rises and setting Talbot Hall on fire. Lawrence kills his father as Gwen and Aberline arrive. Aberline attempts to shoot the Wolfman, but is bitten instead. Gwen disrupts the shot and flees with Aberline's revolver. | The Wolfman pursues Gwen and traps her above a gorge. She pleads with Lawrence, whose consciousness recognizes her. As he hesitates, the hunters approach, distracting the Wolfman long enough for Gwen to shoot him. Lawrence reverts to human form, thanks Gwen for setting him free and dies in her arms. Aberline arrives with the hunters, but as he looks at the moon, he realizes his inevitable fate. | As Talbot Hall burns in the distance, a wolfman's howl is heard.","m_cast":"Benicio del Toro as Lawrence Talbot/The Wolfman | Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot | Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe | Hugo Weaving as Inspector Francis Aberline | Geraldine Chaplin as Maleva | Art Malik as Singh | Antony Sher as Dr. Hoenneger | David Schofield as Constable Nye | David Sterne as Kirk | Simon Merrells as Ben Talbot | Cristina Contes as Solana Talbot | Michael Cronin as Dr. Lloyd | Nicholas Day as Colonel Montford | Clive Russell as MacQueen | Roger Frost as Reverend Fisk | Max von Sydow appears as an elderly man who gives Lawrence the wolf-head cane; his part was cut from the theatrical film but is restored on the DVD release.[citation needed] Make-up artist Rick Baker makes a cameo appearance as the Gypsy man who is the first killed.[citation needed] The Wolfman's howl incorporated elements from rock singers Gene Simmons and David Lee Roth, as well as opera singers and animal impersonators.[citation needed] Voice actor Frank Welker performed the roars and growls of the werewolves and the feral boy.[5]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"In March 2006, Universal Pictures announced the remake of The Wolf Man with actor Benicio del Toro, a fan of the original and collector of Wolf Man memorabilia, in the lead role.[6][7] Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker was attached to the screenplay, developing the original film's story to include additional characters as well as plot points that would take advantage of modern visual effects.[8] Del Toro also looked towards Werewolf of London and The Curse of the Werewolf for inspiration.[9] | In February 2007, director Mark Romanek was attached to helm The Wolfman.[8] In January 2008, Romanek left the project because of creative differences.[10] Brett Ratner emerged as a frontrunner to replace Romanek, but the studio also met with Frank Darabont, James Mangold and Joe Johnston. They were also interested in Bill Condon, and Martin Campbell was interested.[11] Johnston was hired to direct on 3 February 2008, and the film's shooting schedule and budget remained as intended.[12] Johnston hired David Self to rewrite the script.[13] | Shooting took place from 3 March to 23 June 2008, in Britain.[14] At that time the film was budgeted at US$85 million.[10] They shot at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, Chatsworth in Derbyshire and Castle Combe in Wiltshire.[15] They transformed Chatsworth House by adding weeds, dead grass and ivy.[16] They also shot in Lacock in Wiltshire, a village conserved by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, for a day. Universal donated £5,000 to the village, in return for filming in the tithe barn for a scene involving frozen corpses.[17] A funeral scene was also shot beside the Temple of Ancient Virtue at Stowe House, with the temple coated in false ivy and copious amounts of smoke/mist floating over the setting. There were also scenes filmed on Dartmoor, Devon at Foggintor Quarry. Pick-ups at Pinewood were conducted in May 2009.[18] | Rick Baker created the make-up for The Wolfman. When he heard Universal was remaking the film, he eagerly pursued it, as both The Wolf Man and Frankenstein inspired him to become a make-up artist as a child. He acknowledged transforming del Toro was not difficult because he is a hairy man: \"Going from Benicio to Benicio as the Wolf Man isn't a really extreme difference. Like when I did An American Werewolf in London, we went from this naked man to a four-legged hound from Hell, and we had a lot of room to go from the transformation and do a lot of really extreme things. Here we have Benicio del Toro, who's practically the Wolf Man already, to Benicio del Toro with more hair and bigger teeth.\"[19] | Baker and del Toro were adamant about the design resembling the make-up created by Jack Pierce for the 1941 film, but Romanek went through thousands of concept art renderings. When Johnston signed on, Baker returned to his second design, which is the finished result.[20] The make-up took three hours to apply, and one hour to remove. New pieces of latex prosthetic makeup and loose hair was applied to del Toro's face each day, while several dentures and wigs were created in case some were damaged.[19] Baker said the transformation would likely be computer-generated, which disappointed him as he would not be involved and felt it would look unrealistic (as the animators did not have his knowledge of the design).[21] Director Joe Johnston explained that joining the film three weeks before photography placed limitations on his ability to film without using CG effects. He has stated, “I recognised that there were things that I was going to be able to do from the beginning to the end, and things that I had to rely on post-production for.\" In reference to filming Benicio del Toro's actual transformation into the Wolfman, Johnston further explained, \"I decided to basically shoot just Benicio, in the sequence where he transforms and decide in post-production what I wanted the transformation to be. That was really my main reason [for using CG]; it gave me so much more flexibility.\" [22] In February 2009, ZBrush art of the transformation by Baker leaked online.[23] In addition to the film, at the 2009 Halloween Horror Nights, Universal Studios Florida added The Wolfman to the event.[24] | The cast and crew were back on location re-shooting the film in the grounds of the Old Royal Naval College and park in Greenwich over the weekends of 22-25 and 30–31 May 2009. The purpose of the re-shoots was to change the way one werewolf looked in the film. Previously, it stood on two legs, but now, it stands on four. Also, an action scene was added between \"the Wolf Man and the Werewolf\" according to Vic Armstrong.[25]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Wolf Man  by Curt Siodmak","m_directed_by":"Joe Johnston","m_produced_by":"Scott Stuber Benicio del Toro Rick Yorn Sean Daniel","m_screenplay_by":"Andrew Kevin Walker David Self","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Benicio del Toro Anthony Hopkins Emily Blunt Hugo Weaving","m_music_by":"Danny Elfman","m_cinematography":"Shelly Johnson","m_edited_by":"Dennis Virkler Walter Murch Mark Goldblatt (Uncredited)","m_production_company":"Relativity Media Stuber Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"January 27, 2010 (2010-01-27) (premiere) | February 12, 2010 (2010-02-12) (wide) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"103 minutes (Theatrical) 119 minutes (Extended)","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$150 million[1]","m_box_office":"$139.8 million[1] | The Wolfman is a 2010 American horror film directed by Joe Johnston. It is a remake of the 1941 film of the same name, and tells the story of Lawrence Talbot who returns to his eerie English hometown of Blackmoor following the death of his brother by a werewolf which later attacks him. The film includes an ensemble cast featuring Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Hugo Weaving, and Geraldine Chaplin. The screenplay was written by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self with creature make-up effects by Rick Baker. | Acclaimed director Mark Romanek was originally attached to direct the film with the idea to \"...infuse a balance of cinema in a popcorn movie scenario.\"[2] However, creative disagreements between the studio forced him to depart from the project. Despite the project being left with no director, the planned filming schedule did not halt. Four weeks prior to filming, Universal hired Joe Johnston to direct the film. Although Johnston convinced the studio he could shoot the film in under 80 days, the film suffered a troubled production with rewrites, reshoots, reedits, the switch of music composers, all factors that forced the studio to push back the film's release date multiple times from its original November 2008.[3] | The film was released in the United States on February 12, 2010.[4] The film was met with a mixed to negative reception from critics and failed to make back its budget from the box office. Amongst the criticism pointed out by critics was the film's obvious troubled production reflected within the film's editing, directing, acting, and screenplay while some praised the film's dark melodic tone and atmosphere, its Victorian era set pieces, Danny Elfman's moody/eerie Eastern European-esque score and Baker's werewolf make-up effects which earned him an Academy Award for Best Makeup, along with make-up effects supervisor Dave Elsey. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c \"The Wolfman (2010)\".
