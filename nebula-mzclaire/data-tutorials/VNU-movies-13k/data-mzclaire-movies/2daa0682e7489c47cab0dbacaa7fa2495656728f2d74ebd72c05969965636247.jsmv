{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"James (Ryan O'Nan) returns from Iraq to face a new battle returning to his small-town life in Texas. His wife (America Ferrera), his mother (Melissa Leo), and his friend (Jason Ritter) provide support, but they can't fully understand the pain and suffering he feels since his tour of duty ended. Lonely, James reconnects with an army buddy, Raymond (Wilmer Valderrama), who provides him with compassion and friendship during his battle to process his experiences in Iraq. But their reunion also exposes the different ways that war affects people, at least on the surface. This moving story of redemption and reconstruction extends beyond a post-traumatic-stress-disorder narrative. O'Nan's performance is moving as he explores the depths of his internal struggle; Ferrera fearlessly tackles her role of a young wife in turmoil. The Dry Land is about one man's fight within his own terrain, his country, his home, and his mental health. He fights to rebuild what he lost.","m_cast":"America Ferrera as Sarah | Jason Ritter as Michael | Ethan Suplee as Jack | Wilmer Valderrama as Raymond Gonzales | Melissa Leo as Martha | June Diane Raphael as Susie | Evan Jones as Joe Davis | Ana Claudia Talancón as Adriana | Sasha Spielberg as Sally | Ryan O'Nan as James | Barry Shabaka Henley as Colonel Stephen Evans | Benito Martinez as David Valdez | Diego Klattenhoff as Henry | Misty Upham as Gloria | Jenny Gabrielle as Tina | Jeremiah Bitsui as Luis","m_reception":"The film received generally mixed to positive reviews.
