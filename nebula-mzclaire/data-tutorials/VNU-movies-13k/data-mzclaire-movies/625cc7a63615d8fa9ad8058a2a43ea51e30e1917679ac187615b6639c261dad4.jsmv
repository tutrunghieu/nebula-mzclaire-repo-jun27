The cement which binds their friendship is a deep love of cricket - but the ride is not always smooth. David finds himself falling for the indifferent Judy, but tensions between other families in the street, and a romantic relationship between Ruth Wiseman (Emily Woof) and Dennis, threaten to break apart the neighbourhood. It is one of the very few films related to the game of cricket. It was a failure at the box office. Some of the scenes were shot in Merchant Taylors School, Northwood.","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wondrousoblivion.htm","m_external_link":"Wondrous Oblivion at the Internet Movie Database | Wondrous Oblivion at AllMovie | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Wondrous_Oblivion.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Paul Morrison"}
