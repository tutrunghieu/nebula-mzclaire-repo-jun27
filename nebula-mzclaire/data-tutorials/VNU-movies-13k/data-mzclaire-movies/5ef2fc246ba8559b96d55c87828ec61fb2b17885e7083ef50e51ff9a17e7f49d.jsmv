{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Spider is the story of Dennis Cleg, a man who is given a room in a halfway house catering to mentally disturbed persons. Cleg has just been released from a mental institution and in his new abode starts piecing together or recreating in his memory an apparently fateful childhood event. He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and his father. A shift takes place in the child's psyche when he witnesses his mother groping with his father in the garden and, subsequently, when he sees his mother in a silky night gown she wore for his father. The son, as a grown man seems to recreate in his memory the buildup to his father's murder of his mother with the passive support of a prostitute he is involved with, who then moves into the house and is presented as his mother. The young son then kills the mistress by gassing her in the kitchen, although the final shot appears to show his true mother lying dead so we are left to wonder whether she really was his mother and the prostitute was just a fantasy. After that memory he sneaks late one night to the landlady's room and appears ready to kill her, whom he sees alternatively as the mistress, his mother and the landlady, but backs away after she says, \"What have you done Mr. Cleg?\" He is taken back to the asylum.","m_cast":"Ralph Fiennes as Dennis \"Spider\" Cleg Bradley Hall as young Spider | Miranda Richardson as Yvonne / Mrs. Cleg | Gabriel Byrne as Bill Cleg | John Neville as Terrence | Lynn Redgrave as Mrs. Wilkinson","m_reception":"Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 85% based on reviews from 130 critics.[3] On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 35 reviews.[4]Genie Awards for Best Director; TIFF – Best Canadian Feature; and TFCA – Best Canadian Film. | It was mentioned in the 2002 Sight & Sound Poll by Amy Taubin, who ranked it at 10th.[5]","m_production":"During a Q&A session at the Kodak Lecture Series in May 2005, Cronenberg revealed that neither he, nor Fiennes, nor Richardson, nor the producers received any sort of salary during the shooting of the film.
