Filmed by Levy-Gardner-Laven and released by United Artists, it stars Tom Tryon, Harve Presnell, Senta Berger, James Caan, and Michael Anderson, Jr. The film's screenplay was written by Sam Peckinpah long before the 1965 film was made. The director was Arnold Laven. Riz Ortolani composed the score and the title song. | Though a fictionalized Western based on George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the film is almost a generic war story covering the enlistment, training, and operational deployment of a group of recruits that could take place in any time period. | The large-scale film was made in Durango, Mexico, with large numbers of mounted extras and the final battle scene choreographed on 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land.[1] | The titles were drawn by Joseph Mugnaini for Format Productions. Cover versions of the title song were done by Al Caiola and sung by Frankie Laine. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Glory Guys at the Internet Movie Database | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/Glorguypos.jpg/220px-Glorguypos.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Sam Peckinpah"}
