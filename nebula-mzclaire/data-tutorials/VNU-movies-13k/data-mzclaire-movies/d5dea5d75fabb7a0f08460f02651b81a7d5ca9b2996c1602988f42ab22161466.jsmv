{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The owner of a liquor store in east New York in the Brooklyn-Queens border region finds a case of cheap wine (\"Tenafly Viper\") in his basement. It is more than 60 years old and has gone bad, but he decides to sell it to the local hobos anyway. Unfortunately, anyone who drinks the Viper melts away in a hideous fashion. At the same time, two homeless brothers find different ways to cope with homelessness while they make their residence in a local junkyard while one employee, a female cashier and clerk, frequently tends to both of them. Meanwhile, an overzealous cop (Bill Chepil) is trying to get to the bottom of all the deaths, all the while trying to end the tyranny of a deranged Vietnam veteran named Bronson (Vic Noto), who has made his self-proclaimed \"kingdom\" at the junkyard with a group of homeless vets under his command as his personal henchmen. | The film is littered with darkly comedic deaths and injuries. It also contains the notorious \"severed privates\" scene where a group of homeless people play catch with the severed genital of one of their number, as he futilely attempts to recover it.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Roy Frumkes wrote the screenplay.
