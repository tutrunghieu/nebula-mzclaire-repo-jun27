{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The plot of the animated production is in most respects similar to that of the book; but certain plot points are significantly compressed or removed due to the time limitations of the format. In addition, certain scenes are obviously edited for commercial breaks. In general, alterations are confined to simple omission of detail, and the plot adheres to the written text, including lyrics adapted from the songs in the book but in much longer and greater format.[2]","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Arthur Rankin, Jr. Jules Bass","m_sequel":"Before The Hobbit ever aired on NBC, Rankin/Bass and its partner animation houses were preparing a sequel.[2] Meanwhile, United Artists released J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings in 1978, an animated adaptation directed by Ralph Bakshi, originally intended as the first part in a two-part film. | Their own sequel having been cancelled after a disagreement with Bakshi, Rankin/Bass proceeded with their plans to produce their own television installment of The Lord of the Rings, bringing back most of the animation team and voice cast. Taking elements from the last volume of The Lord of the Rings which had not been used by Bakshi, they developed the musical The Return of the King. They were unable to provide continuity for the missing segments, developing instead a framing device in which both films begin and end with Bilbo's stay at Rivendell, connecting the later film directly to the better-received Hobbit.","m_based_on":"The Hobbit  by J.
