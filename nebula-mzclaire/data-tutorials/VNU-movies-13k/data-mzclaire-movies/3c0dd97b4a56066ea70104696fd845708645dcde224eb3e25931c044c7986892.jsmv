{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"As a child, Joan has a violent and supernatural vision. She returns home to find her village burning. Her sister Catherine tries to protect her by hiding her from the attacking English forces, part of a longstanding rivalry with France. Joan, while hiding, witnesses the brutal murder and rape of her sister. Afterward, Joan is taken in by distant relatives. | Several years later at Chinon, the Dauphin and soon to be King of France, Charles VII (John Malkovich), receives a message from the now adult Joan (Milla Jovovich), asking him to provide an army to lead into battle against the occupying English. After meeting him and his mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon (Faye Dunaway) she describes her visions. Desperate, he believes her prophecy. | Clad in armor, Joan leads the French army to the besieged city of Orléans. She gives the English a chance to surrender, which they refuse. The armies' commanders, skeptical of Joan's leadership, initiate the next morning's battle to take over the stockade at St. Loup without her. By the time she arrives on the battlefield, the French soldiers are retreating. Joan ends the retreat and leads another charge, successfully capturing the fort. They proceed to the enemy stronghold called the \"Tourelles\". Joan gives the English another chance to surrender, but they refuse. Joan leads the French soldiers to attack the Tourelles, though the English defenders inflict heavy casualties, also wounding Joan. Nevertheless, Joan leads a second attack the following day. As the English army regroups, the French army moves to face them across an open field. Joan rides alone toward the English and offers them a final chance to surrender and return to England. The English accept her offer and retreat. | Joan returns to Rheims to witness the coronation of Charles VII of France. Her military campaigns then continue to the walls of Paris, though she does not receive her requested reinforcements, and the siege is a failure. Joan tells King Charles VII to give her another army, but he refuses, saying he now prefers diplomacy over warfare. Believing she threatens his position, Charles conspires to get rid of Joan by allowing her to be captured by enemy forces. She is taken prisoner by the pro-English Burgundians at Compiègne, who sell her to the English. | Charged with the crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English occupation government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught that she will be executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan in confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God. | The frustrated English devise another way to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting that she is a witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen.","m_cast":"Milla Jovovich as Joan of Arc | John Malkovich as Charles VII of France | Faye Dunaway as Yolande of Aragon | Dustin Hoffman as The Conscience | Andrew Birkin as John Talbot | Vincent Cassel as Gilles de Rais | Pascal Greggory as John II, Duke of Alençon | Richard Ridings as La Hire | Desmond Harrington as Jean d'Aulon | Timothy West as Pierre Cauchon | Gina McKee as Duchess of Bedford | Tchéky Karyo as Jean de Dunois","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Luc Besson was originally hired as executive producer for a film that was to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Bigelow had been developing ideas for a Joan of Arc film for about a decade. Her film was to be entitled Company of Angels, with Jay Cocks hired to write the script. The film was to be made with Besson's assistance and financial backing. In July 1996 contracts between Bigelow and Besson were exchanged, which gave Besson the right to be consulted on casting in addition to his personal fee. According to Bigelow, eight weeks prior to filming, Besson realised that his then wife, Milla Jovovich, was not going to be cast as Joan, and he subsequently withdrew his support from the film, and with it the support of his financial backers. Bigelow threatened legal action for breach of contract and \"stealing her research\";[11] the matter was settled out of court.[5] After Besson left, he commenced production of his own Joan of Arc project, The Messenger, with Jovovich given the lead role; the production of Company of Angels disbanded shortly thereafter.[12] The Messenger was intended to follow up the success Besson and Jovovich achieved with their previous collaboration, The Fifth Element.[5] | Filming took place in the Czech Republic. A stuntman died in an accident during the first weeks of filming.[5] Besson was said to have become completely uncommunicative after the incident, only appearing on set to shout orders at people.[13]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Luc Besson","m_produced_by":"Patrice Ledoux","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Milla Jovovich | John Malkovich | Faye Dunaway | Dustin Hoffman | Gina McKee | Tchéky Karyo","m_music_by":"Éric Serra","m_cinematography":"Thierry Arbogast","m_edited_by":"Sylvie Landra","m_production_company":"Gaumont","m_distributed_by":"Gaumont","m_release_dates":"18 October 1999 (1999-10-18) (premiere) | 27 October 1999[1] (1999[1]-10-27) (France) | 12 November 1999[1] (1999[1]-11-12) (United States) |  | ","m_running_time":"158 minutes[2]","m_country":"France","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$60 million[3][4]","m_box_office":"$67 million[2] | The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc) is a 1999 French historical drama film directed by Luc Besson. The film stars Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman. The screenplay was written by Besson and Andrew Birkin, and the original music score was composed by Éric Serra. | The Messenger portrays the story of St. Joan of Arc, the French war heroine and religious martyr of the 15th century. The story begins with young Joan as she witnesses the atrocities of the English against her family, and she is portrayed as having visions that inspire her to lead the French in battle against the occupying English forces. Her success in routing the English allows Charles VII to take the throne. Eventually Joan is tried and executed for heresy. | Besson's previous film, The Fifth Element, which also starred Jovovich, was a critical and financial success, and it had a positive influence on both their careers. The Messenger was intended to follow up that success and cement the status of Besson and Jovovich in film.[5] However, the film received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office,[6] earning just under $67 million on an $60 million budget. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"Notes | ^ a b c McCarthy, Todd (31 October 1999). \"Review: 'The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc – Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan'\".
