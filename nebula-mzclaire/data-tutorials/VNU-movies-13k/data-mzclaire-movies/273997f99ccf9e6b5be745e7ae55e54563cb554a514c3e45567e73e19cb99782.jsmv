{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Nick Wild (Jason Statham) is a recovering gambling addict who takes odd jobs in Las Vegas as a \"chaperone\" (his version of a bodyguard) to support his addiction. After helping a client impress a woman (Sofia Vergara), he accepts a proposition from meek self-made millionaire Cyrus Kinnick (Michael Angarano) to show him around Vegas and provide him with protection while he gambles. | While eating at a diner, Nick's waitress friend Roxy (Anne Heche) hands him a message from a woman he knows, Holly (Dominik Garcia-Lorido), who wants him to stop by her house. Holly, a professional escort, explains she had a date the previous night at the Golden Nugget. Afterward, she was brutally raped and beaten by three unknown men in their hotel room. Holly asks Nick to find out who they are so that she can sue them, though unbeknownst to Nick, she plans to take revenge. | Nick discovers that the man responsible for raping Holly is Danny DeMarco (Milo Ventimiglia), a gangster. DeMarco had his two thugs dump her in a hospital car park. Nick goes to the hotel to confront DeMarco, disguised as someone sent by another criminal. A confrontation develops but Nick defends himself, overpowering DeMarco and his men, who are tied up as Nick calls Holly. In the room, Holly contemplates castrating DeMarco, who breaks down and begs her forgiveness, Holly decides to take $50,000 from DeMarco’s desk and leave. | Holly splits the money with Nick and leaves Las Vegas. Nick decides to take Cyrus to a casino and gamble with his half of DeMarco’s money. Playing blackjack with dealer friend Cassandra (Hope Davis), he has a winning streak, amassing a total of $506,000 in casino chips. When cashing out, Nick has a sudden anxiety attack and tells Cyrus that even though the $500,000 will last him for many years, it isn’t enough to last him for a lifetime. Back at the casino tables, Nick loses all of his money in a single bet. When leaving the hotel, Nick is attacked by DeMarco’s men, and has to fight his way out of the casino. | The next day, Nick goes to a meeting with Baby (Stanley Tucci), the mafia boss of Las Vegas. Baby has received a complaint from DeMarco, who claims that Nick broke into his hotel room, pistol-whipped him, and killed two of his men – all to fund his gambling addiction. Baby warns Nick that if he cannot prove his innocence, he will have to be killed. Nick tells Baby that DeMarco is lying, explaining that DeMarco obviously had killed two of his own men because they had witnessed him pleading for his life. To prove he is telling the truth, Nick tells Baby that when Holly considered castrating DeMarco, she had cut the side of his penis with garden shears. Baby asks DeMarco to pull down his pants and prove Nick wrong, but after he refuses, Baby concludes that DeMarco is lying and lets Nick go free. | Nick goes back to his local diner. He is approached by Cyrus, who offers Nick $500,000 and a plane ticket to Corsica, but only if he helps him \"become a man\" and learn how to defend himself. DeMarco and his men appear in the diner. Cyrus starts singing, creating a distraction for Nick. After realizing that DeMarco won’t stop until he is dead, Nick finally kills DeMarco and all of his men with two eating utensils. Cyrus gives him a cheque for $500,000 and the plane ticket, telling him that he has earned it. After saying goodbye to each other, Nick leaves Las Vegas for good.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Simon West said that Jason Statham developed the project himself \"maybe over five years\".[6] At one point, Brian De Palma was slated to direct until West replaced him.[7] West stated: | West said the script filmed was the one Goldman wrote over thirty years ago. He later elaborated: | I rang him up and said, \"I'm about to put the record straight and fix this film for you.\" I did ask him, what's your one piece of advice for me when shooting this? He said, \"Just make sure that Nick is the toughest guy you've ever seen in your life.\" That, I think is his approach - no matter how complicated the character is intellectually, no matter how much dialogue there is, or twists and turns Goldman puts in the script, at the end of the day, he has this one thing that he has above his desk that reminds him what the character should be. It was the same for me - once he told me that, \"Nick's the toughest guy in Vegas\", every scene informs that. Even when he's not doing anything, everybody in the room knows that, and everybody knows his history, what he's capable of. And so he ultimately doesn't have to do that much, because he is the toughest guy in Vegas.[8] | \"“It was nice firstly to have a script that was so set, because on any big movie scripts are constantly in flux,\" said West. \"It also made it easy to sell to actors like Stanley Tucci and Sofia Vergara because their parts were very set out. There’s nothing in the script that’s really aged, there’s no pyrotechnics or technology really.”[9] | Filming began in early 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana.[10] The principal photography began in February 2013.[11] | Simon West said the three fights were \"character driven\". | each one of the action moments is character-driven, so you're right, it builds up. So when it does explode, it's exploding for the right reason. The first one, he's getting back into his old skills - precision fighting. The only way he's going to get out alive is by relying on his old skills. And he's a master of that. The second fight explodes out of anger, and it's really anger at himself for going back to being a gambling addict. They're character-driven fights. Whereas traditionally in action films, they're light relief - they're almost commercial breaks in the story. These ones come out of the situation his character's in, not just that he's in jeopardy and has to fight his way out of it - they're emotional fights.
