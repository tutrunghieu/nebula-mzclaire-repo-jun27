The entire enterprise is as convincing as the Spanish landscapes, which are meant to suggest the American Southwest but don't.\"[4] | Keith Bailey of The Unknown Movies said, \"Although the movie was filmed in Spain, you wouldn't know it, since Fleischer shot the outdoor scenes in remarkably drab locations that all look the same. And there is a breakdown in the natural flow of the story in the last twenty minutes, becoming more like a series of vignettes with little tying them together. It's therefore surprising the few times Fleischer breaks out of his mediocrity and puts in some effort.\" [5]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Bank Robber","m_directed_by":"Richard Fleischer","m_produced_by":"Richard Fleischer Walter Mirisch","m_screenplay_by":"Irving Ravetch Harriet Frank, Jr.","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Lee Marvin Gary Grimes Charles Martin Smith Ron Howard Arthur Hunnicutt Noah Beery, Jr.","m_music_by":"Fred Karlin","m_cinematography":"Brian West","m_edited_by":"Frank J.
