{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"John Wisdom is a young man just out of college. He's branded a felon after a grand theft auto conviction on the night of his high school graduation, and as a result can't hold down a decent job. Seeing little future for himself, Wisdom takes a left turn: he becomes a criminal \"for the people,\" evocative of Robin Hood. After seeing news reports about all the impoverished farmers and working class being sent to the bank to pay ownership debts, Wisdom goes on a bank robbing spree with his girlfriend, Karen Simmons; they erase loan and mortgage records, buying time for the poor to pay their debts. | With the FBI after them, things take a turn for the worse when a panicky Karen murders a local sheriff. She and Wisdom make a run for the Canadian border, but when Karen is shot by a police helicopter, Wisdom leaves her in the care of some high school students and their teacher. He resumes his flight, but is surrounded by police and federal agents at a college football field. As Wisdom appears to be reaching for his gun, he is riddled with gunfire and dies. | John wakes up where the film started, in his parents' bathroom. He emerges from the shower and proceeds to get ready for his job interview. His entire story has apparently been a daydream.","m_cast":"Emilio Estevez as John Wisdom | Demi Moore as Karen Simmons | Tom Skerritt as Lloyd Wisdom | Veronica Cartwright as Samantha Wisdom | William Allen Young as Agent Williamson | Richard Minchenberg as Agent Cooper | Ernie Brown as Bill, Motel manager | Charlie Sheen as City Burger manager | Brenda Medcalf as Girl on bike","m_reception":"The film received negative reviews from critics: Leonard Maltin considered it \"wretchedly scripted, with one of the most self-defeating wrap-ups you'll ever see.\"","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Emilio Estevez","m_produced_by":"Bernard Williams","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Emilio Estevez | Demi Moore | Tom Skerritt | Veronica Cartwright","m_music_by":"Danny Elfman","m_cinematography":"Adam Greenberg","m_edited_by":"Michael Kahn","m_production_company":"Gladden Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox (USA) Cannon Films (International)","m_release_dates":"December 31, 1986 (1986-12-31) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"109 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$5,715,174[2] | Wisdom is a 1986 American romantic crime film written and directed by its star Emilio Estevez in his filmmaking debut.
