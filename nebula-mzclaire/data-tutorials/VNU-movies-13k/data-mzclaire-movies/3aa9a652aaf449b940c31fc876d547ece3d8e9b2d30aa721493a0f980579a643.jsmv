{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"\"The Che of The Motorcycle Diaries is more akin to Jack Kerouac or Neal Cassady than Marx or Lenin.\" | In 1952, a semester before Ernesto \"Fuser\" Guevara is due to complete his medical degree, he and his older friend Alberto Granado, a biochemist, leave Buenos Aires in order to travel across South America. While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700 mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\"The Mighty One\"). | Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July. | During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \"haves\" (to which they belong) and the \"have-nots\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the Chuquicamata copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers. | However, it is a visit to the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventual polluted urban decay of nearby Lima.[6] His reflections are interrupted by Granado, who shares with him a dream to peacefully revolutionize and transform modern South America, to which Guevara quickly retorts: \"A revolution without guns? It will never work.\" | Later, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the San Pablo leper colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living to the south. To demonstrate his solidarity, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit, choosing instead to shake bare hands with the surprised leper patients. | \"Every generation needs a journey story; every generation needs a story about what it is to be transformed by geography, what it is to be transformed by encounters with cultures and people that are alien from yourself, and you know that age group 15 to 25, that’s the perfect generation to get on a motorcycle, to hit the road, to put on your backpack and just go out.\" | At the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent egalitarian, anti-authority impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it he evokes a pan-Latin American identity that transcends both the arbitrary boundaries of nation and race. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary. | Lastly, Guevara makes his symbolic \"final journey\" at night when, despite his asthma, he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors cabins. As they bid each other farewell, Granado reveals that his birthday was not in fact 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along. The film is closed with an appearance by the real 82-year-old Alberto Granado, along with pictures from the actual journey and a brief mention of Che Guevara's eventual 1967 CIA-assisted execution in the Bolivian jungle.","m_cast":"Gael García Bernal as Che Guevara [8] | Rodrigo de la Serna as Alberto Granado | Mercedes Morán as Celia de la Serna | Jean Pierre Noher as Ernesto Guevara Lynch | Facundo Espinosa as Tomás Granado | Mía Maestro as Chichina | Lucas Oro as Roberto Guevara | Marina Glezer as Celita Guevara | Sofia Bertolotto as Ana María Guevara | Franco Solazzi as Juan Martín Guevara | Ricardo Díaz Mourelle as Uncle Jorge | Sergio Boris as Young Traveler | Daniel Cargieman as Young Traveler | Diego Giorzi as Rodolfo | Gustavo Bueno as Doctor Hugo Pesce | Alberto Granado as himself (cameo at the end of the film) | Matías Strafe as Chichina's friend","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Motorcycle Diaries  by Che Guevara","m_directed_by":"Walter Salles","m_produced_by":"Edgard Tenenbaum Michael Nozik Karen Tenkhoff","m_screenplay_by":"José Rivera","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Gael García Bernal Rodrigo de la Serna Mercedes Morán Jean Pierre Noher Facundo Espinosa Mía Maestro","m_music_by":"Gustavo Santaolalla","m_cinematography":"Eric Gautier","m_edited_by":"Daniel Rezende","m_production_company":"FilmFour BD Cine","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista International (ARG) Pathé (UK) Focus Features (USA)","m_release_dates":"15 January 2004 (2004-01-15) (Sundance) | 19 May 2004 (2004-05-19) (Cannes) | 24 September 2004 (2004-09-24) (USA) |  | ","m_running_time":"126 minutes[1]","m_country":"Argentina United States Chile Peru Brazil United Kingdom Germany France","m_language":"Spanish Quechua","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$57.7 million[2] | The Motorcycle Diaries (Spanish: Diarios de motocicleta) is a 2004 biopic about the journey and written memoir of the 23-year-old Ernesto Guevara, who would several years later become internationally known as the iconic Marxist guerrilla commander and revolutionary Che Guevara. The film recounts the 1952 expedition, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado. As the adventure, initially centered on youthful hedonism, unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations on the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. Through the characters they encounter on their continental trek, Guevara and Granado witness firsthand the injustices that the destitute face and are exposed to people and social classes they would have never encountered otherwise. To their surprise, the road presents to them both a genuine and captivating picture of Latin American identity. As a result, the trip also plants the initial seed of cognitive dissonance and radicalization within Guevara, who ostensibly would later view armed revolution as a way to challenge the continent's endemic economic inequalities. | The screenplay is based primarily on Guevara's travelogue of the same name, with additional context supplied by Traveling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary by Alberto Granado. Guevara is played by Mexican actor Gael García Bernal (who previously played Che in the 2002 miniseries Fidel), and Granado by the Argentine actor Rodrigo de la Serna, who coincidentally is a second cousin to the real life Guevara on his maternal side.[3] Directed by Brazilian director Walter Salles and written by Puerto Rican playwright José Rivera, the film was an international co-production among production companies from Argentina, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Chile, Peru and France. The film's executive producers were Robert Redford, Paul Webster, and Rebecca Yeldham; the producers were Edgard Tenenbaum, Michael Nozik, and Karen Tenkhoff; and the co-producers were Daniel Burman and Diego Dubcovsky. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"DIARIOS DE MOTOCICLETA - THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES (15)\".
