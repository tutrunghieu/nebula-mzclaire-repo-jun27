{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1982, Ari Folman was a nineteen-year-old infantry soldier in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In 2006, he meets with a friend from his army service period, who tells him of the nightmares connected to his experiences from the Lebanon War. Folman is surprised to find that he remembers nothing from that period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, the reality of which he is unable to clearly recall. In his memory, he and his soldier comrades are bathing at night by the seaside in Beirut under the light of flares descending over the city. | Folman rushes off to meet a childhood friend, who advises him to seek out other people who were in Beirut at the same time in order to understand what happened there and to revive his own memories. Folman converses with friends and other soldiers who served in the war, a psychologist, and the Israeli TV reporter Ron Ben-Yishai who covered Beirut at the time, amongst others. Folman eventually realizes that he \"was in the second or third ring\" of soldiers surrounding the Palestinian refugee camp where the carnage was perpetrated, and that he was among those soldiers firing flares into the sky to illuminate the refugee camp for the Lebanese Christian Phalange militia perpetrating the massacre inside. He concludes that his amnesia had stemmed from his feeling as a teenage soldier that he was as guilty of the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with animation dissolving into actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre.","m_cast":"The film contains both fictional composites of real-life figures and actual living people. | Ari Folman, an Israeli film-maker who recently finished his military reserve service.

It is unusual in it being a feature-length documentary made almost entirely by the means of animation. It combines classical music, 1980s music, realistic graphics, and surrealistic scenes together with illustrations similar to comics. The entire film is animated, excluding one short segment of news archive footage. | The animation, with its dark hues representing the overall feel of the film, uses a unique style invented by Yoni Goodman at the Bridgit Folman Film Gang studio in Israel. The technique is often confused with rotoscoping, an animation style that uses drawings over live footage, but is actually a combination of Adobe Flash cutouts and classic animation.[6] Each drawing was sliced into hundreds of pieces which were moved in relation to one another, thus creating the illusion of movement. The film was first shot in a sound studio as a 90-minute video and then transferred to a storyboard. From there 2,300 original illustrations were drawn based on the storyboard, which together formed the actual film scenes using Flash animation, classic animation, and 3D technologies.[7] | The original soundtrack was composed by minimalist electronic musician Max Richter while the featured songs are by OMD (\"Enola Gay\"), PiL (\"This is Not a Love Song\"), Navadey Haukaf (נוודי האוכף )(\"Good Morning Lebanon\", written for the film), The Clique (\"Incubator\"), and Zeev Tene (a remake of the Cake song \"I Bombed Korea\", retitled \"Beirut\"). Some reviewers have viewed the music as playing an active role as commentator on events instead of simple accompaniment.[8] | The comics medium, in particular Joe Sacco,[9] the novels Catch-22, The Adventures of Wesley Jackson, and Slaughterhouse-Five,[10] and painter Otto Dix[11] were mentioned by Folman and art director David Polonsky as influences on the film. The film itself was adapted into a graphic novel in 2009.[12]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Ari Folman","m_produced_by":"Ari Folman | Serge Lalou | Gerhard Meixner | Yael Nahlieli | Roman Paul","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ari Folman","m_music_by":"Max Richter","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Nili Feller","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Sony Pictures Classics","m_release_dates":"13 May 2008 (2008-05-13) (Cannes) | 5 June 2008 (2008-06-05) (Israel) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"90 minutes[1]","m_country":"Israel | Germany | France","m_language":"Hebrew","m_budget":"$2 million[2]","m_box_office":"$11,125,849[3] | Waltz with Bashir (Hebrew: ואלס עם באשיר‎‎, translit. Vals Im Bashir) is a 2008 Israeli animated war documentary film written and directed by Ari Folman.
