{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Battle of Algiers was inspired by Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger, by Saadi Yacef, the campaign account of an FLN military commander.[7] The book, written by Yacef while a prisoner of the French, was FLN morale-boosting propaganda for militants. After independence, Yacef was released and became part of the new government. The Algerian government backed a film of Yacef's memoir; exiled FLN man Salash Baazi approached the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas with the project. | Yacef wrote his own screenplay, which does not have any conversations or plot,[8] which the Italian producers rejected as too biased towards the Algerians. Although sympathetic to Algerian nationalism, the Italian businessmen insisted on dealing with events from a neutral perspective. The final screenplay of The Battle of Algiers has an Algerian protagonist and depicts the cruelty and suffering of French and Algerians.[9] | Despite its basis in true events, The Battle of Algiers uses composite characters and changes the names of certain persons. For example, Colonel Mathieu is a composite of several French counterinsurgency officers, especially Jacques Massu.[10] Saadi Yacef has stated that Mathieu was actually more based on Marcel Bigeard, although the character is also reminiscent of Roger Trinquier.[11] Accused of portraying him as too elegant and noble, screenwriter Solinas denied that this was his intention; the Colonel is \"elegant and cultured, because Western civilization is neither inelegant nor uncultured\".[12] | For The Battle of Algiers, Pontecorvo and cinematographer Marcello Gatti filmed in black and white and experimented with various techniques to give the film the look of newsreel and documentary film. The effect was convincing enough that American releases carried a disclaimer that \"not one foot\" of newsreel was used.[13] | Pontecorvo's use of fictional realism enables the movie \"to operate along a double-bind as it consciously addresses different audiences.\" The film makes special use of television in order to link western audiences with images they are constantly faced with and always depicting the \"truth\". The film seems to be filmed through the point of view of a western reporter, as telephoto lenses and hand-held cameras are used, whilst \"depicting the struggle from a 'safe' distance with French soldiers placed between the crowds and camera.\"[14] | Pontecorvo chose to cast non-professional Algerians he met, picking them mainly on appearance and emotional effect (as a result, many of their lines were dubbed).[15] The sole professional actor of the movie was Jean Martin, who played Coloniel Mathieu; Martin was a French actor who had worked primarily in theatre. Pontecorvo wanted a professional actor, but one with whom audiences would not be too familiar, which could have interfered with the movie's intended realism. Martin had been dismissed several years earlier from the Théâtre National Populaire for signing the manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War. Martin had also served in a paratroop regiment during the Indochina War as well as the French Resistance, thus giving his character an autobiographical element. The working relationship between Martin and Pontecorvo was not always easy, as the director, unsure that Martin's professional acting style would not contrast too much with that of the non-professionals, kept arguing with his acting choices.[16] | Sound—both music and effects—performs important functions in the movie. Indigenous Algerian drumming, rather than dialogue, is heard during a scene in which female FLN militants prepare for a bombing. In addition, Pontecorvo used the sounds of gunfire, helicopters and truck engines to symbolize the French methods of battle, while bomb blasts, ululation, wailing and chanting symbolize the Algerian methods. Gillo Pontecorvo had written the music for The Battle of Algiers, but because he was classed as a \"melodist-composer\" in Italy, it required him to work with another composer which was undertaken by his good friend Ennio Morricone.[17]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Gillo Pontecorvo","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jean Martin Saadi Yacef Brahim Haggiag Tommaso Neri","m_music_by":"Ennio Morricone Gillo Pontecorvo","m_cinematography":"Marcello Gatti","m_edited_by":"Mario Morra Mario Serandrei","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Rizzoli, Rialto Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 8, 1966 (1966-09-08) (Algeria) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"120 minutes","m_country":"Italy Algeria","m_language":"Arabic French","m_budget":"$800,000 | The Battle of Algiers (Italian: La battaglia di Algeri; Arabic: معركة الجزائر‎‎; French: La Bataille d'Alger) is a 1966 Italian-Algerian historical war film co-written and directed by Gillo Pontecorvo and starring Jean Martin and Saadi Yacef. It is based on events during the Algerian War (1954–62) against the French government in North Africa; the most prominent being the titular Battle of Algiers, the capital of Algeria. It was shot on location and the film score was composed by Ennio Morricone. The film, which was shot in a Rossellini-inspired newsreel style—in black and white with documentary-type editing—is often associated with Italian neorealism cinema.[1] | The film has been critically celebrated and often taken, by insurgent groups and states alike, as an important commentary on urban guerrilla warfare. It occupies the 48th place on the Critics' Top 250 Films of the 2012 Sight & Sound poll[2] as well as 120th place on Empire magazine's list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[3] | Algeria gained independence from the French, a matter which Pontecorvo portrays in the film's epilogue. The film concentrates on the years between 1954 and 1957 when the guerrilla fighters regrouped and expanded into the Casbah, the citadel of Algiers, which was met by French paratroopers attempting to regain territory. The highly dramatic film is about the organization of a guerrilla movement and the illegal methods used by the colonial power to contain it. | A subject of socio-political controversy, the film wasn't screened for five years in France, where it was later released in 1971.[4] |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Slow Looking: The Ethics and Politics of Aesthetics: Jill Bennett, Empathic Vision: Affect, Trauma, and Contemporary Art (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2005) Mark Reinhardt, Holly Edwards, and Erina Duganne, Beautiful Suffering: Photography and the Traffic in Pain (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2007) Gillo Pontecorvo, director, The Battle of Algiers (Criterion: Special Three-Disc Edition, 2004)\". sagepub.com.
