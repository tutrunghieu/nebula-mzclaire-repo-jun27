{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On a sunny day in an affluent suburb in Connecticut, a fit and tanned middle-aged man in a bathing suit, Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster), drops by a pool party being held by old friends, the Westerhazys. They offer him a cocktail while nursing hangovers from the night before. As they share stories, Ned realizes that there is a series of swimming pools that form a \"river\" to his house, making it possible for him to \"swim\" his way home. Ned dives into the pool, emerging at the other end and beginning his journey. Ned's behavior perplexes his friends, who know things about his recent past he seems to have forgotten. | As Ned travels he encounters other neighbors. He meets 20-year-old Julie (Janet Landgard), who used to babysit his daughter, and reveals his idea to her; she joins him. Together, they have several experiences, including crashing another pool party and sipping champagne. While chatting in the forest, Julie reveals that she had a schoolgirl crush on Ned, who begins talking about how he will protect her, making plans for the two of them. Discomfited, Julie runs away. | The neighborhood is full of judgmental, well-heeled people intent on one-upsmanship, and Ned continues to be confronted by reminders that his past was not always as he remembers it. | Ned meets a wealthy older couple, unbothered by his eccentric behavior but also unimpressed by his posturing, and a lonely young boy with whom Ned spends a short time. He fails to make any real connection with the people he meets, being obsessed with his journey, and becoming increasingly out of touch with reality. | Ned carries on with his plan. He walks into another party where the hostess, who seems to have had a past encounter with him, playfully calls him a \"party crasher\". He encounters there a bubbly girl, Joan (Joan Rivers), who does not know him. Ned asks her to join him, and Joan is intrigued until she is warned off by a friend. Ned jumps into the pool, grabbing the attention of the guests. When he gets out of the water, he notices a cart that used to be his, being used to serve hot dogs. Ned gets into a spat with the homeowner, who claims to have bought it at a white elephant sale. | Ned then shows up at the backyard pool of Shirley Abbott (Janice Rule), a stage actress with whom he had an affair several years earlier. His warm memories of their time together are not in agreement with her own experience of having been \"the other woman\". Unable to reconcile his feelings with the pain he has caused, Ned wades into the deep end of the pool. | Ned continues on, winding up at a crowded public swimming pool. He is confronted by local shopkeepers who ask him \"How do you like our water?\" and ask him when he will settle his unpaid bills. When some of them let loose vicious comments about his wife's snobbish tastes and his out-of-control daughter's recent troubles with the law, it is too much for Ned and he flees. | Near sunset, a shivering, limping Ned staggers home, as rain pours down, and finds his house locked and deserted. Peering in through a window, he sees that it has been emptied of furniture, and appears to have been abandoned for some time.","m_cast":"Cast notes | David Garfield was the son of actor John Garfield, and is billed as \"John Garfield Jr.\"[2] | Janice Rule replaced Barbara Loden in the part of Shirley Abbott | The Swimmer was comedian Joan Rivers' film debut as an actress – she had appeared as herself three years earlier in Hootenanny a Go Go, also released as Once Upon a Coffeehouse.[3] In The Swimmer, her short scene took more time than necessary to shoot, which she blamed on Lancaster, writing in her autobiography that, \"He redirected every line ... Frank (Perry) wanted a happy girl who then got hurt. Lancaster was going to be Mr. Wonderful who came up against a mean bitch, and was right not to go off with her. Trying to please both men, I was going back and forth between line readings, and nothing made sense.\"[2] | After working on several television series, the film was Janet Landgard's first featured cinematic role. It also features short appearances by Kim Hunter, Cornelia Otis Skinner, and Diana Muldaur, among others.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Swimmer was produced by Sam Spiegel, a three-time Academy Award for Best Picture winner, who ultimately removed his name from the film (although the logo of his company, Horizon Pictures, remains). It was filmed largely on location in Westport, Connecticut, hometown of director Frank Perry.[4] Principal production took place during the summer of 1966, but the film was not released until 1968. | Although he was a trained athlete, star Burt Lancaster had a fear of the water, and took swimming lessons from former Olympian and UCLA water polo coach Bob Horn to prepare for the film. | According to Rivers, Lancaster and Frank Perry had confrontations on the set. Perry was ultimately fired by Spiegel sometime after the first cut of the film was screened. The producers then brought in Lancaster's friend, the young director Sydney Pollack. Pollack reportedly reshot several transitions and scenes, including the Shirley Abbott scene with Janice Rule now playing the part originally played by Barbara Loden. According to Lancaster, when the film needed an additional day of shooting, he paid $10,000 for it out of his own pocket.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Swimmer (short story) in The New Yorker (1964)  by John Cheever","m_directed_by":"Frank Perry Sydney Pollack (uncredited scenes)","m_produced_by":"Frank Perry Roger Lewis Sam Spiegel (uncredited)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Burt Lancaster","m_music_by":"Marvin Hamlisch","m_cinematography":"David L.
