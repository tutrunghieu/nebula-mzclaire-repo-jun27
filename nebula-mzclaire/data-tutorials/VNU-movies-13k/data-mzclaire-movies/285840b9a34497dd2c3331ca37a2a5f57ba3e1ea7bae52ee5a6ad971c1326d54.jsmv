{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1992, ITN reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) travels to Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He meets American star journalist Jimmy Flynn (Woody Harrelson) on the chase for the most exciting stories and pictures. Henderson and Flynn have friendly arguments and differences in the intervals between reporting. They stay at the Holiday Inn, which was the primary hotel for the press in Sarajevo during the siege. After a previous translator proves corrupt and inept, ITN hires Risto (Goran Višnjić) to be Henderson's translator. Their work permits them blunt and unobstructed views of the suffering of the people of Sarajevo. The situation changes when Henderson makes a report from an orphanage located on the front lines (Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage) in which two hundred children live in desperate conditions. After increasingly brutal attacks fail to make the lead story in the UK, Henderson makes the orphanage his lead story to try to bring full attention to the war. | When American aid worker Nina (Marisa Tomei) organises a UN-sanctioned bus-borne evacuation of several orphaned Sarajevan children to Italy, Henderson convinces Nina to include a Bosniak girl from the orphanage, Emira (Emira Nušević), to whom Henderson had made a promise to evacuate. Nina knows this is an illegal act – Emira's mother is still alive and signed no papers authorising the evacuation – but the orphanage director allows it because of the desperate circumstances. Henderson and his cameraman accompany the evacuation under the pretense of covering it as a news story. | Despite a UN escort, Bosnian Serbs hinder the evacuation at several points along its route. The final harassment is the worst – a group of Chetniks halt the bus, forcibly disembark the Bosnian Serb children and put them on their armed lorry, presumably to repatriate them. | When Henderson finally makes it to London with Emira, Emira quickly becomes a member of Henderson's family in a comfortable London home. After an ambiguous interval of perhaps 100 days, Henderson receives word from his former producer, who is still in Sarajevo, that Emira's mother wants Emira back. Henderson returns to Sarajevo, now riven not only by the siege but also by internal organised crime, and seeks out Risto, who has become a Bosnian-Herzegovinian soldier. Henderson recruits Risto to find Emira's mother. They nearly succeed, but the unstable situation unravels around them and they are forced to retreat. When Risto is killed by a sniper in his own home, Henderson falls back on Zeljko (Drazen Sivak), a concierge at the Holiday Inn who Henderson had helped in previous Sarajevo tours. Zeljko negotiates the streets and road-blocks that lead to Emira's mother. As prelude to signing the adoption papers, she outlines the reasons she wants Emira back. She cannot in good conscience bring Emira back to Sarajevo, though, and she signs the papers. | A running joke in the movie is the designation by a UN official that Sarajevo was only the 14th worst crisis in the world. In the middle of the movie, Harun, a cellist friend of Risto, says that he would play a concert on the streets of Sarajevo once it is designated the worst place on Earth. Though he acknowledges the danger, he claims that \"the people will die happily listening to my music.\" The movie ends with Harun holding a \"concert of peace\" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. Among the attendees are Henderson, Flynn and several children from the orphanage. Henderson gives Harun a sad smile; the concert is beautiful, but it also means that Sarajevo had, indeed, become the worst place on Earth. | The closing credits say that Emira still lives in England.","m_cast":"Stephen Dillane – Michael Henderson | Woody Harrelson – Jimmy Flynn | Marisa Tomei – Nina | Emira Nušević – Emira | Kerry Fox – Jane Carson | Goran Višnjić – Risto Bavić | James Nesbitt – Gregg | Emily Lloyd – Annie McGee | Igor Džambazov – Jacket | Gordana Gadžić – Mrs. Savić | Juliet Aubrey – Helen Henderson | Drazen Šivak – Željko | Vesna Orel – Munira Hodžić | Davor Janjić – Dragan | Vladimir Jokanović – Emira's Uncle | Senad Bašić – Svercer | Ines Fančović – Woman shouting at bread queue","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Winterbottom","m_produced_by":"Damian Jones Channel Four Films Miramax","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Stephen Dillane Woody Harrelson Marisa Tomei Goran Višnjić Emily Lloyd Kerry Fox Kerry Shale","m_music_by":"Adrian Johnston","m_cinematography":"Daf Hobson","m_edited_by":"Trevor Waite","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Miramax","m_release_dates":"6 November 1997 (1997-11-06) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"103 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian","m_budget":"US$9,000,000 | Welcome to Sarajevo is a British war film released in 1997.
