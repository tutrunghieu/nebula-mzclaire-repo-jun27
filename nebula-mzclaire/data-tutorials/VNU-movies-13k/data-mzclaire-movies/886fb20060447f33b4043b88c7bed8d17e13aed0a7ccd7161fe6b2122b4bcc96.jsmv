(Persian: خانه دوست کجاست‎‎, Khane-ye doust kodjast) is a 1987 Iranian film directed and written by Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami.[1] The title of the film was derived from a poem by Sohrab Sepehri. It is considered the first film in Kiarostami's Koker trilogy, followed by Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, all of which take place in Koker, Iran.[2] | The film tells a deceptively simple account of a conscientious schoolboy's quest to return his friend's notebook in a neighboring village, since, should his friend fail to hand it in the next day, it is likely he will get expelled. Hence this film has been seen as a metaphor for the sense of civil duty, about loyalty and everyday heroics. The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are also shown in many parts of the movie. | The film is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Mike Lorefice (2006). \"Where Is the Friend's Home, Iran - 1987\". metalasylum.com.
