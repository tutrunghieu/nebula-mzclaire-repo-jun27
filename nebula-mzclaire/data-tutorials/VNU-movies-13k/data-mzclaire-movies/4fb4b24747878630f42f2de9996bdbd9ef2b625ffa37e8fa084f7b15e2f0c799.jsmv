{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Lovers Lula and Sailor are separated after he is jailed for killing a man who attacked him with a knife; the assailant, Bobby Ray Lemon, was hired by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune. Upon Sailor's release, Lula picks him up at the prison where she hands him his snakeskin jacket. They go to a hotel where she reserved a room, make love and go to see the speed metal band Powermad. At the club, Sailor gets into a fight with a man who flirts with Lula, and then leads the band in a rendition of Elvis Presley's \"Love Me\". Later, back in the room, after making love again, Sailor and Lula finally decide to run away to California, breaking Sailor's parole. Marietta arranges for private detective Johnnie Farragut – her on-off boyfriend – to find them and bring them back. Unbeknownst to Farragut, however, Marietta also hires gangster Marcello Santos to track them and kill Sailor. Santos's minions capture and kill Farragut, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled psychosis. | Unaware of all of the events happening back in North Carolina, Lula and Sailor continue on their way until – according to Lula – they witness a bad omen: the aftermath of a two-car accident, and the only survivor, a young woman, dies in front of them. With little money left, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he contacts \"old friend\" Perdita Durango, who might be able to help them, although she secretly knows he is under contract to be killed by Lula's mother. While Sailor agrees to join up with gangster Bobby Peru in a feed store robbery, Lula waits for him in the hotel room, trying to conceal that she is pregnant with Sailor's child. While Sailor is out Peru enters the room and forces Lula to implore him to make love with her, but in the end he refuses, stating he has no time. This traumatizes Lula, who had survived a rape as a child. | The robbery goes spectacularly wrong when Peru unnecessarily shoots the two clerks. Peru then admits to Sailor he's been hired to kill him and Sailor realizes he has been given a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is about to kill him when the sheriff's deputy opens fire on him and Peru accidentally blows his own head off with his own shotgun. Sailor is arrested and sentenced to six years in prison. | While Sailor is in jail, Lula has their child. Upon his release Lula decides to reunite with him. Rejecting her mother's objections over the phone, she throws water over her mother's photograph and goes to pick up Sailor with their son. When they meet Sailor, he reveals he will be leaving them both, having decided while in prison that he isn't good enough for them. While he is walking a short distance away, Sailor encounters a gang who surround him. He insults them and they quickly knock him out. While unconscious, he sees a vision in the form of Glinda the Good Witch, who tells him, \"Don't turn away from love, Sailor\". When he awakens, he apologizes to the men, tells them he realizes the error of his ways, then runs after Lula. The photograph of Marietta in Lula's house sizzles and vanishes. As there is a traffic jam on the road, Sailor begins to run over the roofs and hoods of the cars to get back to Lula and their child in the car. Sailor sings \"Love Me Tender\" to Lula, having earlier said that he would only sing that song to his wife.","m_cast":"Nicolas Cage as Sailor Ripley: The actor described his character as \"a kind of romantic Southern outlaw\".[6] Cage said in an interview that he was \"always attracted to those passionate, almost unbridled romantic characters, and Sailor had that more than any other role I'd played\".[6] Previous to being cast in the film, he had met Lynch several times at Hollywood eatery Musso & Frank Grill that they both frequented. When Lynch read Gifford's novel, he immediately wanted Cage to play Sailor.[7] | Laura Dern as Lula Pace Fortune: Dern had starred in a supporting role in Lynch's previous film, Blue Velvet. For Dern, this was the first opportunity she had \"to play not only a very sexual person, but also someone who also was, in her own way, incredibly comfortable with herself\".[6] When Lynch read Gifford's novel, he immediately thought of Dern to play Lula.[8] | Diane Ladd as Marietta Fortune, Lula's overbearing mother, who forbids Lula and Sailor's relationship; she forms a grudge against Sailor after he rejects her advances. Ladd and Dern are mother and daughter in real life.[9] | Harry Dean Stanton as Johnnie Farragut, a private detective and Marietta's boyfriend. This marks the first of multiple collaborations between Stanton and Lynch. | J. E. Freeman as Marcello Santos, a gangster and Marietta's other boyfriend. | W. Morgan Sheppard as Mr. Reindeer, a mysterious crime boss in league with Santos. | Willem Dafoe as Bobby Peru, a deranged criminal hired by Mr. Reindeer to kill Sailor. | Crispin Glover as Dell, Lula's mentally ill cousin who puts cockroaches in his underwear and has an unnatural obsession with Christmas. | Grace Zabriskie as Juana Durango, a criminal who works with Mr. Reindeer. | Isabella Rossellini as Perdita Durango, a criminal who once worked with Sailor and is now partners with Bobby Peru. Later the protagonist in the spinoff film Perdita Durango. | Sherilyn Fenn as Girl in car accident.

It wasn't Dino's fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that\".[2] Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch's and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on.[10] Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write.[11] He let Montgomery read it while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks in pre-published galley form. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it.[11] Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct.[12] Lynch remembers telling him, \"That’s great Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?\"[10] Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his \"kind of thing.\"[12] Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it.[11] Lynch remembers, \"It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened.\"[10] Lynch was drawn to what he saw as \"a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell,\" and was also attracted to \"a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about. So it seems truthful in some way.\"[10] | Lynch got approval from Propaganda to switch projects; however, production was scheduled to begin two months after the rights had been purchased, forcing the director to work fast.[13] He had Cage and Dern read Gifford's book[6] and wrote a draft in a week.[2][12] By Lynch's own admission, his first draft was \"depressing and pretty much devoid of happiness, and no one wanted to make it\".[14] Lynch did not like the ending in Gifford’s book where Sailor and Lula split up for good. For Lynch, \"it honestly didn’t seem real, considering the way they felt about each other. It didn’t seem one bit real! It had a certain coolness, but I couldn’t see it\".[10] It was at this point that the director's love of The Wizard of Oz (1939) began to influence the script he was writing and he included a reference to the \"yellow brick road\".[15] Lynch remembers, \"It was an awful tough world and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing\".[15] Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford’s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, \"much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, if I had not changed it, so that people wouldn’t say I was trying to be commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying\".[10] | Lynch also added new characters, like Mr. Reindeer and Sherilyn Fenn as the victim of a car accident.[16] During rehearsals, Lynch began talking about Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe with Cage and Dern.[17] The director acquired a copy of Elvis' Golden Records and after listening to it, called Cage and told him that he had to sing two songs, \"Love Me\" and \"Love Me Tender\". The actor agreed and recorded them so that he could lip-synch to them on the set. At one point, Cage called Lynch and asked if he could wear a snakeskin jacket in the film and Lynch incorporated it into his script.[17] Before filming started, Dern suggested that she and Cage go on a weekend road trip to Las Vegas in order to bond and get a handle on their characters.[12] Dern remembers, \"We agreed that Sailor and Lula needed to be one person, one character, and we would each share it. I got the sexual, wild, Marilyn, gum-chewing fantasy, female side; Nick’s got the snakeskin, Elvis, raw, combustible, masculine side\".[9] Within four months, Lynch began filming on August 9, 1989 in both Los Angeles (including the San Fernando Valley) and New Orleans with a relatively modest budget of $10 million.[2] Originally, the film featured more explicit erotic scenes between Sailor and Lula. In one, she has an orgasm while relating to Sailor a dream she had of being ripped open by a wild animal. Another deleted scene had Lula lowering herself onto Sailor's face saying, \"Take a bite out of Lula\".[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Wild at Heart  by Barry Gifford","m_directed_by":"David Lynch","m_produced_by":"Steve Golin | Monty Montgomery | Sigurjon Sighvatsson","m_screenplay_by":"David Lynch","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Nicolas Cage | Laura Dern | Willem Dafoe | Crispin Glover | Diane Ladd | Isabella Rossellini | Harry Dean Stanton","m_music_by":"Angelo Badalamenti","m_cinematography":"Frederick Elmes","m_edited_by":"Duwayne Dunham","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"The Samuel Goldwyn Company","m_release_dates":"May 25, 1990 (1990-05-25) (Cannes) | August 17, 1990 (1990-08-17) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"124 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$10 million[2]","m_box_office":"$14.6 million[3] | Wild at Heart is a 1990 American crime thriller[citation needed] film written and directed by David Lynch, and based on Barry Gifford's 1989 novel of the same name. Both the book and the film revolve around Sailor Ripley and Lula Pace Fortune, a young couple from Cape Fear, North Carolina who go on the run from her domineering mother and the gangsters she hires to kill Sailor. | Lynch was originally going to produce but after reading Gifford's book decided to also write and direct the film. He did not like the ending of the novel and decided to change it in order to fit his vision of the main characters. Wild at Heart is a road movie and includes several allusions to The Wizard of Oz as well as Elvis Presley and his movies.[4] | Early test screenings for the film did not go well; Lynch estimated that 80 people walked out of the first test screening and 100 in the next. At the time of its release, the film received mixed critical reviews and was a moderate success at the US box office, grossing USD$14 million, above its $10 million budget. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival,[5] at which it received both negative and positive attention from its audience. Diane Ladd was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. It has since received some positive re-evaluation from critics. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"WILD AT HEART (18)\". British Board of Film Classification. August 6, 1980.
