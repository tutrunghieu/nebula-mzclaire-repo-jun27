{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1977, in Montreal, the scared writer Wilbur Gray (Peter Cushing) visits his publisher Frank Richards (Ray Milland) to disclose his new book about the evilness of cats. Wilbur tells that the felines are supernatural creatures, and that there is a saying in which the cat would be the devil in disguise. Wilbur tells three tales to illustrate his thoughts: | In 1912, in London, Miss Malkin (Joan Greenwood) is a wealthy woman who rewrites her will leaving her fortune to her cats rather than to her nephew Michael (Simon Williams). Her maid Janet (Susan Penhaligon), also mistress of Michael, steals one copy of the will from the lawyer's briefcase and tries to destroy the original copy which is kept in the safe. When Miss Malkin sees her attempt, Janet kills her. The cats avenge Miss Malkin. | In 1975, in the Province of Quebec, the orphan Lucy (Katrina Holden) comes to live with her aunt Mrs. Blake (Alexandra Stewart), her husband (Donald Pilon), and her cousin Angela (Chloe Franks) after the death of her parents in a plane crash. Lucy brings her only friend, the cat Wellington, but her mean cousin forces her parents to get rid of Wellington. Lucy uses her mother's book of witchcraft to avenge Wellington. | In 1936, in Hollywood, the actor Valentine De'ath (Donald Pleasence) replaces the blade of a fake pendulum to kill his actress wife (Catherine Bégin), and give his young mistress and aspiring actress (Samantha Eggar) a chance. The cat of his wife avenges her.","m_cast":"Peter Cushing as Wilbur Gray | Ray Milland as Frank Richards | Samantha Eggar as Mrs. Edina Hamilton (segment \"Hollywood 1936\") | Donald Pleasence as Valentine De'ath (segment \"Hollywood 1936\") | John Vernon as Pomeroy (segment \"Hollywood 1936\") | Susan Penhaligon as Janet (segment \"London 1912\") | Alexandra Stewart as Mrs. Joan Blake (segment \"Quebec Province 1975\") | Joan Greenwood as Miss Malkin (segment \"London 1912\") | Roland Culver as Wallace (segment \"London 1912\") | Simon Williams as Michael (segment \"London 1912\") | Donald Pilon as Mr. Blake (segment \"Quebec Province 1975\") | Chloe Franks as Angela Blake (segment \"Quebec Province 1975\") | Katrina Holden Bronson as Lucy (segment \"Quebec Province 1975\") (as Katrina Holden) | Renée Girard as Mrs. Maitland (segment \"Quebec Province 1975\") | Catherine Bégin as Madeleine (segment \"Hollywood 1936\") | Jean LeClerc as Barrington (segment \"Hollywood 1936\") | Sean McCann as The Inspector (segment \"Hollywood 1936\")","m_reception":"The film performed poorly at the box office.[1]","m_production":"Filming started in Montreal on 16 November 1976.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Claude Héroux","m_produced_by":"René Dupont Milton Subotsky","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Cushing Ray Milland Donald Pleasence","m_music_by":"Wilfred Josephs","m_cinematography":"Denys N.
