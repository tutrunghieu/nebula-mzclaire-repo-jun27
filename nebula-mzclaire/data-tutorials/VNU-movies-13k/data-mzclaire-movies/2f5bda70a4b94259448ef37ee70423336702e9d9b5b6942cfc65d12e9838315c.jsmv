{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Rheinhardt, a cynical drifter, gets a job as an announcer for a Right Wing White supremacists radio station WUSA in New Orleans. Rheinhardt is content to parrot WUSA's reactionary editorial stance on the air, even if he does not agree with it. Rheinhardt finds his cynical detachment challenged by a lady friend, Geraldine, and by Rainey, a neighbor and troubled idealist who becomes aware of WUSA's sinister, hidden purpose.

I suspect Stone wins out, for WUSA feels more like poor theater than poor moviemaking—so, that it continually suggests a failed version of The Balcony, even though it strives to fall short of The Manchurian Candidate. ... Despite its obsession with collecting evidence, and its handy school of pseudo-documentary, WUSA fights unreal battles with an unseen enemy. Lacking either the grace of art of the vitality of guerrilla theater, it can offer only the coarsest nourishment—and only to the elaborately self-deceived.\" [3]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stuart Rosenberg","m_produced_by":"John Foreman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Paul Newman Joanne Woodward Anthony Perkins Laurence Harvey","m_music_by":"Lalo Schifrin","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"1970 (1970) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"115 min.","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | WUSA is a 1970 American drama film, directed by Stuart Rosenberg.
