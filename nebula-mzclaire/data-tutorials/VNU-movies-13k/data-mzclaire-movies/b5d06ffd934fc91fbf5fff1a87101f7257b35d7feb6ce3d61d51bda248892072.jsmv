{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the future, robots known as Sentinels are exterminating mutants and their human allies. The Sentinels are near invincible as they possess Mystique's powers of transformation. This technology was made possible following research performed on Mystique when she was captured during the assassination of Dr. Bolivar Trask, creator of the Sentinels. A band of mutants, including Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Iceman, Bishop, Warpath, Blink and Sunspot, convene with Wolverine, Storm, Professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto in a hideout in remote China. Pryde sends Wolverine's consciousness back fifty years to 1973 to prevent Mystique from assassinating Trask, which led to her capture and revealed the threat that mutants could pose to normal humans. | At the X-Mansion in 1973, Wolverine encounters Xavier and Hank McCoy. Xavier, a broken man, has been overusing a serum that allows him to walk but suppresses his telepathy. Wolverine explains his mission and persuades Xavier to help free Magneto from a prison cell beneath The Pentagon, where he is being held for assassinating President John F. Kennedy. They rescue Magneto with the help of Peter Maximoff, a mutant with super speed. | In Washington, D.C., Trask unsuccessfully tries to sway Congress to gain support for his Sentinel program. Meanwhile, in Saigon, Mystique prevents William Stryker from appropriating a group of mutant G.I.s for Trask's research. Xavier, Magneto, Beast, and Wolverine fly to Paris to intercept Mystique, who is impersonating a North Vietnamese general to infiltrate the Paris Peace Accords. The group arrives as Mystique is about to kill Trask. Magneto tries to kill Mystique to ensure her DNA cannot be used for the Sentinels, but she escapes. The fight spills onto the street in view of the public, allowing Magneto and Mystique to escape. | Trask is saved, but the world is horrified by the existence of mutants. President Richard Nixon approves Trask's Sentinel program and arranges an unveiling ceremony. Trask's scientists recover Mystique's blood from the street. Meanwhile, Magneto—who has recovered his telepathy-blocking helmet—intercepts the prototype Sentinels in transit and laces their polymer-based frames with steel, enabling him to control them. At the mansion, Xavier stops taking his serum and slowly regains his telepathic powers, while losing the ability to walk. Through Wolverine, Xavier speaks to his future self and is inspired to work for peace between humans and mutants once again. He uses Cerebro to track Mystique, who is heading to Washington, D.C. | As Xavier, Wolverine, and Beast search for Mystique, Nixon unveils the Sentinel prototypes at the White House. Magneto commandeers the Sentinels and attacks the crowd, then sets the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium around the White House as a barricade. Nixon and Trask, accompanied by the Cabinet, Secret Service officers, and Mystique (disguised as a Secret Service member), are taken to a safe room. Wolverine and Beast try to stop Magneto, but he pits a Sentinel against them and then throws Wolverine into the Potomac River. In the future, the X-Men make their final stand as a large army of Sentinels attack the monastery. In 1973, Magneto pulls the safe room from the White House and prepares to kill Nixon and his Cabinet. Mystique, who is disguised as Nixon, incapacitates Magneto with a plastic gun. Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask and allows her and Magneto to flee. Mystique's actions are seen as a mutant saving the President, leading to the cancellation of the Sentinel program. Trask is arrested for trying to sell American military secrets. In the future, Mystique's actions save Xavier, Magneto, and Pryde just as a group of Sentinels reach them. | Wolverine wakes up back in the future to find Iceman, Rogue, Colossus, Pryde, Beast, Storm, Jean Grey, Scott Summers, and Xavier all alive. He then proceeds to explain to Xavier about his experience. In 1973, Mystique, impersonating Stryker, takes custody of Wolverine, who has been fished out of the river. | In a post-credits scene, a crowd chants to En Sabah Nur, who is using telekinesis to build pyramids as four horsemen watch from nearby.[6][7]","m_cast":"Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine | James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier / Professor X | Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto | Jennifer Lawrence as Raven Darkhölme / Mystique | Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe / Storm | Nicholas Hoult and Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy / Beast | Anna Paquin as Marie / Rogue | Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde / Shadowcat | Peter Dinklage as Bolivar Trask | Shawn Ashmore as Bobby Drake / Iceman | Omar Sy as Bishop | Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver | Josh Helman as Major William Stryker | Daniel Cudmore as Peter Rasputin / Colossus | Fan Bingbing as Blink | Adan Canto as Sunspot | Booboo Stewart as Warpath | Additionally, Famke Janssen and James Marsden reprise their roles as Jean Grey and Scott Summers / Cyclops respectively in cameo appearances.

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 91% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 284 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past combines the best elements of the series to produce a satisfyingly fast-paced outing that ranks among the franchise's finest installments\".[159] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 74 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[160] | Sean O'Connell of Cinema Blend gave the film four and a half stars out of five, and said it was \"the greatest, most complete and staggeringly entertaining [X-Men film] to date\".[161] Empire gave it four out of five stars and called it, \"The best X-Men film since the second one\".[162] Steve Rose of The Guardian rated the film three stars out of five; he said, \"Non-devotees might struggle, but director Bryan Singer whips up the action towards a symphonic climax\".[163] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe.\"[164] Justin Chang of Variety said, \"If the characters' quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they're also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling over the course of the film’s fleet 130-minute [sic] running time\".[165] | In contrast, Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph rated the film two stars out of five and called the plot \"a curate's egg, thoroughly scrambled\". He concluded, \"The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It seems to have been constructed in a stupor, and you watch in a daze of future past.\"[166] Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a \"visually driven and paint-by-numbers-plot\". Abrams was critical of the undeveloped subplots that built up because the film's pacing left little time to develop each element of the story set in the 1970s.[167]","m_production":"Producer Lauren Shuler Donner stated in August 2006 that a continuation of the X-Men main film series would require a renegotiation. New cast members of X-Men: The Last Stand were signed, while the older cast members were not.[41] Donner said, \"There is forty years worth of stories. I've always wanted to do 'Days of Future Past' and there are just really a lot of stories yet to be told.\"[42] She later pitched the idea of a fourth installment of the X-Men franchise to director Bryan Singer, following the completion of the 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class.[43] In March 2011, Donner said the film was in \"active development at Fox\"; she said, \"We took the treatment to Fox and they love it... And X4 leads into X5\".[44] | 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as the first film of a new X-Men trilogy.[45] Donner compared the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series.[46] Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively.[47] While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, \"First Class is similar to Batman Begins, where you have the fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.\"[48] Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, \"I thought it would be fun to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto.\"[49] Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War,[50] and that Wolverine could once again be featured.[51] Singer also talked about \"changing history\" in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past \"erasing\" the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.[52] | Kinberg said the main focus of this film was the future of the X-Men film series. With the use of cast members from the original trilogy and from First Class, they needed to decide the sequels' destination.[15] In preparation for the film, Kinberg studied films about time travel, including Back to the Future, The Terminator, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Singer originated a philosophy and a set of rules for the time travel in the film so the story would be as plausible as possible.[15] | According to Kinberg, as they were writing the script, they thought it is sensible that Wolverine was traveling between time periods, because of his ageless look and ability to heal rapidly.[15] He further stated of making Wolverine the time traveler, \"We made the decision for a lot of reasons ... he's the protagonist of the franchise, and probably the most beloved character to a mass audience.\"[53] Kinberg and Vaughn considered Bishop and Cable candidates for the role of time traveler.[9] Kinberg said Rachel Summers was in the first draft of the script; she sent Wolverine back to 1973. The character was later replaced with Kitty Pryde, to whom Kinberg gave a secondary power of sending people's consciousnesses into the past.[54] Juggernaut, Jubilee, Nightcrawler and Psylocke were also considered for the film.[55][56][57][58] | Singer was asked how the film integrates the themes of the earlier X-Men films; he said, \"It establishes that some villain characters may have been right with their fears. It confronts the notions of hope and second chances. It's characters that are lost trying to find themselves. In X-Men 1 and 2, the characters had come into their own and knew who they were. In this one, they're all lost and they're trying to keep it together.\"[59] | In November 2011, Simon Kinberg—co-writer of X-Men: The Last Stand and co-producer of X-Men: First Class—was hired to write the film's screenplay.[60] In May 2012, 20th Century Fox announced the film would be released on July 18, 2014.[61] The release was later moved forward to May 23, 2014.[62] In August 2012, the title for the film was confirmed to be X-Men: Days of Future Past. The film is inspired by Chris Claremont and John Byrne's X-Men comic book storyline, \"Days of Future Past\", which introduced the idea of an alternate future for mutants that grew from the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants' killing of a senator, leading to a future in which mutants are hunted by Sentinels.[63] | In October 2012, Vaughn left the role of director to focus on Mark Millar's Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014).[64] Singer was later announced as the film's director; it was his third directorial role in the X-Men film series.[65] In preparation for the film, Singer approached James Cameron to discuss time travel, string theory and multiverses.[66] In the same month, Richard Stammers was approached to be the visual effects supervisor, as Singer liked his work in the 2012 film Prometheus.[67] | In December 2012, John Myhre and Louise Mingenbach were hired as production designer and costume designer, respectively. According to Singer, Mingenbach—who worked on X-Men, X2 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine—will not produce the black leather costumes that were worn in the original trilogy.[68][69] In February 2013, John Ottman—who collaborated on all of Singer's works since the 1995 film The Usual Suspects—was confirmed to work on the music and the editing of the film.[70] | \"I decided that the next time I got myself involved in a movie that had a huge amount of attention already that I would use Twitter. As a way of connecting with fans, principally. And also as a way of clearing up misunderstandings so that people know. You know, they may hear that an actor is cast or hear somebody is going to be in it, but until I say it's so, that's the confirmation.\"[71] | Singer used the online social networking service Twitter to announce casting of the film.[71] In November 2012, he announced that James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult would reprise their roles from X-Men: First Class. Later the same month, he announced that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen would reprise their respective roles as the older versions of the characters played by McAvoy and Fassbender.[72][73][74] In December, Singer announced that Hugh Jackman would reprise his role as Wolverine.[75] | In January 2013, Singer announced that Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashmore, and Ellen Page would reprise their roles of Rogue, Iceman, and Kitty Pryde.[76][77] In February, Singer announced that Peter Dinklage would star in the film as the main antagonist.[78] In March, Singer announced that French actor Omar Sy had joined the cast.[79] Halle Berry said in an interview that she would reprise her role as Storm, which was followed by an announcement from Singer that Berry would be in the film.[80][81] Singer tweeted a picture of the cast, which confirmed that Daniel Cudmore would return as Colossus and that Fan Bingbing and Booboo Stewart had joined the cast.[82] | In April, Singer announced that American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga had joined the cast as Dazzler,[83] but it was later revealed as an April Fools' Day prank.[71] Singer retweeted a photograph of himself, Adan Canto, and confirmed cast members Patrick Stewart, McKellen, and Ashmore, which was followed by a confirmation from Canto that he had joined the cast.[84] In May, Singer announced that Evan Peters had been cast as Quicksilver.[85] In June, Australian actor Josh Helman was cast in a role.[86] In July, Singer tweeted a picture of actor Lucas Till on the set of the film, which confirmed that he was returning as Havok.[87] In January 2014, Evan Jonigkeit had been cast as the younger version of Toad.[88] | Louise Mingenbach designed costumes inspired by 1970s styles for the characters in the 1973 scenes. Hoult wore corduroys, Jackman a wooden-paneled buckle and a peacock-print shirt, and McAvoy wore a brown leather jacket. Peters wore 1981-inspired clothing; this was Mingenbach's way of showing Quicksilver's irreverence for the exact time and place. In one scene, Mingenbach gave Fassbender as the younger Erik Lehnsherr a fedora as a nod to the one the character wore in the first X-Men film.[89] | For the future period of the film, Mingenbach wanted a darker, slightly futuristic and tactical look for the characters. In the previous X-Men films, Patrick Stewart wore suits; Singer thought that it would be distracting to see Xavier in a suit, so Mingenbach costumed him in battle fatigues.[89] | Lawrence as Mystique wore a body suit with prosthetic scales attached; a zipper in the back was digitally removed in post-production.[citation needed] | X-Men: Days of Future Past had a production budget of $200 million.[4] Principal photography began on April 15, 2013, at Mel's Cité du Cinema in Montreal, Canada, and ended on August 17, 2013.[90][91][92] Filming had to begin in April 2013 to accommodate the cast's individual schedules.[15] Olympic Stadium, Montreal City Hall, and McGill University were also used as filming locations.[93][94] An aerial plate unit was sent to film in Washington, D.C.[67] Additional filming took place in Montreal in November 2013 and February 2014.[95][96] According to the Calgary Herald, the film is the second most expensive produced by 20th Century Fox after Avatar (2009).[97] Comic book writer Chris Claremont said in an interview that he was consulted for the film.[98] | X-Men: Days of Future Past is the first X-Men film to be filmed in native 3D; it was shot using Arri Alexa-M cameras with Leica Prime lenses and Fujinon Zoom lenses, along with 3ality Technica TS-35 camera rigs and Stereo Image Processor (SIP) technology systems.[99][100] Director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel was asked about using Arri Alexa-M cameras; he said, \"For Bryan and myself, the Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film\". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.[101] | John Myhre, who worked on the first X-Men film, rebuilt the blue underground hallways and Cerebro sets from the first film. He also added Xs to the film sets, including the staircase of the X-Mansion. He said he wanted to embrace the 1970s setting in the same way First Class embraced its 1960s setting.[15] | The Sentinels had two separate versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s evolved into the adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future.[102] Singer described the 1973 version as \"a little fun and stylish but also a little retro\", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period,[15] and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and \"those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels\". The overall style was bulky to fit \"the traditional idea of a robot looks like\",[102] and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design.[103] The robots' ability to fly was compared to a Harrier Jump Jet, as the Sentinels had vertical takeoff and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by Legacy Effects to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding woof effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.[102] | On the other hand, the future Sentinels would resemble \"giant versions of Mystique\" to show how their technological development was based on studying the shapeshifting mutant's DNA. Thus their design is sleek and feminine, with a body covered in mechanical scales that move during the process of adapting to a mutant's attack, while also featuring angular and dark faces to enhance the intimidation. The future robots would feature what Singer described as \"biomechanical technology to transform to adapt to other mutants, to take on their physicality and some of their powers to use against mutantkind\", which the director imagined to be fueled by nanotechnology and \"the ability to really change things almost at a molecular level.” The Sentinels' heads would also open up as an extra weapon, and for straighter combat the robots could create blades and spikes out of their limbs. The crackling sound of the robots' scales was made by rubbing riveted belts on shale rocks.[13][102] | For the future setting of the film, a set featuring a hillside monastery was built. Myhre was inspired by Chinese temples built on the sides of cliffs. The future set also featured a mixture of architectural styles from China, India, and Indonesia. Part of the set was a big wall, which was inspired by the Great Wall of China.[103] | X-Men: Days of Future Past had 1,311 visual effects shots produced by twelve studios. Richard Stammer served as the overall effects supervisor based on his work for Prometheus.[67] The leading company was Digital Domain, with effects from the 1973 portion that encompassed nearly a third of the work. These included the Sentinels, Mystique's transformations and eyes, and various digital environments. Digital augmentation turned a remote airstrip into a Vietnam prisoner camp and added Paris' famed mansard rooftops to the Montreal locations. The environment work based on Washington, D.C. required the team to study period references of the National Mall and White House, and photograph almost all of RFK Stadium to create a detailed digital replica.[104] Another major contributor was Moving Picture Company, who created the future Sentinels and worked on the sequences involving the X-Jet and Cerebro's red virtual world.[67] The Sentinels' scaled bodies were created by adapting a tool originally developed to create hair and fur, which would later evolve into creating a proxy representation of each individual scale as a \"follicle\".[13] Rising Sun Pictures created a sequence considered by many reviewers the centerpiece of the film's effects, where Quicksilver uses his super speed in the Pentagon kitchen. Depicting how, to a speedster, actions in real time come down to a virtual standstill, objects float around in slow motion. After doing LIDAR scan of the kitchen set, the digital recreation added many computer generated props - cooking gear, cutlery, vegetables and water released by a fire sprinkler system - rendered in near microscopic detail regarding placement and lighting, particularly because the footage had to work in 3D. To simulate Quicksilver running on the walls, Evan Peters and a stunt double were filmed in both the set being suspended by a harness and on a treadmill that stood in front of a chroma key green screen. Only Peters' legs were digitally replaced.[13][105] Despite the sequence only having 29 effects shots,[67] it required nearly seven months of work from RSP's team of 70 artists.[106] Rhythm and Hues Studios worked on Beast's transformations, the creation of Xavier's plane, and speed effects for Quicksilver. They also worked with Digital Domain on the sequence featuring the inside of the 1973 Sentinel. Mokko Studio worked on Mystique's eyes and costume fixes. Cinesite worked on the future New York City in the opening prologue along with clean-ups, wire removals, and production fixes. Fuel VFX worked on holographic effects and Havok's mutant powers. Vision Globale worked on visual effects relating to a dream and flashback sequence. Hydraulx, Lola and Method Studios handled a number of compositions and production fixes. The Third Floor worked on extensive story-boarding and visualisation.[67]","m_sequel":"In December 2013, Singer announced X-Men: Apocalypse, an X-Men film acting as a sequel to X-Men: Days of Future Past.[184] Singer direcedt from a script by Simon Kinberg, Dan Harris, and Michael Dougherty.[185] According to Singer, the next film focuses on the origin of the mutants.[186] Kinberg said it would take place in 1983 and would also complete a trilogy that began with X-Men: First Class.[58][187] Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Evan Peters, Rose Byrne, Lucas Till and Hugh Jackman reprise their roles, with Oscar Isaac, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Alexandra Shipp, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Ben Hardy, Lana Condor, and Olivia Munn joining the cast.[188][189][190][191] Filming began in April 2015 in Montreal, Quebec for a May 27, 2016, release.[184][192]","m_based_on":"Days of Future Past  by Chris Claremont John Byrne","m_directed_by":"Bryan Singer","m_produced_by":"Lauren Shuler Donner | Bryan Singer | Simon Kinberg | Hutch Parker","m_screenplay_by":"Simon Kinberg","m_story_by":"Simon Kinberg | Jane Goldman | Matthew Vaughn","m_starring":"Hugh Jackman | James McAvoy | Michael Fassbender | Jennifer Lawrence | Halle Berry | Anna Paquin | Ellen Page | Peter Dinklage | Ian McKellen | Patrick Stewart","m_music_by":"John Ottman","m_cinematography":"Newton Thomas Sigel","m_edited_by":"John Ottman","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"May 10, 2014 (2014-05-10) (Javits Center) | May 23, 2014 (2014-05-23) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"131 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States[2][3]","m_language":"English Vietnamese","m_budget":"$200 million[4][5]","m_box_office":"$747.9 million[4] | X-Men: Days of Future Past is a 2014 American superhero film based on the fictional X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics.
