The film ended its theatrical run with a total domestic gross of $17,186.[7] | Violet & Daisy received generally negative reviews with many critics complaining that it was yet another Quentin Tarantino knock-off. The film garnered a 22% percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews.[8] Violet & Daisy received a 43 out of 100 on the website Metacritic.[9] Matt Zoller Seitz from Roger Ebert.com gave the film 2 out of 4 stars stating \"Gandolfini's quietly magnificent performance is the only reason to see \"Violet & Daisy,\" a thriller that might as well have been released in 1996, when everybody and their brother and their sister and their cousin twice-removed was trying to be Quentin Tarantino, writing screenplays about loquacious hit men and gangsters and molls delivering cutesy monologues in wacky, not-quite-real universes\".[10] A. O. Scott of The New York Times reviewed the film stating \"We don't feel the weight and menace of death, nor the volatile emotions of youth, and have nothing to respond to beyond the spectacle of girls with guns\". [11] Christopher Campbell of Film School Rejects gave the movie a B- stating \"Hardly a follow-up that will have [Fletcher] garnering more awards. Not because it's bad; it's just really cartoony, as in artificial, two-dimensional and rather childish\".[12] Cammila Collar of TV Guide gave the film 3 out of 4 stars stating \"Violet & Daisy is a cool movie. It's strange and ambitious and affecting and extremely well-acted throughout a thoroughly esoteric script\".[13] Jeffrey M. Anderson of Common Sense Media gave the film 3 out of 5 stars stating \"Though it can't keep up that kind of energy throughout, especially as it's set mostly in one room, it's charming enough -- and short enough -- that there are no hard feelings\".[14] Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film 2 out of 4 stars stating \"The film's subtle visual allure is all but stamped out by the impression that the director tries too hard to be an idiosyncratic auteur in the vein of Quentin Tarantino\".[15]","m_production":"Bruce Willis was considered for the role of The Guy before James Gandolfini was cast. Carey Mulligan was originally cast in the role of Violet but opted to do Drive instead and so she dropped out.
