{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a Los Angeles literature professor with a severe gambling addiction caused by his view of the world as either having it all or having nothing. This view goes unchanged even after the death of his grandfather, Ed (George Kennedy), who names Bennett his successor just before dying. Bennett ends up owing $240,000 to Lee (Alvin Ing), the proprietor of an underground gambling ring, and another $50,000 to Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams), a loan shark. Lee gives Bennett seven days to pay off his debts or be murdered. | During one of his classes, Bennett identifies student Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) as a potential writing prodigy, having previously encountered her as a waitress at the gambling house. Bennett also singles out Dexter (Emory Cohen), a genius tennis star, and confronts Lamar Allen (Anthony Kelley), a student who does not pay attention in class and intends to become an NBA basketball player. Amy develops a personal interest in the professor. | Bennett considers borrowing money from Frank (John Goodman), another loan shark, to consolidate his debts and buy himself some time, but refuses to do so after Frank's demands include that Bennett admit, \"I am not a man.\" Bennett convinces his mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) to give him enough money to pay off his debts, expressing no gratitude to her, then during a trip to a casino with Amy gambles it all away. Baraka kidnaps Bennett, has him beaten and forces him into an ultimatum—if he does not convince Lamar to win one of his college basketball games by a margin of 7 points or less, he will murder Amy. | Bennett goes to Frank, who advises him to adopt a \"fuck you\" attitude towards life by getting enough money to be completely free. Frank lends him $260,000 to pay his debt to Lee, but also threatens to kill everyone in Bennett's personal life if he is not repaid. Lee's men assault Bennett when he comes to ask Lee to stake him $150,000, saying the only way he can pay his full $410,000 debt to Lee and Frank is to gamble and win. He uses the $150,000 to bribe Lamar into going along with the basketball point-shaving scheme. Bennett sends Dexter to Las Vegas to bet on the game with the $260,000 he got from Frank. Lamar succeeds, barely, so Bennett uses his winnings to pay his debt to Baraka, denying he knows anything about the large bet made in Vegas. | Bennett then convinces both Lee and Frank to meet him in a neutral gambling den, where he wagers enough money to pay both men off—if he wins—on a single roulette spin. Successful, he leaves the money at the club for Lee and Frank. The payment to Frank is more than he owed, but he refuses to take the \"cream\" when Frank offers to give back the overpayment. Bennett runs through the city to Amy's apartment, broke but free.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Gambler received a rating of 45%, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10.
