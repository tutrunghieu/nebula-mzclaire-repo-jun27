When no one on the street will talk to him, he fabricates a story of a pimp that's so well-received it puts his career back on track. However, the Police and the District Attorney think the story is of a real pimp who is wanted for murder and start pressuring him to reveal the identity of his subject. Fast Black (Morgan Freeman), a pimp and police suspect, also believes that the story is about him and wants to know who betrayed him to Jonathan. From there a battle of wits and wills ensues between Jonathan and Fast Black, in addition to Jonathan becoming involved with one of the pimp's call girls, Punchy (Kathy Baker).","m_cast":"Christopher Reeve as Jonathan Fisher | Morgan Freeman as Leo Smalls, Jr. a.k.a.
