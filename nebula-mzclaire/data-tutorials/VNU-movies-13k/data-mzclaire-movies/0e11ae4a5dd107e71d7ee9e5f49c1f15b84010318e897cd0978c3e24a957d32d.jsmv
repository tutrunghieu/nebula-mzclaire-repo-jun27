{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Freelance assassin Hawkins (Sim) has plans to blow up Sir Gregory Upshott, a Cabinet minister (Huntley) when the latter is discovered to be having an affair, about to be consummated at the Green Man Hotel. However his plans are accidentally uncovered and foiled by vacuum cleaner salesman Blake (Cole) who forges an unlikely alliance with Ann (Adams), engaged to be married to a rather stuffy BBC announcer, Willoughby-Cruft (Gordon). The latter relationship breaks down when Willoughby-Cruft finds his fianc√©e under their bed with Blake and later, in her lingerie, accidentally entangled on the floor with him. As such, there are some romantic (and not-at-all romantic) interludes and Hawkins briefly has the task of trying to deal with Upshott's secretary, a friendly policeman, and prepare his bomb at the same time.","m_cast":"Alastair Sim as Harry Hawkins | George Cole as William Blake | Terry-Thomas as Charles Boughtflower | Jill Adams as Ann Vincent | Raymond Huntley as Sir Gregory Upshott | Colin Gordon as Reginald Willoughby-Cruft | Avril Angers as Marigold | Dora Bryan as Lily | John Chandos as McKechnie | Cyril Chamberlain as Police Sergeant Bassett | Richard Wattis as Doctor | Lucy Griffiths as Annabel | Arthur Brough as Landlord | Arthur Lowe as Radio salesman | Eileen Moore as Sir Gregory's weekend companion, Joan Moore | Alexander Gauge as Chairman | Peter Bull as General Niva | Willoughby Goddard as Statesman | Michael Ripper as Waiter | Marie Burke as Felicity","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Cole's then wife, Eileen Moore, appeared in the film as the typist with whom Upshott has a liaison. | The film, rated U, has been re-released on Region 2 DVD with School for Scoundrels.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Day Basil Dearden","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Alastair Sim George Cole Terry-Thomas Jill Adams","m_music_by":"Cedric Thorpe Davie","m_cinematography":"Gerald Gibbs","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"1956","m_running_time":null,"m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Green Man is a 1956 British black comedy film based on the play Meet a Body by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, who produced and adapted the big-screen version. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Green Man at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/The_greenman_movieposter.jpg/220px-The_greenman_movieposter.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Frank Launder Sidney Gilliat"}
