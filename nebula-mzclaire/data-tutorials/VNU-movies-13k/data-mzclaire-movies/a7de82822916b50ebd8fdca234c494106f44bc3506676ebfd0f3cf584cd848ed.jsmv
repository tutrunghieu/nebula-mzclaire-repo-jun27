Vince, a drug dealer/volunteer firefighter from Oakland, rents the room in his hometown to support his old high school friend's entry into the Lansing Film Festival. | His friend, documentary filmmaker Jon Salter, joins Vince in his motel room and the two reminisce about their high school years. At first, the two are happy to see one another, but friction soon develops. Eventually, they get on the subject of Amy, Vince's former girlfriend. It appears that, while they dated for some time, Vince and Amy never had sex. However, after or at the point when their relationship had ended, Amy slept with Jon. | Vince claims Amy had told him that Jon had raped her. Vince becomes obsessed with, and eventually succeeds in getting a verbal confession from Jon. Immediately after Jon's admission, Vince pulls out a hidden tape recorder that had been recording their whole conversation, much to Jon's horror. Vince then tells Jon that he has invited Amy to dinner, and that she will be arriving shortly. | Eventually Amy does arrive and, even though all three of them feel awkward, they begin to talk. Amy explains that she is now an assistant district attorney in the Lansing Justice Department. Eventually, the three discuss what actually happened between Jon and Amy that night at the party, 10 years in the past. | Jon asks Amy's forgiveness for raping her, but Amy claims that the encounter was consensual, leading Jon to believe that she is in denial or is toying with him. After Jon becomes annoyed that Amy is refusing to accept his apology, Amy calls the police. She asks for a squad car to pick up one person in possession of drugs (Vince), and one in relation to a verifiable rape (Jon). After concluding her phone call, Amy warns the men that they only have about four minutes to make a run for it. | In order to prove to Amy that he is truly remorseful, Jon decides to stay and wait for the police. Vince, realizing that there is nowhere for him to run, flushes his narcotics down the toilet and destroys the tape containing Jon's confession. Soon after, Amy reveals that she didn't really call the police and leaves.","m_cast":"Ethan Hawke as Vince | Robert Sean Leonard as Jon Salter | Uma Thurman as Amy Randall","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Tape  by Stephen Belber","m_directed_by":"Richard Linklater","m_produced_by":"Gary Winick Anne Walker-McBay Alexis Alexanian","m_screenplay_by":"Stephen Belber","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ethan Hawke Robert Sean Leonard Uma Thurman","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Maryse Alberti","m_edited_by":"Sandra Adair","m_production_company":"Tape Productions","m_distributed_by":"Lionsgate","m_release_dates":"January 26, 2001 (2001-01-26) (Sundance) | November 2, 2001 (2001-11-02) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"86 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$100,000[2]","m_box_office":"$515,900[3] | Tape is a 2001 American camcorder drama film directed by Richard Linklater and written by Stephen Belber, based on his play of the same name.
