{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), a teacher and football coach from South Carolina, is asked by his mother, Lila, to travel to New York to help his twin sister's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand), after his sister Savannah's (Melinda Dillon) latest suicide attempt. Tom hates New York and reluctantly accepts, but largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and an overly proud, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at that profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty. | Tom is also torn with his own problems, but hides behind what he calls \"the Southern way\"; i.e., laughing about everything. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin having feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard (Jason Gould), who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. Tom discovers that Savannah has been in such a dissociated state that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner and their relationship becomes closer. | Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. Tom reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, along with his mother and sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom suffers a mental breakdown, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah's troubled life. After a session of football, Herbert orders Bernard to return to his music lessons and prepare to leave for Tanglewood. Tom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein's home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom's sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband's affairs. Tom takes Herbert's \"million dollar\" violin and threatens to throw it off the balcony unless Herbert apologizes. | Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is about to be released from the hospital when Tom realizes that he wants to be closer to his wife and children, despite having fallen in love with someone else. He returns home, but his last thoughts are of Lowenstein.","m_cast":"Nick Nolte as Tom Wingo | Barbra Streisand as Dr. Susan Lowenstein | Blythe Danner as Sally Wingo | Kate Nelligan as Lila Wingo Newbury | Melinda Dillon as Savannah Wingo | Jeroen Krabbé as Herbert Woodruff, Lowenstein's husband | George Carlin as Eddie Detreville, Savannah's homosexual neighbor | Jason Gould as Bernard Woodruff, Lowenstein's son (and Streisand's real life son with Elliott Gould) | Brad Sullivan as Henry Wingo","m_reception":"Pat Conroy, author of the novel \"The Prince of Tides\", gave Streisand a copy of his novel with the inscription:\"To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides...you are many things, Barbra, but you're also a great teacher...one of the greatest to come into my life. I honor the great teachers and they live in my work and they dance invisibly in the margins of my prose. You've honored me by taking care of it with such great seriousness and love. Great thanks, and I'll never forget that you gave 'The Prince of Tides' back to me as a gift. Pat Conroy. \" [3] | Roger Ebert gave the film three and 1/2 stars of four stars, praising Streisand's directing \"By directing one good film, you prove that you had a movie inside of you. By directing two, you prove you are a real director\", \"an assured and very serious love story that allows neither humor nor romance to get in the way of its deeper and darker subject.\", \"Streisand shows herself as a director who likes emotional stories - but doesn't simplify them, and pays attention to the human quirks and strangeness of her characters\".[4] | Variety (magazine) called it \"A deeply moving exploration of the tangled emotions of a dysfunctional Southern family, this lovingly crafted (though unevenly scripted) film of Pat Conroy’s novel centers on Nick Nolte’s performance of a lifetime. Bringing her usual strengths of character to her role as Nolte’s psychiatrist/lover, Barbra Streisand marks every frame with the intensity and care of a filmmaker committed to heartfelt, unashamed emotional involvement with her characters\".[5] | Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader commented, \"The results may seem overripe and dated in spots, but (Streisand) coaxes a fine performance out of Nolte, and the other actors (herself included) acquit themselves honorably \".[6] | The Prince of Tides was a critical and box office success, opening at number four with a grossing of $10,035,412 behind Hook, Beauty and the Beast, and Father of the Bride, and remained in the top 10 for seven weeks.[7] Eventually the final gross was $74,787,599.[8] $36,100,000 in rentals accumulated, and gave the film a final gross of $110 million. It's among the top 20 highest grossing films of the year at the box office. | Although the film, its cast, and its crew received many nominations for Academy Awards, Best Director was not among these, while Best Picture was. At the following year's Oscar ceremonies, host Billy Crystal sang, to the tune of \"Don't Rain on My Parade,\" \"did this film direct itself? \"[9] The following year, when A Few Good Men joined Prince of Tides and the previous year's Awakenings in being nominated for the latter award, but not the former, Columbia Pictures president Mark Canton issued a statement, \"This is unfortunately the third year in a row that Columbia has had a film nominated for Best Picture that seemingly directed itself.\"[10] | Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama - Nick Nolte | Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor- Nick Nolte | Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor- Nick Nolte | Academy Award for Best Picture[11] | Academy Award for Best Actor - Nick Nolte[12] | Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress - Kate Nelligan | Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay - Becky Johnston and Pat Conroy | Academy Award for Best Art Direction – Set Decoration - Paul Sylbert and Caryl Heller | Academy Award for Best Cinematography - Stephen Goldblatt | Academy Award for Original Music Score - James Newton Howard | Golden Globe Award for Best Director - Barbra Streisand | Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama | Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures - Barbra Streisand | WGA Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium - Becky Johnston and Pat Conroy | American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases - Stephen Goldblatt","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Prince of Tides  by Pat Conroy","m_directed_by":"Barbra Streisand[1]","m_produced_by":"Barbra Streisand Andrew S.
