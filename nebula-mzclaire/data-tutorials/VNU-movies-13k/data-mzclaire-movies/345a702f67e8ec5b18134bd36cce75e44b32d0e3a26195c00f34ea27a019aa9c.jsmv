{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On Christmas Eve, in London, Charles Dickens (played by The Great Gonzo) and his friend Rizzo act as narrators throughout the film. Ebenezer Scrooge, a mean money-lender, does not share the merriment of Christmas Day. Scrooge rejects his nephew Fred’s invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen’s collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol singing Bean Bunny. His loyal employee Bob Cratchit and the other bookkeepers request to have Christmas Day off, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. Scrooge leaves for home while the bookkeepers celebrate Christmas Day. In his house, Scrooge encounters the ghosts of his late business partners Jacob and Robert Marley, who warn him to repent his wicked ways or he will condemned in the afterlife like they were, informing him that 3 time-travelling spirits will visit him during the night. | At 1 o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life, Dickens and Rizzo hitching a ride too. They visit his lonely school days, and then his time as an employee under Fozziwig, who owned a rubber chicken factory. Fozziwig and his mother throw a Christmas party, Scrooge attending and meets a young woman named Belle, whom he falls in love with. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him when he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge dismisses the Ghost as he returns to the present. | At 2 o'clock, Scrooge meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Bob’s house, learning his family is surprisingly content with their small dinner, Scrooge taking pity on Bob’s ill son Tiny Tim. The Ghost of Christmas Present abruptly ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely not survive until next Christmas. Scrooge and the Ghost go to a cemetery, where the latter fades away, informing Scrooge that the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come will arrive shortly. A fog fills the cemetery, revealing the third and last Ghost, who appears as a tall, silent cloaked figure. While The Great Gonzo and Rizzo abandon the audience to avoid being scared, the Ghost takes Scrooge into the [not too distant] future. | Scrooge and the Ghost witness 4 pig businessmen, each standing underneath their umbrellas, discussing the death of an unnamed colleague where they would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided. Inside a den, Scrooge recognizes his charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker trading several stolen possessions of the deceased to a fence named Old Joe. The Ghost then transports Scrooge to Bob’s house, discovering that Tiny Tim has died. Scrooge is escorted back to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out his own grave, revealing Ebenezer Scrooge was the man who died. On seeing this, Scrooge decides to change his ways. | Awakening in his bedroom on Christmas Day, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob’s family with a turkey dinner, and ventures out with Bean, the Great Gonzo, Rizzo, and the charity workers to spread happiness and joy around London. Scrooge goes to the Cratchits house, at first putting on a stern demmand, but reveals he intends on raising Bob’s salary and pay off his mortgage. The Great Gonzo narrates how Scrooge became a secondary father to Tiny Tim, who escaped death, and the film ends along with Scrooge, the Cratchits, and the neighbourhood celebrating Christmas Day.","m_cast":"Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge | Steven Mackintosh as Fred, Ebenezer Scrooge's nephew. | Meredith Braun as Belle, Scrooge's neglected fiancée. | Robin Weaver as Clara, Ebenezer Scrooge's niece-in-law and Fred's wife. | Jessica Fox as Ghost of Christmas Past (voice) | David Shaw Parker as Old Joe (voice) | Edward Sanders, Theo Sanders, Kristopher Milnes, Russell Martin, and Ray Coulthard as Young Scrooge | Anthony Hamblin as Boy #1 | Fergus Brazier as Boy #2 | Dave Goelz as: The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens Waldorf as Robert Marley Dr. Bunsen Honeydew Betina Crachit, the daughter of Bob and Emily Cratchit and twin sister of Belinda. | Steve Whitmire as: Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchit Rizzo the Rat as Himself Beaker Bean Bunny Belinda Crachit, the daughter of Bob and Emily Cratchit and twin sister of Betina. | Jerry Nelson as: Robin the Frog as Tiny Tim Cratchit Statler as Jacob Marley Ma Bear as Ma Fozziwig Ghost of Christmas Present (face and voice performance) | Frank Oz as: Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig Sam Eagle as the Schoolmaster Animal | David Rudman as: Peter Cratchit, the son of Bob and Emily Cratchit.

Following his death in 1990, talent agent Bill Haber approached his son Brian with the idea of filming an adaptation. Haber told Henson that \"Christmas Carol is the greatest story of all time, you should do that\" and later informed Henson that he sold the idea to ABC as a television movie.[4] Longtime Muppets writer Jerry Juhl was hired to write the script and decided to insert Charles Dickens as the stand-in narrator in order to remain faithful to the original prose of the written material.[5] Henson stated that Gonzo was chosen because he was the least likely choice to play Charles Dickens,[6] while Rizzo the Rat was added to inject some humor and serve as a Greek chorus.[7] Established Muppet characters were initially written to portray with various accounts stating Robin the Frog or Scooter was to be the Ghost of Christmas Past, Miss Piggy to be the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Gonzo (before he was written to portray Dickens) or Animal as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.[4][6] However, the idea was scrapped in favor of new Muppet characters that would better underline the ominous nature.[7] After the script was submitted for approval to ABC, the executives of Walt Disney Pictures offered to purchase the script for a feature film instead of a television movie.[6] | English actors David Hemmings, Ron Moody, and David Warner and comedian George Carlin were considered to portray Ebenezer Scrooge.[8] Henson later offered the role to Michael Caine, who agreed to the role on condition that \"I'm going to play this movie like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me.\"[4] Production took place at the Shepperton Studios, England and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.[9] During filming, in order to accommodate for the Muppets and the human actors to be in the shot, floors had to be removed and re-inserted, as well as Michael Caine having to walk across narrow planks between the Muppets and their performers.[10] Additionally, the buildings in the London street scenes were constructed by hand, but diminished in size in order to achieve the appearance that the streets were relatively longer. When the musical sequence \"It Feels Like Christmas\" ends with the crane shot, the short buildings became visibly seen in the background, in which Brian Henson explained on the DVD audio commentary that they were aware of the problem during shooting, but eventually decided that the closing shot was worth it as they believed not many people would notice the error.[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"A Christmas Carol  by Charles Dickens","m_directed_by":"Brian Henson","m_produced_by":"Brian Henson | Martin G.
