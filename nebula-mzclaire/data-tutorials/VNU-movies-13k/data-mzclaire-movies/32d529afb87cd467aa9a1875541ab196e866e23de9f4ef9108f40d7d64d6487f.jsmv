{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Johnny Talbot (Paddy Wallace), an American soldier serving in Afghanistan, is captured by terrorists and forced to witness the execution of his comrade, Ray (Parker Sawyers). | Kate Abbott (Milla Jovovich) is a Diplomatic Security Service agent working for the American Embassy in London, who began working in the government after most of her friends were killed in 9/11. While she is implementing new, more stringent visa applications for potential terrorist suspects, most of her team are killed while attending a restaurant for the birthday of their superior, Bill Talbot (Robert Forster), Johnny's father, with Kate only surviving because she left the restaurant to get a last-minute present for Bill. | An investigation into the attack reveals that the bomb has traces of chromium, leading one of Kate's fellow employees, Sam Parker (Dylan McDermott), to deduce that the perpetrator was the 'Watchmaker' (Pierce Brosnan), one of the world's most wanted killers, known for his precision work, who detonated a bomb with similar traces in Paris two years earlier. Nobody knows the Watchmaker's appearance, as he has had lots of plastic surgery over the years. Kate's subsequent attempts to find out the cause of the explosion reveal that Bill was being blackmailed to let certain visa applicants through after Johnny's capture, and the man behind the attack was indeed the Watchmaker. Her efforts uncover a plan to detonate another bomb at Times Square in New York City during the New Year's Eve celebrations. | As she carries out her own investigation, she is attacked by Bill, unintentionally killing him in self-defense. She is later classified, through witnesses and footage, as a suspect for the attacks by the others at the embassy and even the British TV Network (BTN), forcing her to sneak back into the embassy to create false passports for herself to follow the Watchmaker to New York, with support from Sam, her superior at the embassy, and her friend Sally (Frances de la Tour), the only two people who believe in her innocence. | Meanwhile, the Watchmaker tests a sphere bomb detonated with an explosive long-range gun round in Tower Hamlets, destroying a tower block. Later, he reveals that he is aware that his client's purpose for the Times Square attack is for making millions when the stock market reopens. He requests half the money, threatening to otherwise cancel the attack, before leaving for New York. The New Year's Eve ball is filled with explosive gas, like the tested sphere bomb, by the Watchmaker's friend, Dr Emil Balan (Roger Rees), who is involved in the attack to avenge his late wife. | In a final confrontation in Times Square, the Watchmaker kills Balan when he finishes his part of the job, and Kate, after a struggle, manages to throw the Watchmaker to his death on the stroke of midnight as he tries to trigger the bomb. Consequently, her hunch is vindicated and she clears her name. She receives a call from Sam, successfully recovered from recent injuries, congratulating her.","m_cast":"Milla Jovovich as Kate Abbott | Pierce Brosnan as Nash / \"The Watchmaker\" | Dylan McDermott as Sam Parker | Angela Bassett as Ambassador Maureen Crane | Robert Forster as Bill Talbot | James D'Arcy as Inspector Paul Anderson | Frances de la Tour as Sally | Antonia Thomas as Naomi Rosenbaum | Regé-Jean Page as Robert Purvell | Jing Lusi as Joyce Su | Paddy Wallace as Johnny Talbot | Parker Sawyers as Ray | Roger Rees as Dr. Emil Balan (in his final role)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The principal photography of the film Survivor began on January 20, 2014 in London.[2][3][5] Shooting took place in London for five weeks before production moved to Sofia, Bulgaria for three weeks.[6] Emma Thompson was cast and appeared in promotional material for the film, but she pulled out at the last minute.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James McTeigue","m_produced_by":"Charles Winkler | Irwin Winkler | Matthew O'Toole | Les Weldon","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Milla Jovovich | Pierce Brosnan | Dylan McDermott | Angela Bassett | Robert Forster","m_music_by":"Ilan Eshkeri","m_cinematography":"Danny Ruhlmann","m_edited_by":"Kate Baird","m_production_company":"Millennium Films","m_distributed_by":"Alchemy","m_release_dates":"May 29, 2015 (2015-05-29) (United States) | June 5, 2015 (2015-06-05) (United Kingdom) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 minutes","m_country":"United States United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$20 million","m_box_office":"$774,705[1] | Survivor is a 2015 British-American spy thriller film directed by James McTeigue[2] and written by Philip Shelby.
