{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"King Henry VIII's (Eric Bana) marriage to Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) does not produce a male heir to the throne; their only surviving daughter is Mary (Constance Stride). Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) and his brother in law Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance), plan to install Boleyn's older daughter Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman), as the king's mistress. They hope Anne will bear him a son. Anne's mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas), is disgusted by the plot. Anne eventually agrees to please her father and uncle. Anne's younger sister, Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson), marries William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), even though his family had asked for Anne's hand. | While visiting the Boleyn estate, Henry is injured in a hunting accident, indirectly caused by Anne, and, urged by her scheming uncle, is nursed by Mary. While in her care, Henry becomes smitten with her and invites her to court. Mary and her husband reluctantly agree, aware that the king has invited her because he desires her. Mary and Anne become ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine and Henry sends William Carey abroad on an assignment. Separated from her husband, Mary finds herself falling in love with Henry. Anne secretly marries the nobleman Henry Percy (Oliver Coleman), although he is betrothed to Lady Mary Talbot. Anne confides in her brother George Boleyn (Jim Sturgess), who is overjoyed and proceeds to tell Mary. Fearing Anne will ruin the Boleyn family by marrying such a prominent earl without the king's consent, Mary alerts her father and uncle. They confront Anne, annul the marriage, and exile her to France. | Mary becomes pregnant. Her family receives new grants and estates, their debts are paid, and Henry arranges George's marriage to Jane Parker. When Mary nearly suffers a miscarriage, she is confined to bed until her child is born. Norfolk recalls Anne to England to keep Henry's attention from wandering to another rival. In her belief that Mary exiled her to increase her own status, Anne successfully campaigns to win Henry over. When Mary gives birth to a son, Henry Carey, Thomas and Norfolk are overjoyed, but the celebration is short lived, as Anne whispered to Henry that the baby was born a bastard, which infuriates Norfolk. Henry then has Mary sent to the country at Anne's request. Shortly after, Mary is widowed. Anne encourages Henry to break from the Catholic Church when the Pope refuses to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine. Henry succumbs to Anne's demands, declares himself Supreme Head of the Church of England, and gets Cardinal Thomas Wolsey to annul the marriage. | Henry comes to Anne's rooms but she refuses to have sex with him, and, in a fit of rage, he rapes her. A pregnant Anne marries Henry to please her family and becomes Queen of England. Despite the birth of a healthy daughter, Elizabeth, Henry blames Anne for not producing a son, and begins courting Jane Seymour (Corinne Galloway) in secret. After Anne suffers the miscarriage of a son, she begs George to have sex with her to replace the child she lost, because if anyone found out about the miscarriage, she would be burned as a witch. George at first agrees, realizing that it is Anne's only hope, but they do not go through with it. However, George's neglected wife Jane witnesses enough of their encounter to become suspicious. She reports what she has seen and both Anne and George are arrested. The two are found guilty and sentenced to death for treason, adultery and incest. Distraught by the news of the execution of George, his mother disowns her husband and brother, vowing never to forgive them for what their greed has done to her children. | After Mary learns that she was late for George's execution, she returns to court to plead for Anne's life. Believing that Henry will spare her sister, she leaves to see Anne right before the scheduled execution. Anne asks Mary to take care of her daughter Elizabeth if anything should happen to her. Mary watches from the crowd as Anne makes her final speech, waiting for the execution to be cancelled as Henry promised. A letter from Henry is given to Mary, warning her not to come to his court further, and implicitly revealing his decision to execute Anne after all. Ten days after Anne's execution, Henry and Jane are married, Norfolk is imprisoned, and the next three generations of his family are executed for treason. Mary marries William Stafford (Eddie Redmayne) and they have two children, Anne and Edward. Mary takes an active role in raising Anne's daughter Elizabeth (Maisie Smith), who grows up to become Queen of England, and reigns for 44 years.","m_cast":"Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn. Portman was attracted to the role because it was a character that she \"hadn’t played before,\" and describes Anne as \"strong, yet she can be vulnerable and she’s ambitious and calculating and will step on people but also feels remorse for it.\" One month before filming began, Portman started taking daily classes to master the English accent under dialect coach Jill McCulloch, who also stayed on set throughout the filming.[2] | Scarlett Johansson as Mary Boleyn. Johansson expressed concern over the film being \"such a melodramatic tale.\" In response to critics being skeptical about the film featuring American actresses as major British characters, Johansson said, \"The three foreign actors will be using English accents ... I'll take away the eyebrows and the make-up and you won't notice I'm American.\"[3] | Eric Bana as Henry VIII of England. Bana commented that he was surprised upon being offered the role, and describes the character of Henry as \"a man who was somewhat juvenile and driven by passion and greed,\" and that he interpreted the character as \"this man who was involved in an incredibly intricate, complicated situation, largely through his own doing.\"[4] In preparation for the role, Bana relied mostly on the script to come up with his own version of the character, and he \"deliberately stayed away\" from other portrayals of Henry in films because he found it \"too confusing and restricting.\"[5] | Jim Sturgess as George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. Though the three siblings are all very tight-knit, George and Anne are closest. George supports and loves Anne for her rebellious and unconventional attitude. He is forced to marry Jane Parker. George is often viewed as the most vulnerable and probably the kindest of the siblings. | Kristin Scott Thomas as Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire and Ormond | Mark Rylance as Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond | David Morrissey as Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk | Benedict Cumberbatch as William Carey | Oliver Coleman as Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland | Ana Torrent as Catherine of Aragon | Eddie Redmayne as William Stafford | Juno Temple as Jane Parker | Iain Mitchell as Thomas Cromwell | Andrew Garfield as Francis Weston | Corinne Galloway as Jane Seymour | Constance Stride as young Mary Tudor | Maisie Smith as young Elizabeth Tudor | Alfie Allen as the King's Messenger","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Other Boleyn Girl  by Philippa Gregory","m_directed_by":"Justin Chadwick","m_produced_by":"Alison Owen","m_screenplay_by":"Peter Morgan","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Natalie Portman Scarlett Johansson Eric Bana Jim Sturgess Kristin Scott Thomas Mark Rylance David Morrissey","m_music_by":"Paul Cantelon","m_cinematography":"Kieran McGugan","m_edited_by":"Paul Knight Carol Littleton","m_production_company":"BBC Films Relativity Media","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures Focus Features","m_release_dates":"February 15, 2008 (2008-02-15) (Berlinale) | February 29, 2008 (2008-02-29) (United States) | March 7, 2008 (2008-03-07) (United Kingdom) |  | ","m_running_time":"115 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$35 million","m_box_office":"$77.7 million | The Other Boleyn Girl is a 2008 drama film directed by Justin Chadwick.
