The English version also features the voices of Victor Williams (TV's The King of Queens), Melinda Clarke (TV's The O.C.), Olivia d'Abo (TV's The Wonder Years), Pamela Adlon (TV's King of the Hill), and Kevin Michael Richardson of the Xbox game Halo 2, who also plays the voice of the Deus Ex Machina in The Matrix Revolutions. | The characters Neo, Trinity, and Kid also appear, with their voices provided by their original actors Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Clayton Watson.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Koji Morimoto | Shinichiro Watanabe | Mahiro Maeda | Peter Chung | Andy Jones | Yoshiaki Kawajiri | Takeshi Koike","m_produced_by":"Michael Arias | Spencer Lamm | Andy Wachowski | Larry Wachowski","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Julia Fletcher","m_music_by":"Don Davis | Machine Head | Photek","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Christopher S.
