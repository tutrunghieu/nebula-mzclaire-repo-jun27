{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) return home to District 12. President Snow visits Katniss at her home. The two make an agreement to not lie to one another, and Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired rebellions across the districts. He orders her to use the upcoming victory tour to convince him that her actions were out of genuine love for Peeta, not defiance against the Capitol, otherwise Katniss' loved ones will be killed. He shows her the clip where Gale kisses her as a warning that they are watching her. | As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's mentor, warns them that the \"show\" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and approved by Snow at his mansion in the Capitol. | Returning home, Katniss warns her friend Gale Hawthorne of Snow's threat to kill both their families. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12, and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Snow announces that the upcoming 75th Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, will feature tributes selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta's survival, and recruits Haymitch's help to do so. At the reaping, Effie Trinket draws Katniss and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place. | As they prepare, Haymitch reveals that all the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games and advises a reluctant Katniss to make allies. In the pre-Games interviews, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by President Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay. Peeta announces that he and Katniss have secretly married and are expecting a baby, which causes outrage, and the audience of Capitol citizens begins shouting for the Games to be stopped, to no avail. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is severely beaten by Peacekeepers, as punishment for the dress, and dragged away as Katniss watches helplessly. | In the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair and the elderly Mags, from District 4. The arena's outer force field shocks Peeta, stopping his heartbeat until Finnick revives him. The group flees from an emerging poisonous fog, and Mags sacrifices herself so as to avoid slowing them down. When vicious mandrills attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a tribute from District 6. The group escapes to a beach and meets District 3's Wiress and Beetee, and District 7's Johanna Mason. Wiress discovers the arena is designed like a clock with regular hazards each hour, but is killed soon afterward by Cashmere and Gloss, the brother and sister tributes from District 1, who are in turn killed by Johanna and Katniss, respectively. | Beetee suggests using one of the hazards, a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, and a coil of wire to electrocute the other remaining tributes. The group separates to prepare the trap, but once alone Johanna suddenly hits Katniss over the head, stunning her, and discreetly cuts the tracker from her arm. Katniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee with the wire from the tree attached to a makeshift spear. Unable to find Peeta, Katniss almost attacks Finnick, but Finnick reminds her to remember \"who the real enemy is\", as Haymitch had advised her prior to the Games. Katniss attaches the remaining wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arena's force field as the lightning hits, causing a power failure that takes down the dome's force field as well as the Capitol's surveillance. | Katniss awakens in an aircraft to find Haymitch, Beetee, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the new rebellion, and that half the tributes were aware of the plan to escape with Katniss, who symbolizes the growing rebellion. They were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna, as they still have their trackers on them. A distraught Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch. She later awakens to find Gale by her side, who reassures her that her family is safe but tells her that District 12 has been destroyed by the Capitol. The film ends with a close up of Katniss' eyes, as her expression changes from desperation and panic to one of steely resolve.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 253 professional critics, with a rating average of 7.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Smart, smoothly directed, and enriched with a deeper exploration of the franchise's thought-provoking themes, Catching Fire proves a thoroughly compelling second installment in the Hunger Games series.\"[71] It was the highest rated science fiction/fantasy movie of the year on the website.[72] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 76 (indicating \"generally favorable reviews\") based on 49 reviews.[73] According to polls conducted during the opening weekend by CinemaScore, the average grade audiences gave the film was an A, on an A+ to F scale.[74] | The Hollywood Reporter said that the film has received \"generally positive reviews\"[75] and CNN reported that reviews were \"overwhelmingly positive\" but noted that \"an overarching complaint\" was that it \"runs needlessly long ... and the screenplay and direction do occasionally fall short.\"[76] Entertainment Weekly said the consensus was that the sequel is \"a more-confident, more-polished movie that delves deeper into Panem's political conflict\". It also reported, \"Critics are impressed that [Lawrence] commits to Katniss just as much as she would a complex David O. Russell character.\"[77] | Writing for The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek praised Jennifer Lawrence's performance, writing that the actress is \"both on fire and in the process of becoming, and it’s magnificent to watch.\"[78] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 stars out of four and said, \"Pop-culture escapism can be thrilling when dished out by experts. Katniss is a character worth a handful of sequels. And Lawrence lights up the screen. You'll follow her anywhere.\" He also commended supporting actors Sam Claflin and Jena Malone.[79] Reviewing on Roger Ebert's website, Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today awarded the film three out of four stars, praising the acting of Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer and Jena Malone and referring to the challenges of the arena as \"visually intriguing.\" Wloszczyna writes: \"...the one truly fresh invention—and the one that matters most—is Katniss herself. With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter.\"[80] Ian Nathan of Empire gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and noted that it was even better than the first film. He praised director Lawrence for \"taking a more muscular approach\" and \"sensibly downplaying\" the love triangle, noting that \"neither [Peeta nor Gale], quite frankly, are fit to lay a pinky on [Katniss'] quiver\". One fault he did find was in Philip Seymour Hoffman's \"surprisingly ineffective performance\".[81] | A negative review came from Sophie Monks Kaufman of Little White Lies, who praised Lawrence's performance but criticised the \"dilution of the ingredients that made The Hunger Games so gripping.\" She also found fault with the \"lumbering\" plot, the \"hamminess\" of President Snow and Plutarch Heavensbee and the \"lacklustre and unconvincing script culled from a dramatically difficult book\".[82] David Denby of The New Yorker argued that the premise \"doesn't make a lot of sense\". He praised the \"impressive\" first act and Jennifer Lawrence, for \"project[ing] the kind of strength that Katharine Hepburn had when she was young.\" Denby found the second act \"attenuated and rhythmless\" and criticised the \"incoherent\" finale that \"will send the audience scurrying back to the book to find out what’s supposed to be going on\".[83] | The Hunger Games: Catching Fire earned $424,668,047 in North America and $440,343,699 in other countries for a worldwide total of $865,011,746.[2] Worldwide, it is the 47th highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing film of The Hunger Games series,[84] the highest-grossing film distributed by Lionsgate and the fifth highest-grossing 2013 film.[85] | Outside North America, it is the highest-grossing film of The Hunger Games series,[84] the highest-grossing film distributed by Lionsgate and the seventh highest-grossing 2013 film.[86] On its first weekend, it was only released in Brazil (November 15, 2013),[87] where it grossed $2.4 million on its opening day and $5.26 million for the weekend.[88][89] On the following Wednesday and Thursday, it opened in 42 more territories, bringing its total to $32 million in a week.[90] The film opened in 63 other territories and earned $138.4 million during the weekend ($146.6 million including its first week in Brazil).[91] Its three largest openings occurred in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($19.8 million), China ($13.0 million) and Germany ($12.9 million).
