{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Ottoman Empire, 1668. Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha concentrates his war efforts on the Cretan War, which inspires him to further subdue the Sultan's Christian subjects. One of the targets is Elindenya, a village located in a Rhodope valley where the Christians enjoy a de facto autonomy thanks to the local Muslim overlord Süleyman Agha's rule. A sipahi regiment is dispatched to the valley with the mission of converting the Christian population to Islam, by force if necessary. The extraordinary thing is that the regiment is led by Kara Ibrahim, a devshirme from Elindenya and although Süleyman Agha, feeling that his self-ordained rule is at stake, objects to forced conversions, Kara Ibrahim seems to be in favour of harsh measures against the locals, including his own family.","m_cast":"Yosif Sarchadzhiev as Kara Ibrahim | Rusi Chanev as The Priest, pop Aligorko | Ivan Krastev as Manol | Anya Pencheva as Sevda | Valter Toski as the Venetian | Vasil Mihaylov as Süleyman Aga | Kalina Stefanova as Elitza | Max Freeman as Momchil | Konstantin Kotsev as Karaibrahim's father dyado Galushko | Stoyko Peev as Goran | Bogomil Simeonov as Ismail Bey | Djoko Rosic as Kara Hasan | Velko Kanev as Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha | Stefka Berova as Gyulfie | Angel Ivanov as Mircho | Nikola Todev as Stoyko protsvet","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Ludmil Staikov","m_produced_by":"Hristo Nenov","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Yosif Sarchadzhiev Rusi Chanev","m_music_by":"Georgi Genkov","m_cinematography":"Radoslav Spasov","m_edited_by":"Violeta Toshkova","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Boyana Film","m_release_dates":"28 March 1988 (1988-03-28) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"288 minutes","m_country":"Bulgaria","m_language":"Bulgarian | Time of Violence (Bulgarian: Време на насилие, translit. Vreme na nasilie) is a 1988 Bulgarian film based on the novel Vreme razdelno (Време разделно, \"Time of Parting\") of Anton Donchev .
