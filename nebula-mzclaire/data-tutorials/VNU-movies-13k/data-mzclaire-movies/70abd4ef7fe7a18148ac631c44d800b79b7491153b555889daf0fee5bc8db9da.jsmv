Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying it's \"a beautiful, arty, very Malick-influenced evocation of Abraham Lincoln’s childhood.\"[5] Katie Hasty of HitFix praised the film by saying it is \"a lushly conceived, exhaustively realized debut feature that'd be pretty formidable stuff coming from a more practised filmmaker — and derided in some quarters as a self-impressed knock-off.\"[6] Rodrigo Perez in his Indiewire review said the movie focuses \"on mood, nature, divinity and celestial atmosphere\" rather than story.[7] | Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 39 percent, based on reviews from 41 critics, 16 of which were positive. According to the website, the film is \"Malick-inspired but not as inspired as Malick, The Better Angels muffles an interesting idea under ponderous execution.\"","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"A.
