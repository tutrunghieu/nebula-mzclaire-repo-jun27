{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"God lives in an apartment in Brussels, which he shares with his meek wife and his 10-year-old daughter Ea, to whom he is emotionally and physically abusive. God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer, which he strictly forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how He has been mistreating humans. This enrages God, who whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the pre-destined dates of death of every human in the world and releases it to the world. Everyone in Brussels receives a text message informing them when they are destined to die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes the apartment through a chute in the laundry room. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in Jesus' footsteps and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She decides to portray life of six selected apostles. | Before finding them, she gets a scribe, a homeless man: Victor. The first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second one is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park since he knew his date of death; eventually he starts a trip following a bird who asked him why would he stay there if he could go anywhere (with Ea translating for them.)The third apostle is a sexually-frustrated old man who is awkward around women. He is perpetually lovesick over a German girl he met once as a boy. On Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he coincidentally meets the girl of his youth. They form a relationship which they consummate. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death. When he learns that everyone's death is pre-destined, he purchases a rifle with plans to shoot pedestrians, believing that he will not really be at fault for their deaths. | Ea prods him to shoot a woman, who happens to be the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and forms a relationship, and learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She first does so with a male prostitute, then with a gorilla. The gorilla beats up her husband, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who discovers he has only days left to live. Ea encourages him to live the next days of his life as months and he dresses up as a princess. He chooses to dress and act like a girl. | God is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done. With everyone now aware of the time they have left, he can no longer torment humans through their fear of death. Worse still, with His computer locked, He is powerless. He leaves the apartment for the first time in His life through the chute in the laundry room. Because of His rude manners, he is assaulted by everyone He meets. He discovers to his horror that the chute to his apartment is gone and He is trapped in the outside world, powerless and alone. He is forced to take shelter in a church, and is eventually deported to Uzbekistan after being mistaken for an illegal migrant. | Ea and her apostles go to the seaside, where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which just so happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky, threatening everyone on the beach. At this moment, however, God's wife, who has grown accustomed to life without her husband while cleaning God's room she tries to accesses God's computer and it accepts her pass-code 18(no. of her baseball fantasy team members) and she cancels everyone's destined date of death and changes the natural order of things. The airplane regains altitude and everyone has a new lease on life. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament, which becomes a bestseller, lifting him out of poverty. God winds up in Uzbekistan, working in an appliance factory, where he vainly searches washing machines for a passage back to his apartment.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Brand New Testament received acclaim from film critics.
