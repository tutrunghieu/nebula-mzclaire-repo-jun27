{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bastian Balthazar Bux is a shy and friendless bibliophile 12-year-old, teased by bullies from school. On his way to school, he hides from the bullies in a bookstore, interrupting the grumpy bookseller, Mr. Coreander. Bastian asks about one of the books he sees, but Mr. Coreander advises against it. His curiosity piqued, Bastian seizes the book, leaving a note promising to return it, and hides in the school's attic to read. The book describes the world of Fantasia slowly being devoured by a force called \"The Nothing\". Fantasia's ruler, the Childlike Empress, has fallen ill, and Atreyu is tasked to discover the cure, believing that once the Empress is well, the Nothing will no longer be a threat. Atreyu is given a medallion named the AURYN that can guide and protect him in the quest. As Atreyu sets out, the Nothing summons Gmork, a wolf-like creature, to kill Atreyu. | Atreyu's quest directs him to the advisor Morla the Ancient One in the Swamps of Sadness. Though the AURYN protects Atreyu, his beloved horse Artax is lost to the swamp, and he continues alone. Later, Atreyu is surprised by the sudden appearance of Morla, a giant turtle. Bastian, reading, is also surprised and lets out a scream, which Atreyu and Morla appear to hear. Morla does not have the answers Atreyu seeks, but directs him to the Southern Oracle, ten thousand miles distant. Atreyu succumbs to exhaustion trying to escape the Swamps but is saved by the luckdragon Falkor (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer). Falkor takes him to the home of two gnomes that live near the entrance to the Oracle. The gnomes explain that Atreyu will face various trials before reaching the Oracle. Atreyu proceeds to enter the Oracle, and is perplexed when one second trial, a mirror that shows the viewer's true self, reveals a boy which Bastian recognizes as himself. Bastian throws the book aside, but after catching his breath, continues to read. Atreyu eventually meets the Oracle who tells him the only way to save the Princess is to find a human child to give her a new name, beyond the boundaries of Fantasia. | Atreyu and Falkor flee before the Nothing consumes the Oracle. In flight, Atreyu is knocked from Falkor's back into the Sea of Possibilities, losing the AURYN in the process. He wakes on the shore of an abandoned town, and finds a series of paintings depicting his quest. Gmork reveals himself, having being laying in wait and explains that Fantasia represents humanity's imagination, and that the Nothing represents adult apathy and cynicism against it. Atreyu fends off and kills Gmork as the Nothing begins to consume the town. Falkor, who had managed to locate the AURYN, rescues Atreyu in time. The two find themselves in a void with only small fragments of Fantasia remaining, and fear they have failed when they spot the Empress's Ivory Tower among the fragment. Inside, Atreyu apologizes for failing the Empress, but she asserts he has succeeded in bringing to her a human child who has been following his quest. As the Nothing begins to consume the Tower, the Empress pleas directly to Bastian to call out her new name. Bastian calls out the name he had selected: \"Moon Child\", and loses consciousness. | When he wakes, he finds himself in blackness with the Empress, with only a grain of sand the last bit of Fantasia remaining. The Empress tells Bastian that he has the power to bring Fantasia back with his imagination using the power of the AURYN. Bastian re-creates Fantasia, and as he flies on Falkor's back, he sees the land and its inhabitants restored, and that Atreyu has been reunited with Artax. When Falkor tells him he can wish for anything, Bastian then brings Falkor back to the real world to chase down the bullies from before. The film ends with the narration that Bastian had many more wishes and adventures, and adds: \"but that's another story\".","m_cast":"Barret Oliver as Bastian Balthazar Bux. | Noah Hathaway as Atreyu. | Tami Stronach as The Childlike Empress, to whom Bastian gives the new name of \"Moon Child\". | Patricia Hayes as Urgl, Engywook's wife and a healer. | Sydney Bromley as Engywook, a gnomish scientist. | Gerald McRaney as Mr. Bux, Bastian's widowed, workaholic father. | Moses Gunn as Cairon, a servant of the Empress. | Alan Oppenheimer as the voices of Falkor, Gmork, Rock Biter, and the Narrator. | Thomas Hill as Mr. Coreander. | Deep Roy as Teeny Weeny, a messenger riding on a racing snail. | Tilo Prückner as Nighthob, a messenger riding a narcoleptic bat. | Darryl Cooksey, Drum Garrett, and Nicholas Gilbert as Ethan, Todd, and Lucas, who torment Bastian.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The adaptation only covered the first half of the book. The majority of the film was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich, except for the street scenes and the school interior in the real world, which were shot in Vancouver, BC, Canada,[6] and the beach where Atreyu falls, which was filmed at Monsul Beach in Almería (Spain). It was Germany's highest budgeted film at the time. | The film score of The NeverEnding Story was composed by Klaus Doldinger of the German jazz group Passport. The theme song of the North American release of the film was composed by Giorgio Moroder with lyrics by Keith Forsey, and performed by Limahl (lead singer of Kajagoogoo) and Beth Anderson. It was released as a single in 1984, it peaked at No. 4 on the UK singles chart, No. 6 on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song has been covered by The Birthday Massacre, Creamy, Dragonland, Kenji Haga, and New Found Glory. More recent covers were done by Norwegian synthpop group Echo Image on their 2001 maxi-single Skulk and by German techno group Scooter on their 2007 album Jumping All Over the World. This Limahl song, along with other \"techno-pop\" treatments to the soundtrack, is not present in the German version of the film, which features Doldinger's orchestral score exclusively. | In 1994, Italian house music group Club House released the song Nowhere Land (featuring Carl), which combines the melody of the tune Bastian's Happy Flight with original lyrics. | An official soundtrack album was released featuring Doldinger's score and Moroder's theme tune (Moroder also rescored several scenes for the version released outside Germany).[7] The track listing (Doldinger is responsible for everything from track 6 onwards) is as follows: | In Germany, an album featuring Doldinger's score was released.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Neverending Story  by Michael Ende","m_directed_by":"Wolfgang Petersen","m_produced_by":"Bernd Eichinger | Dieter Geissler","m_screenplay_by":"Wolfgang Petersen | Herman Weigel","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Alan Oppenheimer","m_music_by":"Klaus Doldinger | Giorgio Moroder","m_cinematography":"Jost Vacano","m_edited_by":"Jane Seitz","m_production_company":"Producers Sales Organization","m_distributed_by":"West Germany: | Neue Constantin Film | United States: | Warner Bros.

The film was produced by Bernd Eichinger and Dieter Giessler and directed and co-written by Wolfgang Petersen (his first English-language film) and starred Barret Oliver, Noah Hathaway, Tami Stronach, Moses Gunn, Thomas Hill; and Alan Oppenheimer as the voices of both Falkor and Gmork. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film produced outside the United States or the Soviet Union. The film was later followed by two sequels.[2] | Ende felt that this adaptation's content deviated so far from the spirit of his book that he requested that production either be halted or the film's title be changed; when the producers did neither, he sued them and subsequently lost the case.[3] Ende called the film a \"gigantic melodrama of kitch, commerce, plush and plastic\".[4] The film only adapts the first half of the book, and consequently does not convey the message of the title as it was portrayed in the novel. The second half of the book would subsequently be used as the rough basis for the second film, The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter. The third film, The NeverEnding Story III: Escape from Fantasia, features a completely original plot. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE NEVER ENDING STORY (U)\".
