Rotten Tomatoes sampled 49 reviewers and judged 51% of the reviews to be positive, with an average score of 5.6.[14] The site described the film as \"a little deeper and more thoughtful than most police dramas – but not quite enough to surmount its thinly written characters and numbing violence\".[14] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 49 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews from 16 critics.[15] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated it 2/5 stars and called it an ambitious but predictable film that \"runs out of steam\" by the end.[16] Emma Dibdin of Total Film rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \"There’s an emotional vacuum at its centre but Welcome To The Punch is an adrenalin shot to the heart of the Brit-crime genre.\"[17] Dan Jolin of Empire rated it 4/5 stars and called it \"a confident, ambitious and action-rich Brit thriller, albeit one whose characters and clarity suffer from the frantic intensity of its pacing.\"[18] Guy Lodge of Variety described it as \"a proficient but personality-free policer that demands little of either its audience or its enviable best-of-British cast\".[19] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"But despite its fast pacing and well-staged action set-pieces, the film fails to make much of an impression.\"[20] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it \"derivative, dumb fun\".[21] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that it is an \"enjoyable absurdity\" that is unintentionally funny yet still recommended.[22]","m_production":"The film was produced by Ben Pugh and Rory Aitken of Between the Eyes, who also produced Eran Creevy's debut feature SHIFTY.
