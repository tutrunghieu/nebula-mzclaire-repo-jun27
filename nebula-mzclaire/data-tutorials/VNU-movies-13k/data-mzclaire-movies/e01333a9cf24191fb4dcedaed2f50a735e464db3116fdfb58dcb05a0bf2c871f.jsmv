{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"When young Steven's mother Selma is diagnosed with ovarian cancer and becomes increasingly ill, his eccentric and emotionally distant inventor father Sid — despite deep reservations — allows him to live with his dysfunctional uncles, pack rat Arthur and delusional paranoid Danny, in their cluttered apartment in the rundown King Edward Hotel. The two, who live in a setting worthy of the Collyer brothers, rechristen the boy with the more colorful name Franz and help him cope with his emotions by teaching him to value his own uniqueness. Learning from the odd pair that even though hope and science may fail us, art always survives, Franz secretly begins to create a memorial to his mother before she dies, filling a box with personal mementos — a tube of lipstick, an empty Chanel bottle, a cigarette lighter, and the like.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film shifted the original story's setting of New York to Southern California, and the four uncles from the memoir were condensed into two.[1] | Keaton's previous directing credits were the 1987 documentary Heaven and the 1991 television movie Wildflower. | The film debuted at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival in May.[2] Prior to its release, it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Boston Film Festival, both held in September 1995.[3] | During its widest release in the US, the film played at only 576 theaters.
