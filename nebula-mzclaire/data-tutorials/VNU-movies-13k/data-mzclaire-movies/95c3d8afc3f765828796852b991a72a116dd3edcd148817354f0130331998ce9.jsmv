{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film revolves around former FBI secretary Erin Grant, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela (Rumer Willis) to her ex-husband Darrell, who is a criminal and cost Erin her job. To afford an appeal to get her daughter back, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Erin. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the congressman to settle the custody battle and help her get Angela back. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care. | Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer (Armand Assante) begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, gets her job in the FBI back, and retires from stripping, and Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.","m_cast":"Demi Moore as Erin Grant | Armand Assante as Lt.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times complimented some of the characters, but ultimately concluded the film failed because \"all of the characters are hilarious except for Demi Moore's.\" He felt the drama surrounding the main character \"throws a wetblanket over the rest of the party.\" Ebert also found the nudity not too sexy.[13] Leonard Maltin was harsher, writing in his book that the film was too depressing, and \"Not funny enough, or dramatic enough, or sexy enough, or bad enough, to qualify as entertainment in any category.\"[15] Barbara Cramer concurred with Ebert that Moore's character was written too dramatically, compared to other characters. She said the film was predictable and would appeal mostly to \"post-pubescent schoolboys or closet voyeurs.\" However, Cramer also cited Reynolds' \"his best role in years,\" and that Rhames was \"worth the price of admission.\"[9] Brian D. Johnson of Maclean's, who thought Moore's acting was terrible, predicted that despite Moore's financial success, her career depended on the success of this film and the film was \"tacky, pretentious-and boring.\" This critic described Striptease as displaying Moore's vanity.[16] Dave Ansen of Newsweek, sharing Ebert's view on Moore's character, also claimed Striptease failed as a drama because it had no mystery, revealing the identity of its villains early. Moreover, the \"damsel-in-distress angle generates zero tension.\"[17] Daniel P. Franklin, in his book Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States went so far as to call Striptease \"the worst film ever made\" [18] and stated \"The film pays homage to Moore's surgical breast enhancement\".[18] Nathan Rabin, reviewing the film for his series \"My Year of Flops\", described the film thus: \" Moore's dour lead performance sabotages the film from the get-go. It's as if director Andrew Bergman told Moore she was acting in a serious drama about a struggling single mother...and then told everyone else in the cast that they were making a zany crime comedy filled with kooky characters, sleazy hustlers, dumbass opportunists, and outsized caricatures.\" [19] Striptease currently holds a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews. | The film received seven Golden Raspberry nominations and won six, namely for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actress, Worst Original Song (\"(Pussy Pussy Pussy) Whose Kitty Cat Are You?\"), and Worst Screen Couple. The only category the film lost was Worst Supporting Actor for Burt Reynolds, which went to Marlon Brando for The Island of Dr. Moreau. In winning the Worst Picture Razzie, Striptease defeated The Island of Dr. Moreau, Barb Wire, The Stupids, and Ed. Moore won for Worst Actress while she and Reynolds shared for Worst Screen Couple. | Striptease made $12,322,069 in its first weekend, falling behind The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy, Eraser starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, in which Moore voiced one of the main characters.[20] Ultimately, Striptease made $33,109,743 in the United States, and domestically it was the 47th highest grossing film of 1996. It made $113,309,743 internationally,[2] having grossed £2,104,480 in the UK and ¥102,419,500 in Japan.[21] | The film's distribution rights were transferred to Warner Bros. in 1999. | In 1997, Striptease made news again when it was shown in a fourth-grade class in Chicago, Illinois. The teacher claimed the students chose the film, but he drew criticism since the film was risqué. (The violent 1996 film Scream was shown in the same school on the same day, causing further controversy.)[22] In 2000 in Ireland, some viewers criticized the Radio Telefís Éireann for running Striptease. These viewers questioned the film's appropriateness and some considered it demeaning to women. However, the station felt it was not pornography and it was aired at night.[23] | In 2003, Radioactive Films used a scene from Striptease featuring Moore nude in a video called Hollywood's Hottest. This raised a dispute as to whether use of the scene qualified as fair use. A lawsuit was launched as a consequence.[24]","m_production":"Castle Rock Entertainment produced Striptease. The film is based on the novel Strip Tease by Floridian crime writer Carl Hiaasen. It was published in 1993 and was a bestseller. The screenplay itself was written by Andrew Bergman, who also directed. According to one critic, the novel's plot is \"quite faithfully followed\" by the screenplay, but in bringing the complicated story to the screen, \"Bergman forgets to explain persuasively what a nice girl like Erin — smart, spunky and a former FBI employee — is doing in a dump called the Eager Beaver.\"[4] | Concerns that the ending of the film was not comical enough resulted in rewrites and reshoots, causing a one-month delay.[5] Part of these concerns owed to test screenings, where audiences objected to a scene where Dilbeck becomes violent. Later test screenings also turned up less than favorable reactions.[6] | Moore played the main female character, Erin Grant. For the film, she was paid $12.5 million, which was at the time a record for an actress. To prepare for her role, Moore visited strip clubs in New York City, California, and Florida, and she met with strippers. Moore really did dance topless in the part,[7] and this was the sixth time she showed her breasts on film.[6] She also read the novel, exercised, and practiced yoga.[6] Moore was cast before other important parts were cast, creating some interest in the project.[8] In the first attempt at filming Moore stripping, two hundred actors were used to portray the audience. Although their salaries were small, many accepted the role to see Moore nude. After waiting for a while, when Moore finally appeared and started dancing the crowd turned so loud and wild that the shooting had to temporarily cease. As Moore said, \"After my experience, I felt very confident.\"[6] | The cast included some notable real-world strippers such as Pandora Peaks. Rhames plays a bouncer named Shad. The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone \"at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity.\"[8] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew in his early life, through his father, a police chief.[9] Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career.[10] Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, \"she [Willis] wanted it so badly\" that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for a scene in which Angela sees Erin performing. However, Moore said that this was acceptable, as \"We don't shame the body, we encourage the body as something beautiful and natural, and my children bathe with me, and I walk around naked.\"[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Strip Tease  by Carl Hiaasen","m_directed_by":"Andrew Bergman","m_produced_by":"Andrew Bergman | Mike Lobell","m_screenplay_by":"Andrew Bergman","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Demi Moore | Armand Assante | Ving Rhames | Robert Patrick | Burt Reynolds","m_music_by":"Howard Shore","m_cinematography":"Stephen Goldblatt","m_edited_by":"Anne V.
