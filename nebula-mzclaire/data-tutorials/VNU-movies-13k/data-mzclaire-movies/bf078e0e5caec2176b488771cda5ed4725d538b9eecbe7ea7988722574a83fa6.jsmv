{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow named Judy Hopps fulfills her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit police officer in Zootopia, an urban utopia. | Despite being the police academy valedictorian, Judy is relegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential. On her first day, she is hustled by Nick Wilde and Finnick, a con artist duo. The next day, Judy abandons parking duty and arrests Duke Weaselton, a thief who stole plant bulbs. Bogo reprimands her, but a female otter then enters, pleading for someone to find her missing husband, Emmitt Otterton, part of a string of disappearances of predator individuals. Judy volunteers, causing Bogo to fire her, but he instead reluctantly gives her two days to find Otterton after Assistant Mayor Bellwether, a sheep, praises the assignment, under the condition that Judy resign if she fails. | Judy discovers that Nick was the last one to see Otterton, so she blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals that Otterton, his florist, went \"savage\" – reverted to a feral state – and attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. At his home, Manchas mentions that Otterton had been yelling about \"night howlers.\" Suddenly, Manchas himself goes savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help. But when Bogo and other police arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick defends Judy, pointing out that she still has ten hours to solve the case. As they leave, Nick opens up to Judy, revealing he was bullied as a child for being a fox and subsequently became a con artist, resolving to live out the stereotype of a fox. | Bellwether gives Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic camera system and they discover Manchas was captured by wolves, which Judy surmises are the \"night howlers\". They locate Otterton and the other missing predators in a lab where Mayor Lionheart, a lion, has been keeping them hidden and trying to determine the cause of their strange behavior. Lionheart is arrested, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor. Judy, praised for cracking the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD and become her partner, which he happily considers. However, Judy then speaks at a press conference and angers Nick by suggesting a biological cause for the recent predator behavior. Nick refuses her offer and angrily leaves, and a guilt-ridden Judy resigns amid a wave of fear and protests against predators, a minority group. | Back in Bunnyburrow, Judy learns from her parents and reformed childhood bully, fox Gideon Grey, that \"night howlers\" are toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on animals. Judy returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick. They find Weaselton and discover that the bulbs he was stealing were night howlers intended for a ram named Doug, who has weaponized a night howler serum into a dart gun, which he has been using to turn predators savage. Before they can bring the evidence to the ZPD, Bellwether intercepts them and steals it, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Judy and Nick are trapped after Nick refuses to abandon Judy when she is injured. Bellwether calls the police, intending to use the serum to make Nick kill Judy, but Nick had disarmed the weapon by replacing the serum pellets with blueberries, and Judy has recorded Bellwether's confession as the police arrive. Lionheart denies any knowledge of Bellwether's plot, but asserts that he imprisoned the savage predators for the \"right reasons.\" | Judy rejoins the ZPD, and Nick joins to become her partner (becoming the first fox police officer). The savage predators are cured by an antidote. During the film's closing credits, popstar Gazelle holds a concert to celebrate, with Bellwether and her accomplices angrily watching in prison.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"As of July 4, 2016[update], Zootopia has grossed $340,7 million in North America and $676.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $1.019 billion against a budget of $150 million.[5][6] It became the second surprising hit of the year, following Deadpool.[65] On March 18, 2016, the film reached the $500 million mark, becoming the third consecutive Walt Disney animated film to reach the milestone after Frozen (2013) and Big Hero 6 (2014).[66][67] On April 5, it became the first film of 2016 to gross over $800 million in ticket sales,[68] and on April 24, became the first ever film of 2016 to cross $900 million.[69] On June 5, 2016 the film crossed the $1 billion mark, becoming the second film of 2016 to do so (after Captain America: Civil War), the fourth animated film, the eleventh Disney film (third Disney animated film) and the twenty-sixth film overall to break the milestone.[70] | Worldwide, it is currently the second highest-grossing film of 2016 behind Captain America: Civil War, the highest-grossing animated film of 2016,[71] the second highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film of all-time in its original release (after Frozen) and the second highest overall (also Frozen),[68] the second highest-grossing original film (behind Avatar),[65] the fourth highest-grossing animated film of all-time,[65] and the twenty-fifth highest-grossing film of all time. | In the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking suggested the film would open to $60–70 million from 3,827 theaters in its opening weekend.[72][73] It played in 3,100 3D theaters, 365 IMAX theaters and 325 premium large formats screens.[72] It earned $1.7 million from Thursday previews, a record for a non-Pixar Disney animated film,[74] for an animated film opening outside of summer,[75] and seventh biggest all-time for an animated film.[76] Buoyed by good word of mouth, it earned $19.5 million on its opening day, also a record for a non-Pixar Disney animated film (breaking Frozen's record),[74] and the second biggest for a March animated film (behind Ice Age: The Meltdown).[77] In its opening weekend, it scored a better than expected $75.1 million, which was the biggest non-Pixar Disney animated opening (breaking Big Hero 6's record), the biggest opening weekend among Walt Disney Animation Studios films (breaking Frozen's record), the biggest March animated opening (breaking Dr. Seuss' The Lorax record), the fourth biggest March opening and the eighth biggest animated opening of all time.[78][79][80] Furthermore, its opening weekend is also the third biggest for an original film, behind only Inside Out and Avatar.[81] It also performed exceptionally well in IMAX, where the film brought in $5.2 million from 366 screens, the second best animated IMAX opening behind only Toy Story 3's $8.4 million.[79] | In its second weekend, it fell gradually by 31.6% to $51.3 million and recorded one of the best holds for an animated film, more or less on par with Wreck-It Ralph's second weekend drop of 32.7%, but a bigger drop than The Lego Movie's 27%.[82] It continued to top the box office for the third weekend, earning $37.2 million, falling by 28% from its previous weekend while passing the $200 million mark.[83] This made it the second-biggest third weekend for a film that did not open at over $100 million, behind the $68 million third weekend of Avatar and ahead of Skyfall's $35 million.[84] The film was overtaken by the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in its fourth weekend, despite only a marginal decline.[85] It spent a total of thirteen consecutive weeks in the top ten, putting it behind Avatar (14 weeks) and Frozen (16 weeks) among any film over the last decade.[65] | Internationally, Zootopia received a scattered release as Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures decided to take advantage of school holidays in various markets. It began opening in a very limited number of international markets in the weekend ending February 14, earning $4.5 million from 3 markets.[86] It expanded to 22 markets in its second weekend, into 36% of its total international markets, and added $31.2 million.[87] It added another $33 million in its third weekend with no new markets.[88] In its fourth weekend, it expanded to 45 countries and grossed $64.7 million, coming in second place at the international box office, behind the Chinese film Ip Man 3.[89] $3.3 million came from IMAX showings.[89] It finally topped the box office in its fifth weekend after a strong second weekend gross in China. It added $89.3 million from 45 countries, an increase of 25% from its previous weekend.[90] It remained in first place for the second time in its sixth weekend,[91] before Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice took the top spot.[92] It passed the $500 million mark in its eighth weekend.[93] | In its opening weekend – which varied between markets – the film grossed $3.1 million in Spain and an additional $1.7 million in Belgium and Denmark. In Belgium, it had the biggest ever animated opening for a Disney or Pixar movie.[86] It broke opening records for a non-Pixar Disney animated film in China ($23.6 million), France ($8.7 million), Russia ($7.9 million), Germany ($6.8 million), Hong Kong ($1.9 million), Poland ($1.2 million), and India.[87][89][92][94] It opened in the United Kingdom and Ireland with $7.3 million, Mexico with $4.6 million, Australia with $3.6 million, Brazil with $2.6 million, and in Italy, opened on a non-holiday weekend to $3.3 million.[87][91][92] The film had No. 1 openings in Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, and South Africa.[89] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, with significant competition from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the animated family film Kung Fu Panda 3, the film had a £5.31 million ($7.6 million) opening weekend from 579 theaters, including £1.74 million ($2.5 million) worth of previews, debuting in second place behind Dawn of Justice and falling just short of Walt Disney Animation Studios' best opening in the U.K.[95][96] It fell just 24% in its second weekend, despite facing competition from holdover Dawn of Justice and newcomer Eddie the Eagle, earning £2.7 million ($3.8 million) and falling in third place behind the two aforementioned films.[97] | Zootopia's largest markets outside of North America are China ($236.1 million), followed by Japan ($48.4 million), France ($36.0 million), Russia and the CIS ($34.4 million), the United Kingdom ($33.6 million), Germany ($32.2 million), and South Korea ($31.1 million).[98][99][100] In China, it is the highest-grossing Disney film in local currency (¥1.530 billion), surpassing Avengers: Age of Ultron (¥1.464 billion), as well as the 7th highest grossing film of all time.[101][102] In Russia, it is the second highest grossing film of all time in local currency (₽2.3 billion), behind only Avatar (₽3.6 billion).[103] It topped the Russian and German box office for three weekends,[104][105] and the Chinese and Korean box office for two weekends.[106][107] | In China, where it was locally known as Crazy Animal City (疯狂动物城)[51] the film exceeded expectations[108] and was considered Hollywood's biggest breakout hit in China since 2015's Jurassic World made $229 million.[109] It had an opening day of $3.4 million on its way to $23.8 million for its three-day opening weekend, debuting in second place and scoring the biggest non-sequel animated opening, as well as the second biggest three-day opening and IMAX opening for an animated film, behind Kung Fu Panda 3.[51][89] In its ninth day of release (a Saturday), it recorded the biggest single day gross ever for an animated film, with $25 million (compared to $10.6 million on its first Saturday), and passed the lifetime total of Big Hero 6 to become the highest-grossing Disney animated film in China.[110][111] In its second weekend, it grossed $60 million,[112] an enormous increase of 139% from its previous weekend, and crossed the $100 million mark to become the third animated film in China to do so, after Kung Fu Panda 3 and Monkey King: Hero Is Back. This also marked the single best weekend for an animated film.[90] In mid-March, the combined total of Kung Fu Panda 3 and Zootopia alone broke 2014's record of $286 million in box office grosses for American animated features in China.[113] In its third weekend, it grossed $40 million for a total of $175 million, making it the highest grossing animated film of all time in China.[114] On March 27, its seventeenth day of release, it passed the $200 million mark, becoming the first animated film, the second Disney film, and the sixth Hollywood film overall to pass that milestone.[92] Zootopia's final gross is 9.92 times more than its opening weekend, behind only Monkey King: Hero Is Back (9.97 times more).[115] Its final gross is also 69 times more than its opening day gross, a record previously held by Goodbye Mr. Loser with 61.9 times more. The previous record for animated films was held by Monkey King: Hero Is Back with 53.1 times more.[116] | It opened in Japan on April 23[117] and earned $4 million in its opening weekend, debuting at second place in the box office, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare,[118][119] and had the third-biggest Walt Disney Animation debut in that market, behind Frozen and Big Hero 6.[69] Deadline.com pointed out that the average opening number might have been due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, which could have affected moviegoers.[69] In a rare achievement, it topped the box office in its third weekend after two weeks at No. 2.[120] In the following two weekends, it continued to increase its ticket sales,[121] and topped the box office there for four consecutive weekends.[122][123] After four straight wins, it was finally overtaken by the R-rated superhero film Deadpool.[124] It was the No. 1 western/Hollywood film for eight consecutive weekends.[125] The Hollywood Reporter cited that strong word of mouth, audiences watching both the English and Japanese versions, and 3D and 4DX screenings, as well as a popular Japanese version of the \"Try Everything\" song by Dream Ami, all helped boost Zootopia's performance.[122] Its strong run in the market aided the film to propel past the $1 billion mark worldwide.[126] It remained in top three for ten consecutive weekends and has grossed a total of $67 million there.[127][128] | Zootopia received critical acclaim.[129][130] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 98%, based on 213 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus statement reads, \"The brilliantly well-rounded Zootopia offers a thoughtful, inclusive message that's as rich and timely as its sumptuously state-of-the-art animation – all while remaining fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained.\"[131] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 39 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[132] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[133] | Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times considered the movie \"funny, smart, [and] thought-provoking.\"[134] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers wrote that Zootopia \"may be the most subversive movie of\" 2016, praising its timely message about the harm of prejudice in the face of the prevailing xenophobic political rhetoric at the time of the film's release, and the film's humor.[11] Peter Debruge at Variety opined that Zootopia \"plays directly to the studio's strengths.\"[135] IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave the film a 9.0 out of 10 'Amazing' score, saying \"Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney, at its best, can mix its past and present together in a very cool, compelling way. It takes the classic animation trope of animals walking, talking and acting like humans, but gives it a modern spin both in terms of its humor and animation style ... and also in its themes, which are meaningful and fascinatingly topical.\"[136] | Writing in British Sunday newspaper The Observer, reviewer Mark Kermode found the film to be a \"very funny, and very likable holiday treat\". He added, \"The ensuing drama is nominally a tale of predators succumbing to their animal instincts while frightened prey fear their neighbours. In fact, it's a delightfully well-orchestrated parable about trust and tolerance verses panic and prejudice. An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty. If that all sounds overly on-message, then fear not – the jokes are funny, the characters engaging, and the animation packed with delicious visual detail\", before concluding, \"[…] this is proper family fun with genuine cross-generational appeal. Hooray!\"[137] | In the UK daily newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin noted, \"The lion doesn't just lie down with the lamb, they run for City Hall on a joint ticket. It's the diversity dream come true. Or is it? […] Think Busytown by way of Chinatown. It's almost certain to be the most existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year.\" Collin added, \"Like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs., albeit considerably cuter, Judy and Nick make a hilariously strained but effective double act – not least thanks to Goodwin and Bateman's tremendous vocal work, which trips along with the effortless swing and snap of great bebop.\" He concluded, \"You could read a blunt racial equivalence into this – and there are moments in which the film openly invites us to do so. ('Go back to the forest, predator!' a sheep shouts at a cheetah. 'I'm from the savannah,' comes the weary reply.) But the allegory is far from rigid, and one of the film's great strengths is the trust it puts in its young audience to decode its complex, nuanced message about the value of difference. 'Turns out real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker,' Judy sighs after a few days on the beat. 'Real life is messy'. Yes it is – and all the more funny, chaotic and beautiful because of it. So too, in the best possible way, is this film.\"[138] | Also in The Daily Telegraph, Rosa Prince singled out the film's lead character, Judy Hopps, as a welcome change for Disney animated feature film heroines, such as the Disney Princess franchise. She found that unlike those characters' focus on romance or family loyalty, Hopps' focus is on her dream career as a police officer and serving her city. Prince noted: \"Zootropolis has a few more women than most Disney movies - around a third of the cast. But it is Judy who breaks the mould; a character who has no interest in being saved by Prince Charming, she’s too busy saving everyone else. As Ginnifer Goodwin, the actress who voices Judy and has two sons, has said: 'If I had little girls, I would kill for Judy Hopps to be their role model. And I would kill for Judy to be my boys' role model, too.' […] So perhaps it is time to get our daughters a Judy Hopps cop costume and tell them to put away their princess dress. If they protest, we can remind them of the advice given by Judy's boss, Chief Bogo: 'Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and your insipid dreams magically come true. So Let It Go.'\".[139]","m_production":"The project was first announced in August 2013 at that year’s D23 Expo.[33] The film, scripted by Jared Bush, was scheduled for a March 2016 release.[33][34] Prior to the official announcement, in May 2013, information about Jason Bateman's casting was leaked to the press, although little else about the film was known at the time.[14] The idea originated with Howard wanting to do a film similar to Disney’s Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles.[33] With this in mind, the city was envisioned as if animals designed it rather than humans.[33] According to Howard, Zootopia would be different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. The concept, where animals live in a modern world designed by animals, was well received by chief creative officer and executive producer John Lasseter, who lifted Howard \"in the air like a baby Simba\" when he proposed the idea for the film.[35] | Research for the film took place in Disney's Animal Kingdom, as well as in Kenya and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where animators spent eight months studying various animals' walk cycles as well as fur color.[36][37] 800,000 forms of mammals were created for and featured in the film.[37] To make the characters' fur even more realistic, they also went to a natural history museum to closely observe the appearance of fur with a microscope under a variety of lighting.[37] The filmmakers drew inspiration for Zootopia's urban design from major cities including New York City, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Brasília.[38] To develop a city that could actually be inhabited by talking mammals ranging in size from two inches (5 cm) to 27 feet (8.23 m) and from drastically different climates, the filmmakers consulted Americans with Disabilities Act specialists and HVAC system designers.[39] In March 2015, it was revealed that Rich Moore (Wreck-It Ralph) had been added as a director of the film, in addition to Jared Bush (Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero) as co-director.[40] | Disney's most recent work on animating fur was for the titular character of the 2008 film Bolt, but the software they had used at the time was not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia.[37] Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software iGroom, which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal.[37] The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" underlayer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before.[37] This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur.[37] Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on Elsa's head in Frozen.[37] | Zootopia was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on Big Hero 6.[37] A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur.[37] Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of Wreck-It Ralph, was used to make the fur more consistent, intact and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character.[37] The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in Frozen, was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.[37] | Zootopia was originally conceived of as an international spy film centered on a character named \"Jack Savage\" who would be somewhat like James Bond.[41] Over time, with the help of the Disney Story Trust (the studio's top creative personnel who meet regularly to discuss all projects in development), the film evolved into a police procedural in which Wilde was the lead role and Hopps was essentially his sidekick.[41][42] For a while, \"the filmmakers were very committed\" to that version of the story,[41] but then in November 2014, the filmmakers realized the film's plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Judy as opposed to Nick.[42] The change in perspective caused several characters to be dropped, notably two characters known as \"The Gerbil Jerks\" who were described as \"trust-fund gerbils that had nothing better to do than harass Nick,” [43] | On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Lieutenant Judy Hopps.[13] The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\". Bateman described his character as \"a crafty, sarcastic schemer\", remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: \"'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they just looked at me like I was an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk'\".[44] | Commenting on the casting of Goodwin, Moore said that she brought \"very centered sweetness, tremendous heart and a great sense of humor\"; he described Judy as \"a little Pollyanna mixed with Furiosa\". Goodwin stated about her character: \"People mistake kindness for naivete or stupidity, and she is a good girl through and through. But she's not a dumb bunny\".[44] In July 2015, Alan Tudyk announced that he would join the cast;[45] his character's name was revealed to be Duke Weaselton.[15] | The film's score is composed by Michael Giacchino.[2] It marks his first feature-length project for Walt Disney Animation Studios,[2] as he previously scored the Goofy short How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, the two Prep & Landing specials and short film, and the short film The Ballad of Nessie. In addition to her voice role of Gazelle, pop star Shakira also contributed an original song to the film titled \"Try Everything\", which was written by Sia and Stargate.[17][46] The film's score was recorded by an 80-piece orchestra in November 2015, with Tim Simonec conducting.[47] | All music composed by Michael Giacchino (except \"Try Everything\").","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Byron Howard | Rich Moore","m_produced_by":"Clark Spencer","m_screenplay_by":"Jared Bush | Phil Johnston[1]","m_story_by":"Byron Howard | Rich Moore | Jared Bush | Josie Trinidad | Jim Reardon | Phil Johnston | Jennifer Lee","m_starring":"Ginnifer Goodwin | Jason Bateman | Idris Elba | Jenny Slate | Nate Torrence | Bonnie Hunt | Don Lake | Tommy Chong | J.
