{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Pintoo (Arjun Kapoor) is a young Kabbadi player who goes to factionism-hit Mathura to take part in practice. There, in a twist of fate, he saves Radhika (Sonakshi Sinha) from Gajendar Singh (Manoj Bajpayee), a dangerous faction leader, who is in love with Radhika and wants to marry her against her wishes. Pintoo tries to comfort her because Gajendar Singh killed her brother. When he saves Radhika, he humiliates Gajendar into taking his pants off. Ganjendar refuses to put them back on until someone finds Radhika and brings her back. Pintoo helps Radhika escape and takes her to his house in Agra, hiding her in his room with the help of his sister, Pinky (Gunjan Malhotra). | Soon, his parents find out she is hiding in their house. Radhika and Pintoo run away again and she falls in love with him. The next day, after taking care of Gajendar and his men, Pintoo and his friends drop Radhika off at the airport to go to America. Radhika cries on the way there, not wanting to leave Pintoo. They bring her parents to see her one last time before she leaves. After Radhika is past airport security, Pintoo realizes he loves Radhika. She shows up behind him, saying that she was waiting for him to stop her. She turns to leave when Pintoo is silent, taking it as a refusal, but Pintoo calls her back, and they confirm their love with a hug. | Pintoo's police chief father (Raj Babbar) and Gajendar show up at the airport, and Pintoo's father arrests him while Gajendar takes Radhika away. While under Gajendar's jurisdiction, Radhika taunts him and says that Pintoo will definitely come for her. Gajendar goes to the jail and asks Pintoo to come with him. Here, Pintoo and his father solve their relationship, when Pintoo's father expresses that he's not worried Pintoo will come home hurt; rather, he's worried for Gajendar. | Gajendar and his men get Pintoo injured in front of the whole town. The Home Minister, who is the reason Gajendar has not gotten in trouble all this time, tells him to stop making a scene, as he's ruining his political party, but Gajendar slaps the minister and goes on to fight Pintoo. He is further enraged when he sees how much Radhika loves Pintoo, and stabs him with a knife. Pintoo falls to the ground. Radhika tries to run to him, crying his name, but Gajendar drags her away. Pintoo is able to get up again, picking up the scarf that Radhika dropped. He ties it around his waist where the knife wound is, and fights and defeats Gajender's men. He also defeats Gajender until Gajendar gets back up with a gun. However, he is shot down by Kakdi, his own right-hand man on the instructions of the Home Minister who has had enough of Gajender's antics and insubordination and it is implied that Kakdi has now been appointed as Gajender's replacement. With Gajender dead, his goons have no interest in Pintoo and Radhika who are reunited and go home and they get married.","m_cast":"Arjun Kapoor as Pintoo Shukla | Sonakshi Sinha as Radhika Mishra | Manoj Bajpayee as Gajendar Singh | Gunjan Malhotra as Pinky | Rajesh Sharma as Mahender Singh | Subrat Dutta as Kakdi | Raj Babbar as S.P Shukla | Deepti Naval as Pintoo's Mother | Shruti Haasan special appearance in song \"Madamiyan\"","m_reception":null,"m_production":"In November 2013, it was reported that Arjun Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha had joined an upcoming untitled film that was being produced by Boney Kapoor.
