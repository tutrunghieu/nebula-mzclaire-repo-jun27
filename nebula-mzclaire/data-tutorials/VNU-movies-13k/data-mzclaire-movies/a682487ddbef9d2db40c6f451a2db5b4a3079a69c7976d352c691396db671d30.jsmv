Upon entering the yeshiva, Yentl befriends a fellow student, Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin), and meets his fiancée, Hadass (Amy Irving). Things get complicated when Hadass's family cancels her wedding to Avigdor over fears that his family is tainted with insanity (his brother committed suicide), and decides that she should marry Anshel instead. Meanwhile, Hadass develops romantic feelings for Yentl (as Anshel), while Yentl herself is falling in love with Avigdor. After much turmoil, Avigdor and Hadass are reunited, while Yentl leaves Europe to go to the United States, where she hopes to lead a life with more freedom.","m_cast":"Barbra Streisand as Yentl Mendel | Mandy Patinkin as Avigdor | Amy Irving as Hadass Vishkower | Nehemiah Persoff as Rebbe Mendel | Steven Hill as Reb Alter Vishkower | Allan Corduner as Shimmele | Miriam Margolyes as Sarah","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The production of Barbra Streisand's film Yentl was a long and arduous process that delayed the project for over a decade. | After reading Isaac Singer's story \"Yentl: The Yeshiva Boy\" in 1968, Barbra Streisand sought to make it her next film after her completion of the successful film Funny Girl.[20] The screen rights were gained in 1969, with Streisand to be the star.[21] In 1971, the Czechoslovakian director, Ivan Passer, was originally hired by First Artists to direct the film, which was screenplayed by Singer and retitled Masquerade,[22] but due to his belief that Streisand's age and high celebrity status would detract from the film, backed out.[23] In 1973, Streisand read Singer's story to her then-boyfriend, producer Jon Peters, to gain further support for the film. However, like Passer, he was convinced that Streisand was too old and feminine to convincingly play the part the film would demand.[23] By 1976, after completing the film A Star Is Born, Streisand became convinced that she was, in fact, too old to play the part in Yentl, and would take up the film as director.[20] Due to her idealizations of being both the star and director, studios continued to draw back from funding the film, with fear that a rookie director would be unable to responsibly handle a multi-million dollar project.[24] Additionally, Streisand reported that studios claimed the film was \"not commercial\" because it was \"too ethnic\".[25] In 1978, Yentl was conceived to be a musical, as opposed to the original idea of being a drama, by Streisand's friends Alan and Marilyn Bergman. It was hoped that a musical starring Barbra Streisand would be accepted and better received by a studio.[26] | Jon Peters attempted to persuade Streisand to drop the project and perform at Wembley Stadium in London instead, for an offer of $1 million. She refused the offer as well as the $2 million follow-up to reconsider.[27] Another offer by Peters, which was to be in excess of $10 million for Streisand to perform in Las Vegas, was also promptly turned down in favor of pursuing the Yentl project.[28] Her attitude regarding her age quickly changed after she disguised herself as a man, temporarily confusing Peters into thinking that a stranger had broken into the house.[26] Peters, now convinced of her ability to play a male, agreed to sign a three-year production contract with Orion Pictures in March 1978.[29] To combat the age she was to play in the film, she changed Yentl from being 16 to 26.[26] | According to various sources, Streisand became increasingly inspired and determined to bring Yentl into production when, in the summer of 1979, she and her brother Sheldon (Streisand) visited their father's grave at Mount Hebron Cemetery for the first time in 30 years. For the sake of making memory of the occasion, Streisand had her brother take a photo of her standing next to her father's tombstone. The photo revealed that Emmanual Streisand's grave was directly next to that of a man named Anshel (the false name of the protagonist of Yentl). Intrigued, Barbra asked Sheldon to contact a psychic to perform a seance, convinced that her father was beckoning her from beyond the grave to complete the film.[30][31][32][33] | In 1979, Streisand finally made an agreement with Orion Pictures to direct and star in Yentl. She was working with a script by Ted Allen at the time, but discarded a majority of it, keeping the musical segments. The film was to be co-produced by Barbra's friends and associates: Joan Marshall Ashby and Jon Peters. To prepare for the film, Streisand exhaustively researched the many aspects of Judaism, ceremonies, relentless studying of the Torah, and consulted numerous rabbis,[29] one being Rabbi Lapin, whom Streisand appointed as the main consultant for the film.[34] | Orion Pictures made the announcement that it had agreed to produce Yentl as Barbra Streisand's directorial debut in the late summer of 1980. Traveling to Prague with a Super-8 camera and song lyrics, Streisand scouted out film locations while also shooting film of herself walking through the city in costume with early recordings of Yentl's soundtrack being played in the background.[35] However, not long after her return, Heaven's Gate, a Michael Cimino picture produced by United Artists, lost $35 million at the box office, bringing Orion to cancel all films that exceeded a $10 million cost in order to preserve itself. Yentl, which was priced at $14 million, was cancelled.[20] The film was turned down again and again until Jon Peters, Peter Gruber, and Neil Bogart formed PolyGram Pictures and agreed to produce the film. However, due to creative differences and personal disputes between Streisand and Peters, Yentl was dropped once again.[36] | 15 years after its original conception and 20 script variations later, Yentl's production finally began on April 14, 1982[37] in the Lee International Studios of London[38] after United Artists merged with MGM and gained the new leadership of Freddie Fields and David Begelman—Streisand's former agent from the late sixties.[39] Yentl was greenlighted as Streisand's directoral debut at a budget of $14.5 million.[40] Shooting concluded in October 1982, which was to be followed by Streisand requiring ten weeks to dub the soundtrack. In the end, the film went $1.5 million over budget, which Streisand paid for with her salary, as stated in the contract with UA.[41] | The film was shot on location in Prague, New York City, Liverpool and mainly in Žatec (Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic).[42]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Yentl  by Leah Napolin Isaac Bashevis Singer | Leah Napolin | Isaac Bashevis Singer","m_directed_by":"Barbra Streisand","m_produced_by":"Barbra Streisand | Larry DeWaay | Rusty Lemorande","m_screenplay_by":"Barbra Streisand | Jack Rosenthal","m_story_by":"Isaac Bashevis Singer","m_starring":"Barbra Streisand | Mandy Patinkin | Amy Irving","m_music_by":"Michel Legrand (Music) | Alan Bergman | Marilyn Bergman (Lyrics)","m_cinematography":"David Watkin","m_edited_by":"Terry Rawlings","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"MGM/UA Entertainment Company","m_release_dates":"November 18, 1983 (Limited) | January 6, 1984","m_running_time":"131 minutes | 136 minutes (Extended cut)","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$12 million","m_box_office":"$40,218,899[1] | Yentl is a 1983 American romantic musical drama film from United Artists (through MGM), and directed, co-written, co-produced, and starring Barbra Streisand based on the play of the same name by Leah Napolin and Isaac Bashevis Singer, itself based on Singer's short story \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\". | The dramatic story incorporates humor and music to relate the odyssey of an Ashkenazi Jewish girl in Poland who decides to dress and live like a man so that she can receive an education in Talmudic Law after her father dies. This cultural gender asymmetry that Yentl endures has been referenced in the medical community with the coining of the phrase Yentl Syndrome. The film's musical score and songs, composed by Michel Legrand, include the songs \"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\" and \"The Way He Makes Me Feel\", both sung by Streisand. The film received the Academy Award for Best Original Score and the Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Director for Streisand, making her the first woman to have won Best Director at the Golden Globes. Some circles consider Yentl one of the great musical films.[2][3][4][5] There are detractors of the film as well, including Isaac Bashevis Singer, writer of \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\", who said, \"I did not find artistic merit neither in the adaptation, nor in the directing.\"[6] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086619/business | ^ \"The 50 Best Movie Musicals of All Time\".
