{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 3028 A.D., humanity has mastered deep space travel and interacted with several alien species. A human invention called \"Project Titan\" alarms the Drej, a pure energy-based alien species. As the Drej start to attack Earth, Professor Sam Tucker, the lead researcher for \"Project Titan\", sends his son Cale on one of the evacuation ships with his alien friend Tek while Tucker and other members of his team fly the Titan spacecraft into hyperspace. When the Drej mothership destroys Earth and the Moon with a massive laser-like energy beam, the surviving humans become nomads, generally ridiculed by other alien species. | Fifteen years later, Cale is working in a salvage yard in an asteroid belt called Tau 14. He is tracked down by Joseph Korso, captain of the spaceship Valkyrie. Korso reveals that Professor Tucker encoded a map to the Titan in Cale's ring. Tek tells Cale that humanity depends on finding the Titan. When the Drej attack the salvage yard, Cale is forced to escape aboard the Valkyrie with Korso and his crew: Akima, a human female pilot; and Preed, Gune, and Stith, aliens of various species. | On the planet Sesharrim, the bat-like Gaoul interpret the map and discover the Titan is hidden in the Andali Nebula. Drej fighters arrive and capture Cale and Akima. The Drej eventually discard Akima and extract the Titan's map from Cale. Korso's crew rescues Akima while Cale eventually escapes in a Drej ship and rejoins the group. Cale's map has changed and now shows the Titan's final location. | While resupplying at a human space station called New Bangkok, Cale and Akima discover that Korso and Preed are planning to betray the Titan to the Drej. Cale and Akima manage to escape the Valkyrie but are then stranded on New Bangkok when Korso and the rest of the crew set off for the Titan. With the help of New Bangkok's colonists, Cale and Akima salvage a small spaceship named Phoenix and race to find the Titan before Korso. | Cale and Akima navigate through the huge ice field in the Andali Nebula and dock with the Titan before the Valkyrie arrives. They discover DNA samples of Earth animals and a pre-recorded holographic message left by Cale's father. Professor Tucker explains that the Titan was designed to create an Earth-like planet; however, its power cells lack the energy necessary for the process. The message is interrupted by the arrival of Korso and Preed. Preed attempts to double-cross Korso, but he kills him. Moments later, the Drej attack the Titan. While the remaining crew of the Valkyrie distracts them, Cale - given the fact that Drej are, essentially, beings of pure energy - modifies the Titan to absorb them, thus re-energizing the ship. A repentant Korso sacrifices his life to help Cale complete the repairs. The Titan absorbs the Drej mothership along with everyone aboard and uses gained power to mold the ice field into a new habitable planet. | While on the newly-formed Planet \"Bob\" (named by Cale), Cale and Akima witness the weather of the new planet as it begins to rain. Stith and Gune leave on the Valkyrie as human colony ships approach the planet to start life anew.","m_cast":"Matt Damon as Cale Tucker, a male yard-salvager who carries the map to Titan in his ring.

He cited the Ice Rings sequence as \"a perfect examine [sic] of what animation can do and live action cannot\".[19] | The film opened at #5, with $9,376,845 for an average of $3,430 from 2,734 theaters.[20] The film then lost 60% of its audience in its second weekend, dropping to #8, with a gross of $3,735,300 for an average of $1,346 from 2,775 theaters.[21] The film ended up grossing only $36,754,634 worldwide ($22,753,426 in the United States and Canada, and $14,001,208 in international markets).[20] The film's budget is estimated at between $75 million[20] and $90 million.[22] According to Chris Meledandri, the supervisor of the film, Titan A.E. lost $100 million for 20th Century Fox.[1] After the film's failure, Fox Animation Studios was shut down. | Titan A.E. won a Golden Reel Award for \"Best Sound Editing for an Animated Feature\",[23] and was nominated by the same organization for \"Best Sound Editing for Music in Animation\", and a Satellite Award for \"Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media\", losing both to Chicken Run.[24][25] The film was also nominated for three Annie Awards, including \"Outstanding Achievement in An Animated Theatrical Feature\", \"Effects Animation\", and \"Production Design\" which it lost to Toy Story 2 and Fantasia 2000, respectively,[26] and was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at 27th Saturn Awards, but lost to X-Men, another film from 20th Century Fox.[27] Drew Barrymore was nominated for \"Best Voice-Over Performance\" by the Online Film & Television Association for her role as Akima, but was beaten by Eartha Kitt from The Emperor's New Groove.[28]","m_production":"The story of Titan A.E. had been in development at 20th Century Fox since 1998, and was originally intended to be a live-action science fiction film.[2] The script had been passed around to various writers, such as Ben Edlund and Joss Whedon, and had been given to an undisclosed director. After $30 million had been spent in the film's early development with no progress, the director was sacked. Then-chairman of 20th Century Fox Bill Mechanic gave the script to Fox Animation producers Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, who were fresh from the success of their recent film Anastasia. Mechanic had no scripts for Fox Animation to work on, and was faced with the choice of laying off the animation staff unless they took Titan A.E.. Bluth and Goldman, who were not fans of science fiction, took the script regardless.[3] | Fox Animation Studios were given a budget of $75 million dollars and 19 months to produce the film. Unlike Bluth and Goldman's previous films, the animation in Titan A.E. is predominantly computer-generated, while main characters and several backgrounds were traditionally animated. Many of the scenes were enacted by the animation staff using handbuilt props before being captured by a computer. Many scenes and backgrounds were painted by concept artist Paul Cheng, who had worked on Anastasia and its direct-to-video spinoff Bartok the Magnificent.[4] Like Anastasia, the storytelling and tone in Titan A.E. is much darker and edgier than Bluth and Goldman's previous films, with the film being regularly compared to Japanese anime. Although Bluth and Goldman denied any influence by anime, they have acknowledged the comparison.[2] | During the production of Titan A.E., Fox Animation suffered a number of cutbacks which ultimately led to its closure in 2000. Over 300 animation staff were laid off from the studio in 1999, and as a result much of the film's animation was outsourced to a number of independent companies.[5] Several scenes were contracted to David Paul Dozoretz's POVDE group, the \"Wake Angels\" scene was animated by Reality Check Studios (their first feature film work),[6] while the film's \"genesis\" scene was animated by Blue Sky Studios, who would later go on to animating 20th Century Fox's Ice Age and Rio film franchises as well as The Peanuts Movie. Under pressure from executives, Bill Mechanic was dismissed from 20th Century Fox prior to Titan A.E.'s release, eventuating in the closure of Fox Animation Studios on June 27, 2000, ten days after the film's release. All these events stunted the film's promotion and distribution.[3] | The film's score was composed by Graeme Revell. The soundtrack also contains \"Over My Head\" performed by Lit, \"The End is Over\" performed by Powerman 5000, \"Cosmic Castaway\" performed by Electrasy, \"Everything Under the Stars\" performed by Fun Lovin' Criminals, \"It's My Turn to Fly\" performed by The Urge, \"Like Lovers (Holding On)\" performed by Texas, \"Not Quite Paradise\" performed by Bliss 66, \"Everybody's Going to the Moon\" performed by Jamiroquai, \"Karma Slave\" performed by Splashdown, \"Renegade Survivor\" performed by The Wailing Souls and \"Down to Earth\" performed by Luscious Jackson.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Don Bluth Gary Goldman","m_produced_by":"Don Bluth Gary Goldman David Kirschner","m_screenplay_by":"Ben Edlund John August Joss Whedon","m_story_by":"Hans Bauer Randall McCormick","m_starring":"Matt Damon Bill Pullman John Leguizamo Nathan Lane Janeane Garofalo Drew Barrymore","m_music_by":"Graeme Revell","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Bob Bender Paul Martin Smith Fiona Trayler","m_production_company":"Fox Animation Studios David Kirschner Productions","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"June 16, 2000 (2000-06-16) (U.S.) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$75–90 million","m_box_office":"$36.8 million | Titan A.E. is a 2000 American animated science fiction action-adventure film directed and produced by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman.
