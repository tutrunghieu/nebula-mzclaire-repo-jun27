Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau), a liberal street preacher and political organizer, who insists to Tibbs that he was merely visiting the hooker in a professional capacity, advising her spiritually. | Tibbs questions a janitor from the victim's building, Mealie (Juano Hernandez), as well as another man, Woody Garfield (Edward Asner), who might have been the woman's pimp. Suspicion falls on a man named Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe), who takes umbrage and is shot by Tibbs in self-defense. | Tibbs concludes that Sharpe really must be the culprit. Sharpe confesses but requests Tibbs give him some time to complete his work on one last political issue. Told this wouldn't be possible, Sharpe takes his own life.","m_cast":"Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs | Martin Landau as Logan Sharpe | Barbara McNair as Valerie Tibbs | Anthony Zerbe as Rice Weedon | Edward Asner as Woody Garfield | Jeff Corey as Captain Marden | Norma Crane as Marge Garfield | Juano Hernandez as Mealie Williamson | David Sheiner as Lieutenant Kenner | Beverly Todd as Puff | Ted Gehring as Sergeant Deutsch | Linda Towne as Joy Sturges | Garry Walberg as Medical Examiner | George Spell as Andy Tibbs | Wanda Spell as Ginger Tibbs","m_reception":"Released in 1970, the film did not attract the same response as In the Heat of the Night. | The film has a 60% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of June 2009.[4]","m_production":"Quincy Jones wrote the score, as he did with In the Heat of the Night, although the tone of the music in both is markedly different.
