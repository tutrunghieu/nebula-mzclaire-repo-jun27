{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":"When The Atomic Cafe was released, film critic Roger Ebert discussed the style and methods the filmmakers used, writing, \"The makers of The Atomic Cafe sifted through thousands of feet of Army films, newsreels, government propaganda films and old television broadcasts to come up with the material in their film, which is presented without any narration, as a record of some of the ways in which the bomb entered American folklore. There are songs, speeches politicians, and frightening documentary footage of guinea-pig American troops shielding themselves from an atomic blast and then exposing themselves to radiation neither they nor their officers understood.\"[16] | Critic Vincent Canby of the New York Times praised the film, calling the film \"a devastating collage-film that examines official and unofficial United States attitudes toward the atomic age\" and a film that \"deserves national attention.\"[9] Canby was so taken by The Atomic Cafe that he mentioned it in a subsequent articles—comparing it, favorably, to the blockbuster Porky's.[17] | More recently, critic Glenn Erickson discussed the editorial message of the film's producers: \"The makers of The Atomic Cafe clearly have a message to get across, and to achieve that goal they use the inherent absurdity of their source material in creative ways. But they're careful to make sure they leave them essentially untransformed. When we see Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover posing with a strip of microfilm, we know we're watching a newsreel. The content isn't cheated. Except in wrapup montages, narration from one source isn't used over another. When raw footage is available, candid moments are seen of speechmakers (including President Truman) when they don't know the cameras are rolling. Caught laughing incongruously before a solemn report on an atom threat, Truman comes off not as callous, but human.\" | The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 14 reviews.\"[18] | Deirdre Boyle, an Associate Professor and Academic Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Documentary Media Studies at The New School and an author of Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited, claimed that \"By compiling propaganda or fictions denying 'nuclear-truth', The Atomic Cafe reveals the American public’s lack of resistance to the fear generated by the government propaganda films and the misinformation they generated. Whether Americans of the time lacked the ability to resist or reject this misinformation about the atomic bomb is a debatable truth.”[19] | Boston Society of Film Critics: BSFC Award, Best Documentary; 1983. | British Academy Film Awards: Flaherty Documentary Award, Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce Rafferty; 1983.","m_production":"The Atomic Cafe was produced over a five-year period through the collaborative efforts of three directors: Jayne Loader and brothers Kevin and Pierce Rafferty.[7] For this film, the Rafferty brothers and Loader formed a production company called The Archives Project. The filmmakers opted not to use narration. Instead, they deployed carefully constructed sequences of film clips to make their points. Jayne Loader has referred to The Atomic Cafe as \"compilation verite\": a compilation film with no \"Voice of God\" narration and no new footage added by the filmmakers.[8] The soundtrack utilizes atomic-themed songs from the Cold War era to underscore the themes of the film.[9] | The film cost $300,000 to make. The group did receive some financial support from outside sources, including the Film Fund, a New York City based non-profit.[10] Grants comprised a nominal amount of the team’s budget, and the film was largely funded by the filmmakers themselves. Jayne Loader stated in an interview, “Had we relied on grants, we would have starved\" [11] Pierce Rafferty helped to support the team and the film financially by working as a consultant and researcher on several other documentary films including El Salvador—Another Vietnam, With Babies and Banners, and The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter.[12] The Rafferty brothers had also received an inheritance that they used to support the team during the five years it took to make the film.[11] About 75% of the film is made up of government materials that were in the public domain. Though they could use those public domain materials for free, they had to make copies of the films at their own expense. This along with the newsreel and commercial stock footage that comprises the other 25% of the film (along with the music royalties) represents the bulk of the trio’s expenditures.[12]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jayne Loader Kevin Rafferty Pierce Rafferty","m_produced_by":"Jayne Loader Kevin Rafferty Pierce Rafferty","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":"Consultant: Charles Wolfe","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Jayne Loader Kevin Rafferty","m_production_company":"The Archives Project","m_distributed_by":"Libra Films","m_release_dates":"March 17, 1982 (1982-03-17) (New York City) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"86 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Atomic Cafe is a 1982 American documentary film produced and directed by Jayne Loader, Kevin Rafferty and Pierce Rafferty.[1] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ The Atomic Cafe at the American Film Institute Catalog. | ^ McLane Betsy. \"Film Quarterly\", film review, Spring 1983.
