Lymon's career was over by the time he was 18 years old, and he died of a heroin overdose seven years later. | Jumping from the 1950s to the 1960s, the film traces the rise and fall of Lymon (Larenz Tate) in a series of flashbacks as courtroom claims on Lymon's royalties are outlined by three women: Zola Taylor (Halle Berry) of the R&B group The Platters; Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox), who loves her pet dog (who Lymon kills by mistake, when it bites his hand after threatening to throw it out a window during an argument between him and Elizabeth) and who became a prostitute to cover the costs of Lymon's recovery from addiction; and schoolteacher Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon). Ending credits shows the real Frankie Lymon singing his song \"Goody Goody.\" | Little Richard also makes a courtroom appearance, while Miguel A. Nunez, Jr. portrays Little Richard in scenes set in the 1950s. | The film ends with Emira winning Frankie's estate, although Elizabeth was named the legal surviving spouse of Frankie Lymon.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, was disappointed in the screenplay and ultimately Nava's direction of the film, and wrote, \"There are several angles this material might have been approached from, and director Gregory Nava tries several without hitting on one that works. By the end of the film, we're not even left with anyone to root for; we realize with a little astonishment, waiting for the court verdict, that we don't care who wins.\"[4] | Yet, film critic Peter Stack liked the film and believes director Nava smartly juggles a lot of elements in the picture. He wrote, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love is a fresh, enlightening example of how to take a tragic American show-business story and make it funny, warm and terrifically entertaining...[it] brims with joyful spirit and raucous comedy...[and the film] deftly juggles a surprising number of elements, but they all work.\"[5] | Wins | ALMA Award: Outstanding Latino Director of a Feature Film, Gregory Nava, 1999. | American Black Film Festival: Black Film Award; Best Actor, Larenz Tate, 1999. | Nominations | ALMA Awards: Outstanding Actor in a Feature Film in a Crossover Role, Miguel A.
