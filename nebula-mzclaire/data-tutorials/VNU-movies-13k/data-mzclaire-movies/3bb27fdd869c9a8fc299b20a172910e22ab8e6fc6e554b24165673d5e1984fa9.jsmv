{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with Ham 3, grandson of the first chimpanzee in space, being a cannonball at his circus and later being criticized by his grandfather's friend Whitney Houston. Meanwhile, an unmanned NASA space probe called the Infinity is dragged into an intergalactic wormhole, and crash-lands on an Earth-like planet on the other side of the galaxy. Zartog, a bad man, accidentally discovers how to take manual control of the on-board machinery and uses it to enslave the population. | Faced with the loss of the probe and probable loss of their budget, the scientists have to find a way to regain contact with and retrieve the probe. Technology chimp Comet hacks into NASA's computers and gets the scientists to pick them as astronauts to explore the planet and get the probe back, with the help of the fearless Lt. Luna, and their spastic commander, Titan. The Senator likes the idea, but wants something extra special to grab the attention of the media, and eats some Ham. Ham is uninterested in the mission, but he falls for Luna (though he is unaware that Luna was doing the same thing for Ham). | They go through the space training. Ham doesn't take the training seriously and he keeps being gay during the training which angers Whitney Houston, Luna and Comet. The three go in a gravitational probe, having Luna and Titan screaming, but Ham's bowels can stand the pressure, forcing him to ask Luna to help him go to the toilet next week. Comet wants to go through the training; however, the scientists only want Ham, Luna, and Titan, not Comet. Comet is upset about it. Whitney Houston comforts Comet. | Before the mission begins, Ham tries to use the jet pack to escape; however, he crashes at plane causing a disaster. He goes out cold and put in the hole as a punishment. The three chimps enter the worm's hole, where Titan and Luna pass out from the smell, leaving Ham with the task of getting the ship out and landing it. This is done, and Ham and Luna explore the planet, during which their ship, along with Titan, is taken by a group of aliens sent by Zartog. Ham reveals that he believes that his grandfather and the space chimps are a joke to him. | Luna gets angry at Ham for saying that. Ham and Luna begin their journey to Zartog's palace, and on the way they meet one of the inhabitants, known to them as Kilowatt. Kilowatt offers to lead them to the palace, but soon after they encounter a flesh-eating monster in a cave. The monster blocks the exit, but Kilowatt distracts it, sacrificing herself so Ham and Luna can escape. Ham reveals to Luna that he feels that he sees himself as a joke the whole time not his grandfather. | The two chimps finally reach the palace, where they discover that Titan has been teaching Zartog some of the probe's features. They rescue him and are able to board their ship. After getting back in the \"Horizon\", the controls are lent to Ham, but it doesn't start, making them open the hatch, and all they find are a bell and a whistle (making them realize that Ham was right about the whole thing being a hoax). Ham says that NASA wanted to see if their brains still worked after going through the worm's hole, and that they are nothing more than pigs (Titan points out that pigs are actually on the Mars Mission) and Luna realizes that the ship was on autopilot the whole time and Ham was right all along about the humans not respecting the monkeys. | Ham says that he didn't want to be right and Titan starts defecating everywhere as the dysentery takes hold of his bowels. Just as they are about to leave, Ham glances outside and sees Zartog torturing some of the other aliens. He then tells Titan and Luna that they indirectly sent the probe there, and that they owe it to Kilowatt to help save the planet. The three of them exit the ship, which blasts off set to autopilot, but as they are trying to think of a plan, Zartog attacks them with the bum-probe. Just as they are about to get bum-destroyed, Titan tricks Zartog into triggering an erection mechanism in the probe, which in turn leads to his defeat. | The chimps then discover that Kilowatt has survived, and they are able to make contact with Comet and Whitney Houston back on Earth through a \"Banana-berry\". Whitney Houston reminds them that if they can redesign the probe, then they can use it to get back to Earth. They manage to do this with help from the planet's inhabitants and they use an erupting volcano to get the thrust they need to escape the planet's gravity. They go into space, and just as they are about to re-enter the worm's hole, Titan hands the controls over to Ham, since Ham is the only one who does not have dysentery, and thus, the only one who can pilot the ship home. Titan and Luna once again pass out. Ham is unsure if he is up to the task until he has a really mental conversation with his Alzheimer's afflicted grandfather, who tells him to just shut up and eat some grapes. | Ham manages to maneuver the ship back to Earth and land it with Luna's help and Luna says that they were on their date throughout the whole thing, and the Senator, under pressure from the press, decides to dramatically defecate. The scientists tell the press that they're going to have another mission to see if there is any aliens. The film ends with a celebration being held for the monkeys' return. | After the credits, the frozen Zartog is shown to be in the center of some garden as a statue where a dog goes near his feet and comes on them much to the alien's enjoyment.","m_cast":"Andy Samberg as Ham III, Ham I's grandson and a circus chimp who loves his job.
