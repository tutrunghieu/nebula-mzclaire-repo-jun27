{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Giulia (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) and Carlo (Stefano Accorsi) have been happy together for three years, but Giulia's announcement that she is pregnant sends him into a secret panic. Terrified at his imminent entry into the adult world of irreversible responsibilities, Carlo finds himself tempted by a bewitching 18-year-old girl, Francesca (Martina Stella), whom he meets by chance at a wedding. The possibility of one last youthful crazy fling before the impending prison of parenthood proves to be too attractive to resist. | But a short-term fling with Francesca comes with serious consequences that threaten to damage his three-year relationship with Giulia, who is expecting a baby girl. At the same time, it also dashes the idealistic hopes of Francesca, who dreams of a beautiful future with him. After a raucous quarrel in the night, Carlo goes to Francesca's house, where they have sex. However, the morning after, reality sinks on Carlo and the enormity of what he had done surfaces. But it is not easy for Giulia to forgive, or to trust him again.","m_cast":"Giovanna Mezzogiorno: Giulia | Stefano Accorsi: Carlo | Stefania Sandrelli: Anna | Martina Stella: Francesca | Pierfrancesco Favino: Marco | Claudio Santamaria: Paolo | Sabrina Impacciatore: Livia | Giorgio Pasotti: Adriano | Sergio Castellitto: Prof. Eugenio Bonetti | Regina Orioli: Arianna | Marco Cocci: Alberto | Luigi Diberti: Emilio | Daniela Piazza: Veronica | Lina Bernardi: Adele | Piero Natoli: Michele | Vittorio Amandola: Mimmo | Giulia Carmignani: Mariposa | Silvio Muccino: fiancee of Mariposa | Carmen Consoli: lover of Alberto","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Gabriele Muccino","m_produced_by":"Domenico Procacci","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Stefano Accorsi Giovanna Mezzogiorno","m_music_by":"Paolo Buonvino","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"THINKFilm","m_release_dates":"2 February 2001 (Italy) 16 August 2002 (USA)","m_running_time":"115 min","m_country":null,"m_language":"Italian","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$17,720,347 | The Last Kiss (Italian: L'ultimo bacio [ˈlultimo ˈbatʃo]) is a 2001 Italian comedy-drama film written and directed by Gabriele Muccino. | It was remade into The Last Kiss in 2006 by Tony Goldwyn starring Zach Braff and Rachel Bilson. | A sequel to the film (Italian: Baciami ancora; English: Kiss me again) was released in Italy in February 2010.","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Last Kiss at the Internet Movie Database | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/L%27ultimo_bacio.jpg/220px-L%27ultimo_bacio.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Gabriele Muccino"}
