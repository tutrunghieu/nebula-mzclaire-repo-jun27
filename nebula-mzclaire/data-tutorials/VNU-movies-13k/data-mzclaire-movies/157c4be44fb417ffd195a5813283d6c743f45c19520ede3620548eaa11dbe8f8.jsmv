It doesn't really capture how Jim was at all. This gives you a much better insight into how his mind worked, I think.’[9] | Overall Krieger felt ‘really happy’ about how the film has turned out, crediting in particular the editing work. The surviving members of the band decided not to get too involved in the project to try to get the right neutral balance that an outsider would try to achieve.\"[9] | The film was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Series following its airing on American Masters on PBS.[10] In December 2010 the film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video and subsequently won the award in February 2011.[11]","m_production":"The documentary was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2009.[3] It received somewhat favorable reviews from that showing, but the narration (by director DiCillo) was singled out by most viewers as very seriously flawed for its monotonic delivery. Due to the rash of complaints about the narration, Johnny Depp was hired to redub it. A few months later, DiCillo pronounced the film \"just about locked\" and announced that there would be a showing of the new \"redux\" version. It debuted at the Los Angeles Film Festival on Sunday, June 21, 2009. | The completed film was also shown at the London Film Festival on October 16–18, 2009. The film was released in theaters on April 9, 2010,[4] with a soundtrack release on April 6, 2010. It was released in Canada on April 15, 2010. PBS showed this film as part of its series American Masters on May 12, 2010.[5] The film was released on DVD on June 29, 2010.[6][7] In France the film, distributed by MK2, was released under its original title and received an excellent reception.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tom DiCillo","m_produced_by":"John Beug Jeff Jampol Peter Jankowski","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":"The Doors","m_cinematography":"Paul Ferrara","m_edited_by":"Micky Blythe Kevin Krasny","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Rhino Entertainment","m_release_dates":"January 17, 2009 (2009-01-17) (Sundance) | April 9, 2010 (2010-04-09) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"86 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | When You're Strange is a 2009 documentary about The Doors.
