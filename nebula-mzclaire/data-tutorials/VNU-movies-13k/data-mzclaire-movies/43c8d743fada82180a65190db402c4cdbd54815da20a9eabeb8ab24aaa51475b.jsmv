{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the Antarctic, a Norwegian helicopter pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station, shooting at the dog from the helicopter. Upon landing, a Norwegian accidentally drops a thermite charge, destroying the helicopter, and killing the pilot. The surviving Norwegian pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans decide to send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin containing corpses. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video tapes, maps and papers. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs. | Clark finally kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs, after it had been allowed to wonder around freely since its arrival. The dog soon metamorphoses and attacks them. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature as everyone watches in horror. Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms. The Norwegians' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station's geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old. Blair becomes increasingly paranoid and withdraws, calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated within a few years. Fuchs tells MacReady that he is worried about Blair, and that according to Blair's journal, the creature's \"dead\" remains are still active on a cellular level. The camp enacts safety measures designed to reduce risk of assimilation. | The creature assimilates Bennings, but Windows catches him outside before his metamorphosis is complete and MacReady burns the creature before it can escape. They discover Blair has wrecked all the transports and killed the remaining sled dogs. The team corners Blair as he is destroying the radio and locks him in an isolated tool shed. Copper recommends a blood-serum test to determine who is assimilated, but the paranoid men turn on each other when they find the blood stores have been sabotaged. | MacReady takes charge and orders Fuchs to continue Blair's work, but Fuchs disappears; MacReady, Windows, and Nauls find his burned body outside. Windows returns to warn the others while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's personal shack. On the way back, Nauls cuts MacReady loose from the tow line. He assumes that MacReady has been assimilated when he finds a torn shirt with MacReady's name on it. As the team debates MacReady's fate, he breaks in through a window in the supply room and threatens to destroy the station with a bundle of dynamite if they attack him. Norris appears to suffer a heart attack after he and Nauls unsuccessfully attack MacReady from behind. | When Copper attempts to revive him, Norris transforms and kills Copper. MacReady incinerates the creature and orders Windows to tie up everyone for a new test. Clark attacks MacReady with a scalpel, and MacReady kills him. MacReady explains his theory that every piece of the alien is an individual organism with its own survival instinct. One by one, MacReady tests everyone's blood with a heated piece of copper wire. Everyone is still human except Palmer, whose blood flees from the hot wire. Exposed, Palmer metamorphoses and attacks Windows, forcing MacReady to burn them both. | Leaving Childs on guard, the others head out to test Blair, only to find that he has tunneled out of the tool shed and into an underground area that he created. They realize that Blair is assimilated and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft. Nauls spots Childs running outside into the snow storm just before the station's power goes out. MacReady blows up the escape craft with dynamite. After returning to the main building, they discover that the station's power generator has been destroyed. MacReady speculates that the Thing now intends to hibernate until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex, hoping to destroy the Thing. While setting the explosives, Garry is killed and Nauls disappears. As MacReady rushes to set the charges, Blair, now metamorphosed into a larger monster emerges from below and destroys the detonator. MacReady triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite, and the base explodes. | MacReady sits nearby as the camp burns, and Childs reappears. Childs claims he thought he saw Blair and went out after him, but ended up lost in the storm. They discuss their prospects of survival and distrust of each other, eventually deciding to stay put and \"see what happens\". MacReady offers Childs a bottle of whiskey, and chuckles, resigned that they will both probably freeze to death, and that he doesn't know whether Childs is human or not.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"\"I take every failure hard. The one I took the hardest was The Thing. My career would have been different if that had been a big hit...The movie was hated. Even by science-fiction fans. They thought that I had betrayed some kind of trust, and the piling on was insane. Even the original movie's director, Christian Nyby, was dissing me.\" | The film received negative reviews upon release.[24] The film's makeup special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive. Film critic Roger Ebert called the film \"disappointing\", though said he found it scary and that it was \"a great barf-bag movie.\" However, he criticized what he felt were poor characterizations and illogical plot elements, ultimately giving the film 2½ stars out of 4.[25] In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it \"a foolish, depressing, overproduced movie that mixes horror with science fiction to make something that is fun as neither one thing or the other. Sometimes it looks as if it aspired to be the quintessential moron movie of the 80s.\"[26] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, \"Designer Rob Bottin's work is novel and unforgettable, but since it exists in a near vacuum emotionally, it becomes too domineering dramatically and something of an exercise in abstract art.\"[27] | In his review for the Washington Post, Gary Arnold called the film \"a wretched excess.\"[28] Jay Scott, in his review for the Globe and Mail, called the film \"a hell of an antidote to E.T.\"[29] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, \"Astonishingly, Carpenter blows it. There's a big difference between shock effects and suspense, and in sacrificing everything at the altar of gore, Carpenter sabotages the drama. The Thing is so single-mindedly determined to keep you awake that it almost puts you to sleep.\"[30] David Denby of New York magazine wrote that the original story may have influenced Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien, but a new adaptation seems derivative.[31] In his book Science Fiction (1984), Phil Hardy described the film as a \"surprising failure\" and \"Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date.\"[32] The review noted that the narrative \"seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero is no more than a cypher compared to Kenneth Tobey's rounded character in Howard Hawks' The Thing\".[32] | Despite negative contemporary reviews, the film has been reappraised substantially in the years following its release, and now maintains an 80% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the site's consensus states: \"Grimmer and more terrifying than the 1950s take, John Carpenter's The Thing is a tense sci-fi thriller rife with compelling tension and some remarkable make-up effects.\"[33] It has been listed as one of the best of 1982 by Filmsite.org and Film.com.[34][35] The film ranked #97 on Rotten Tomatoes' Journey Through Sci-Fi (100 Best-Reviewed Sci-Fi Movies), and a scene from The Thing was listed as #48 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.[36] Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 17th scariest film ever made.[37] The Thing was named \"the scariest movie . . . ever!\" by the staff of the Boston Globe.[10] In 2008, the film was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[38] PopMatters and WorldsGreatestCritic.com journalist J.C. Maçek III wrote \"The true beauty of The Thing is that it remains a challenging mystery throughout its 109 minute runtime. As was so effectively handled in Alien, the real scares come from what we don't know or can't quite see.\"[39] John Kenneth Muir, writing in Horror Movies of the 1980s, called it \"Carpenter's most accomplished and underrated directorial effort\". Muir goes on to say that it is \"the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade\".[11] | In 2011, The New York Times asked prominent horror filmmakers what film they had found the scariest. Two, John Sayles and Edgar Wright, cited The Thing. \"The theater was full, and I had to sit in the front row,\" Sayles recalled.[40] | The Thing received nominations from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films for Best Horror Film and Best Special Effects, but lost to Poltergeist and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, respectively. The film was nominated in the Razzie Awards for Worst Musical Score.[41]","m_production":"A number of early drafts for the film were written by Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, co-creators of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.[13] The final screenplay was written in 1981 by Bill Lancaster, son of Burt Lancaster.[14] Carpenter later recalled that he did not meet or collaborate with any of the screenwriters.[15] The film was shot near the small town of Stewart in northern British Columbia. The research station in the film was built by the film crew during summer, and the film shot in sub-freezing winter conditions. The only female presence in the film is the voice of a chess computer, voiced by Carpenter regular (and then-wife) Adrienne Barbeau, as well as the female contestants viewed on a videotaped episode of Let's Make a Deal. | According to the sign post outside the camp, the Antarctic research team is stationed at the United States National Science Institute Station 4. However, in early drafts of the script, the base was called, \"U.S. Outpost 31\".[16] When making a recording of events, Kurt Russell's character, MacReady, signs off as, \"R.J. Macready, helicopter pilot, U.S. Outpost #31\". | The film took three months to shoot on six artificially frozen sound stages in Los Angeles, with many of the crew and actors working in cold conditions.[14] The final weeks of shooting took place in northern British Columbia, near the border with Alaska, where snow was guaranteed to fall.[14] John Carpenter filmed the Norwegian camp scenes at the end of production. The Norwegian camp was simply the remains of the American outpost after it was destroyed by an explosion.[17] | The Thing was Carpenter's eighth time directing a full-length feature and his first film under the production of a major film studio (Universal Studios). | The Thing was the fourth film shot by cinematographer Dean Cundey (following Carpenter's Halloween, The Fog, and Escape from New York) and the third to feature Kurt Russell as the lead actor. Russell would appear in two additional Carpenter films following The Thing: Big Trouble in Little China and Escape from L.A. Most of the special creature effects were designed and created by Rob Bottin and his crew, with the exception of the dog creature, which was created by Stan Winston.[17] Winston was brought in when Bottin's team found themselves overloaded with work on the other creatures seen in the film.[17] | The film was shot anamorphically for the 2.39:1 \"scope\" ratio. | In the documentary Terror Takes Shape on the DVD, film editor Todd C. Ramsay states that he made the suggestion to Carpenter to film a \"happy\" ending for the film, purely for protective reasons, while they had Russell available. Carpenter agreed and shot a scene in which MacReady has been rescued and administered a blood test, proving that he is still human. Ramsay follows this by saying that The Thing had two test screenings, but Carpenter did not use the sequence in either of them, as the director felt that the film worked better with its eventual nihilistic conclusion. The alternate ending with MacReady definitively proven to be human has yet to be released. | According to the 1998 DVD release, the \"Blair Monster\" was to have had a much larger role in the final battle. However, due to the limitations of stop-motion animation, the monster appears for only a few seconds in the film. | One of the film's associate producers, Larry J. Franco, has a credited cameo as the Norwegian rifleman from the beginning of the film. Director John Carpenter and his then-wife Adrienne Barbeau have uncredited cameos as a man in the Norwegian video footage and the voice of the chess computer, respectively. | Although the production's helicopter pilots are not characters within the film and only serve as body doubles when the helicopters are in flight, they are listed under the credits. Nate Irvin is listed as Helicopter Pilot and William Zeman is listed as Pilot. | Two names were changed from Bill Lancaster's second draft of the script.[16] The character Windows was originally named Sanchez, who was described as \"hating it here\" and \"lousy at his job\". The second character changed is the Norwegian rifleman, who was identified as \"Jans Bolan\" in a deleted scene from his dogtags and named Lars according to the 2011 prequel. | The film's musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone, a rare instance of Carpenter not scoring one of his own films,[18] although Carpenter did score a few pieces of music with Alan Howarth which were also used in the final film.[19] In 2012, Morricone recalled, | Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, as he was preparing some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, \"Why did you call me, if you want to do it on your own?\" He surprised me, he said - \"I got married to your music. This is why I've called you.\" I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [Carpenter] took the electronic score.[20]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Who Goes There?  by John W.

The film's title refers to its primary antagonist: a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them. The Thing infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it absorbs, and paranoia develops within the group. | The film is based on John W. Campbell, Jr.'s novella Who Goes There?, which was more loosely adapted by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby as the 1951 film The Thing from Another World.[3] Carpenter considers The Thing to be the first part of his Apocalypse Trilogy,[4] followed by Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness. Although the films are narratively unrelated, each features a potentially apocalyptic scenario; should \"The Thing\" ever reach civilization, it would be only a matter of time before it consumes humanity. | On June 25, 1982, The Thing opened in 840 theaters, and it was the #8 movie of the week at the box office. It remained in the top 10 for three weeks.[5] The lower-than-expected performance has been attributed to many factors, including Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which was also released by Universal Studios around the same time and featured a more optimistic view of alien visitation,[6][7] and another popular science fiction film, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, being released on the same day.[8] However, The Thing went on to gain a cult following.[9] The film was eventually reappraised by critics, and is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made.[10][11] The film subsequently spawned a novelization in 1982; a comic book miniseries adaptation, entitled The Thing from Another World, published by Dark Horse Comics in 1991; a video game sequel, also titled The Thing, in 2002; and a prequel film with the same title on October 14, 2011. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Thing at the Internet Movie Database | The Thing at AllMovie | The Thing at the TCM Movie Database | The Thing at the American Film Institute Catalog | The Thing at Box Office Mojo | The Thing at Rotten Tomatoes | The Thing at theofficialjohncarpenter.com | Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum's Set Visit | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/ThingPoster.jpg/220px-ThingPoster.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
