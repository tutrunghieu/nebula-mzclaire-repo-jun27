It stars many of MGM leading talents, including Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, Lucille Bremer, Fanny Brice (the only member of the ensemble who was a star of the original Follies), Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, Lena Horne, Gene Kelly, James Melton, Victor Moore, William Powell, Red Skelton, and Esther Williams. | Producer Arthur Freed wanted to create a film along the lines of the Ziegfeld Follies Broadway shows and so the film is composed of a sequence of unrelated lavish musical numbers and comedy sketches. Filmed in 1944, '45 and '46,[3] it was released in 1946, to considerable critical and box-office success. | The film was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.[4] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c \"The Eddie Mannix Ledger\".
