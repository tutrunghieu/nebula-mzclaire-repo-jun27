{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"For five years, Superman (Brandon Routh) has abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey to visit the remains of Krypton. His seemingly selfish decision has ruined his image in the eyes of many, including journalist Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who writes a scathing article claiming that the world \"doesn't need Superman\". Scientist Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who lost his fame and fortune after being exposed as a criminal by Superman, secures an early release from prison and marries an old heiress, whose subsequent death makes him wealthy once again. Upon returning to Metropolis, Superman, in his human identity of Clark Kent, is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance. While covering the launch of a space shuttle, he narrowly saves a plane carrying Lois and other observers from crashing after a mysterious power failure, an act that earns him much goodwill. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. | Clark tries to fix his relationship with Lois, but soon learns that she is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White (Frank Langella), with whom she shares a young, asthmatic son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). Luthor has his aide Kitty (Parker Posey) distract Superman, allowing Lex to steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Suspecting his involvement, Lois requests an off-the-record interview aboard his private yacht. Luthor admits that he is indeed responsible and reveals his true plan: to create a new continent modeled after Krypton that he can shape in his image, while triggering massive tsunamis that will wipe out the nations of the world and force humanity to turn to him for survival. Jason has an asthmatic attack when Luthor reveals the kryptonite, but has no subsequent reaction when Luthor holds the stone near him. | Jason is sitting by the piano and the Yacht starts to rock from the waves. When one of Luthor's henchmen threatens Lois, Jason pushes the piano towards the henchmen showing Lois that Jason is Superman's son. Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the new landmass emerges from the ocean. While working to contain the damage to Metropolis, Superman learns from Richard that Lois is in danger and saves her and Jason seconds before the yacht sinks. | Superman tries to apprehend Luthor, but the kryptonite-poisoned atmosphere quickly strips him of his powers. After letting his men beat him into submission, Luthor stabs Superman with a Kryptonite shard and leaves him to die. With Richard's help, Lois gets him to safety and removes the shard. Fueled by the sun's radiation, Superman defeats Luthor's gang and covers the landmass with soil, allowing him to safely throw it into space. While helping Luthor escape, a disillusioned Kitty allows the helicopter to crash on a remote island, trapping him. Complications from Kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove most of the fragments, they cannot revive him. Lois visits him and whispers something into his ear while glancing at Jason, after which Superman comes to. Acknowledging that he has a much greater responsibility than himself, he recalls Jor-El's (Marlon Brando) last speech to Jason as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled \"Why the World Needs Superman\". Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off into space, where he gazes down at the world.","m_cast":"Brandon Routh as Clark Kent / Superman: The Kryptonian superhero who disguises himself as a journalist. Stephan Bender portrays the teenage Clark Kent in a flashback scene. Director Singer believed only an unknown actor would be suitable for the part.[4] Routh was chosen from thousands of candidates interviewed at casting calls in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.[5] He had coincidentally auditioned for Clark Kent in the television series Smallville, but lost to Tom Welling. Routh had also met director Joseph \"McG\" Nichol for the role during pre-production of Superman: Flyby. Dana Reeve, wife of Christopher Reeve, believed Routh's physical resemblance to her late husband was striking.[6] To obtain the muscular physique to play Superman convincingly, Routh underwent a strict bodybuilding exercise regimen.[7] Prior to Routh's casting, Singer had X2 actor Daniel Cudmore audition.[8] | Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane: A reporter who works with Clark Kent at the Daily Planet, and former lover of Superman. Spacey recommended Singer to cast Bosworth in the role because she co-starred with Spacey in Beyond the Sea (2004) as Sandra Dee.[9] Claire Danes and Keri Russell were reportedly considered for the role.[10] Amy Adams, who would later be cast as Lois Lane in the 2013 reboot Man of Steel, confirmed in an interview that she had also auditioned for Lois in 2005. Adams had previously auditioned for Lois in 2003 when Brett Ratner was planning to direct Superman: Flyby.[11] Bosworth studied Katharine Hepburn's acting for inspiration, particularly in The Philadelphia Story (1940) and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967),[10] as well as Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich (2000).[12] | Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor: An evil sociopath armed with vast resources and an extensive knowledge of science who is Superman's nemesis. Because of his Academy Award-winning performance in Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), and friendship with the director, Spacey was the only actor considered for Lex Luthor. The writers specifically had Spacey in mind for the part when writing the script.[9] Spacey's version of Luthor has the same comically exaggerated vanity and pompous arrogance of the earlier Gene Hackman version as well as the same strong interest in real estate, but Spacey's version is far less campy and more serious. Spacey later said that director Singer told him to play the character as \"darker and more bitter\" compared to Hackman and not to use the earlier portrayal as an inspiration.[13] | James Marsden as Richard White: The nephew of the Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White and fiancé to Lois Lane. Marsden said Richard acts as an emotional challenge for Superman, since the hero comes back to find that \"Lois Lane picks somebody who's very Supermanesque\".[14] | Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski: Lex Luthor's henchwoman. She served as a prison nurse and would give Lex his examinations.[15] The character is based on Eve Teschmacher from the 1978 film, portrayed by Valerie Perrine.[16] Posey was the only actress considered for the role.[17] | Marlon Brando as Jor-El: Superman's biological father. Brando (who died in 2004) reprises his role from the 1978 film through the use of previous footage combined with computer-generated imagery. This required negotiations with Brando's estate for permission to have his footage used. Singer explained, \"We had access to all of the Brando footage that was shot. There was unused footage that had Brando reciting poems, trailing off subject and swearing like a sailor.\"[18] | Tristan Lake Leabu as Jason White: The son of Lois Lane and Superman. The question of whether Superman or Richard is Jason's father is initially unclear. He suffers from asthma and other ailments, but it is later revealed that he is the son of Superman, when he displays superhuman strength and discomfort around Kryptonite. | Other cast members include Frank Langella, who plays Daily Planet editor Perry White, a role originally attached to Hugh Laurie;[19] Sam Huntington as Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen, Eva Marie Saint as Clark Kent's adoptive mother Martha Kent, and Kal Penn as one of Luthor's henchmen, Stanford. Jack Larson, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman, makes a cameo appearance as a bartender. Noel Neill—who portrayed Lois Lane in the television series and the film serials Superman (1948) and Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) -- appears as Luthor's elderly wife Gertrude Vanderworth. Richard Branson cameos as the engineer aboard the space shuttle. Another of Luthor's henchmen (Riley) is played by former Australian Rugby League player Ian Roberts.[20]","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters appearing in comic books published  by DC Comics","m_directed_by":"Bryan Singer","m_produced_by":"Bryan Singer | Jon Peters | Gilbert Adler","m_screenplay_by":"Michael Dougherty | Dan Harris","m_story_by":"Bryan Singer | Michael Dougherty | Dan Harris","m_starring":"Brandon Routh | Kate Bosworth | Kevin Spacey | James Marsden | Frank Langella | Eva Marie Saint | Parker Posey | Kal Penn | Sam Huntington | Tristan Lake Leabu","m_music_by":"John Ottman","m_cinematography":"Newton Thomas Sigel","m_edited_by":"John Ottman | Elliot Graham","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

It is based on the DC Comics character Superman and serves as a homage sequel to the motion pictures Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980),[1][2] ignoring the events of Superman III (1983) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987).[1] The film stars Brandon Routh as Clark Kent/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, with James Marsden, Frank Langella, and Parker Posey. The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme that will destroy Superman and the world. | After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Superman on the screen, Warner Bros. hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop Superman Returns in July 2004. The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia, Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Rhythm & Hues, Framestore, Rising Sun Pictures, and The Orphanage;[3] filming ended in November 2005. | Superman Returns received positive reviews, with critics praising its story, visual effects, and style. However, it received mixed reviews from audiences, who criticized the film for its length, the story, and lack of action sequences. Warner Bros. was also disappointed with the worldwide box office return. A sequel was planned for a summer 2009 release, but the project was later canceled. The Superman film series was rebooted in 2013 with the film Man of Steel, directed by Zack Snyder and starring Henry Cavill as Superman. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":" | ^ a b Chattaway, Peter (June 28, 2006). \"Superman Returns\".
