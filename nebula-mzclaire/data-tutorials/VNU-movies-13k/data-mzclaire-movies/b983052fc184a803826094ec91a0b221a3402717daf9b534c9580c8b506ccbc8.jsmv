Among the most enthusiastic was Roger Ebert, who included the film in his list of the best ten documentaries of 2009 and who wrote, \"What's interesting is that every single person in this film is seen as themselves, is allowed to speak and seems to have a good heart.

What’s the Matter With Kansas? depicts a groundswell of anger but largely ignores the external forces that helped shape it.[4] Kyle Smith wrote in The New York Post that \"It’s condescending, it’s vague, it’s unfair and, ultimately, it’s pointless.\"[5]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"What's the Matter with Kansas  by Thomas Frank","m_directed_by":"Joe Winston","m_produced_by":"Laura Cohen Joe Winston","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"T.W.
