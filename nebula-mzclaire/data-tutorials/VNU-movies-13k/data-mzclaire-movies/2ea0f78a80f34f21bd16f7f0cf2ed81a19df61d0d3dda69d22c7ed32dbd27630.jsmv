{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"With much of the rest of the world at war, a number of bored British aristocrats live dissolute and hedonistic lives in a region of British Kenya known as Happy Valley, drinking, drugging and indulging in decadent sexual affairs to pass the time. | On 24 January 1941, Josslyn Hay, the philandering Earl of Erroll, is found dead in his car in a remote location. The Earl has a noble pedigree but a somewhat sordid past and a well-deserved reputation for having affairs with married women. | Diana Delves Broughton is one such woman. She is the beautiful wife of Sir John Henry Delves Broughton, known to most as \"Jock,\" a man 30 years her senior. Diana has a pre-nuptial understanding with her husband that should either of them fall in love with someone else, the other will do nothing to impede the romance. | Diana has indeed succumbed to the charms of the roguish Earl of Erroll, whose other lovers also include the drug-addicted American heiress Alice de Janze and the somewhat more reserved Nina Soames. The Earl is more serious about this affair than any of his earlier dalliances, and wants Diana to marry him. She is reluctant to leave what she thinks is the financial security of her marriage to formalise her relationship Erroll, who has no funds or prospects, unaware that Delves Broughton is deep in debt. Privately humiliated but appearing to honour their agreement, Delves Broughton publicly toasts the couple's affair at the club in Nairobi, asking Erroll to bring Diana home at a specified time. Delves Broughton appears to be extremely intoxicated for the rest of the evening; once he is alone it is clear he was feigning drunkenness. After dropping off Diana, Erroll is shot to death in his car not far from the home of Delves Broughton who is soon charged with Errol's murder. | Diana is distraught over losing her lover, as is Alice, who openly masturbates next to his corpse at the mortuary. A local plantation owner, Gilbert Colvile, whose only friend is Delves Broughton, quietly offers Diana advice and solace and ultimately shocks her by proposing marriage. | Delves Broughton stands trial. There are no witnesses to the crime and the physical evidence that appears incriminating is also circumstantial. He obviously had the motive and means, but is found innocent and the scandal comes to an end. De Janze is dying of a drug overdose, and Diana discovering further evidence that implicates her husband in her lover's death. After menacing her with a shotgun, Broughton shoots himself in front of her. The film ends with a fleeing, bloodstained Diana discovering the remaining Happy Valley set partying around de Janze's grave.","m_cast":"Greta Scacchi as Diana Broughton | Joss Ackland as Sir Henry \"Jock\" Delves Broughton, 11th Baronet | Charles Dance as Josslyn Hay, Earl of Erroll | Sarah Miles as Alice de Janzé | Geraldine Chaplin as Nina Soames | Ray McAnally as Morris | Murray Head as Lizzie | John Hurt as Gilbert Colvile | Trevor Howard as Jack Soames | Susan Fleetwood as Gwladys Delamere | Catherine Neilson as June Carbery | Hugh Grant as Hugh Dickinson | Alan Dobie as Sir Walter Harragin | Jacqueline Pearce as Idina Soltau","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Obtaining funding for the film was difficult and only achieved when David Puttnam became head of Columbia and agreed to provide the balance.[1] The film made a loss during its theatrical release.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"White Mischief  by James Fox","m_directed_by":"Michael Radford","m_produced_by":"Simon Perry","m_screenplay_by":"Michael Radford Jonathan Gems","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Greta Scacchi | Charles Dance | Joss Ackland | Sarah Miles | Geraldine Chaplin | Ray McAnally | Murray Head | John Hurt | Trevor Howard","m_music_by":"George Fenton","m_cinematography":"Roger Deakins","m_edited_by":"Tom Priestley","m_production_company":"Nelson Entertainment Goldcrest Films BBC","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"22 April 1988","m_running_time":"107 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£8 million[1]","m_box_office":"$3,107,551 (US) £1,532,903 (UK)[2] | White Mischief is a 1988 film dramatising the events of the Happy Valley murder case in Kenya in 1941, when Sir Henry \"Jock\" Delves Broughton was tried for the murder of Josslyn Hay, Earl of Erroll. | Based on a book by the Sunday Times journalist James Fox (originally researched with Cyril Connolly for an article in December 1969),[3] it was directed by Michael Radford. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Power, James. \"Requiem for a shooting party.\" Sunday Times [London, England] 12 Apr. 1987: 51.
