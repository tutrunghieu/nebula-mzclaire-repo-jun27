{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Peter Parker struggles to balance his crime-fighting duties as Spider-Man with the demands of his normal life. Estranged from both love interest Mary Jane Watson and best friend Harry Osborn, Peter additionally discovers his Aunt May is facing foreclosure. | Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, sponsors the brilliant nuclear scientist Otto Octavius' fusion power project. While handling the equipment, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. In a demonstration, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical, killing his wife and damaging his robotic arms; in the process, the inhibitor chip controlling the arms is rendered useless. Spider-Man arrives and shuts down the experiment, destroying it in a massive explosion before it can do any further damage. | At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius's harness. However, after the inhibitor chip is destroyed, the arms have developed sentience. They spring to life and attack the medical crew, killing most of them. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and hides at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, Octavius robs a bank to fund another experiment. When Spider-Man is attempting to save Aunt May, Octavius is upset because he stuck his webs in his business once again. The Daily Bugle subsequently dubs him Doctor Octopus. | Mary Jane becomes engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown and temporarily loses his powers. He abandons his Spider-Man identity, returns to his normal life and tries to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Spider-Man's costume to J. Jonah Jameson, who takes credit for Spider-Man's disappearance. Peter tells Aunt May that his Uncle Ben's death some time ago was his fault. May forgives him, but the rise in New York City crime rate worries Peter. | Octavius needs tritium to fuel his reactor and goes to Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man's life. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who is supposedly good friends with Spider-Man. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Peter's powers are restored, and he steals back his costume from the Bugle and goes after Octavius. | As Spider-Man battles Octavius, they fall onto a rapid transit R train. Octavius sabotages the controls and jumps off, and Spider-Man struggles to stop the train before the track ends. When he faints from exhaustion, the passengers carry him into one of the cars. He comes to and realizes his mask is off, but the passengers promise not to reveal his identity. Octavius returns, easily subdues Spider-Man, and delivers him to Harry. | After giving Octavius the Tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Saying greater things are at stake, he convinces Harry to reveal Octavius's location. Spider-Man arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and tries to rescue Mary Jane discreetly. One of Octavius's tentacles senses him, and they fight. Spider-Man ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let go of his dream for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him and drowns the fusion reactor, along with himself, in the Hudson River. Mary Jane discovers Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, as well as why they cannot be together. Spider-Man returns Mary Jane to John and leaves. | Harry is visited by a vision of his father, pleading for Harry to avenge his death. Refusing to hurt Peter, Harry shatters the mirror, unintentionally revealing a secret room containing the Green Goblin's equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. After they kiss, they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him to respond as Spider-Man.","m_cast":"Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man | Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson | James Franco as Harry Osborn | Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus / Doc Ock | Rosemary Harris as May Parker | J.K.

Worldwide, the film grossed $783.7 million, ranking as 2004's third highest-grossing film behind Shrek 2 and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Spider-Man 2 is the twenty-eighth highest grossing film in the U.S. and Canada.[2] The film sold an estimated 60,158,700 tickets in the US.[34] | Based on 261 reviews collected by the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Spider-Man 2 has a 93% overall approval rating from critics, with an average score of 8.3 out of 10. The site's consensus states \"Boasting an entertaining villain and deeper emotional focus, this is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original\".[35] By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 83, based on 41 reviews.[36] The film was placed at No. 411 on Empire magazine's top 500 movies list.[37] | Chicago Tribune's Mark Caro stated that Alfred Molina was a \"pleasingly complex\" villain, and the film as a whole \"improves upon its predecessor in almost every way.\"[38] Kenneth Turan, of the Los Angeles Times, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and concurred with Caro when he stated, \"Doc Ock grabs this film with his quartet of sinisterly serpentine mechanical arms and refuses to let go.\"[39] Roger Ebert, who had given the first film two and a half stars, gave Spider-Man 2 a perfect four out of four stars, calling it \"The best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with Superman (1978)\", and praising the film for \"effortlessly [combining] special effects and a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving.\"[40] He later called it the fourth best film of 2004.\"[41] IGN's Richard George felt \"Sam Raimi and his writing team delivered an iconic, compelling version of Spider-Man's classic foe... We almost wish there was a way to retroactively add some of these elements to the original character.\"[42] | Conversely, J. Hoberman, of The Village Voice, thought the first half of the film was \"talky bordering on tiresome\", with the film often stopping to showcase Raimi's idea of humor.[43] Charles Taylor believed, \"The script's miscalculation of Peter's decision feeds into the pedestrian quality of Raimi's direction and into Maguire's weightlessness... [Maguire] simply does not suggest a heroic presence\", and suggested that \"Dunst appears to be chafing against strictures she cannot articulate.\"[44] | Spider-Man 2 won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Sound Mixing (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell, Jeffrey J. Haboush and Joseph Geisinger) and Best Sound Editing, but lost to Ray and The Incredibles, respectively.[45] The film won Saturn Awards for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Fantasy Film, Best Special Effects, and Best Writer, while being nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Music.[46] It was nominated for two British Academy Film Awards for Special Visual Effects and Sound, but lost to The Day After Tomorrow and Ray, respectively.[47] The AFI listed the film as one of the 2004's ten best films,[48] and nominated it for positions on the lists of the top 10 fantasy films,[49] the 100 most inspiring American films,[50] and the 100 greatest American films.[51]","m_production":"Immediately after finishing Spider-Man, director Sam Raimi with help from James Keltie segued into directing a sequel.[8] In April 2002, Sony hired Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to write a script with Doctor Octopus, the Lizard and Black Cat as villains.[4] On May 8, 2002, following Spider-Man's record breaking $115 million opening weekend, Sony Pictures announced a sequel for 2004.[14] Entitled The Amazing Spider-Man, after the character's main comic book title,[15] the film was given a budget of $200 million[16] and aimed for a release date of May 7, 2004. The following month, David Koepp was added to co-write with Gough and Millar.[4] | In September 2002, Michael Chabon was hired to rewrite.[4] His draft had a younger Doc Ock, who becomes infatuated with Mary Jane. His mechanical limbs use endorphins to counteract the pain of being attached to his body, which he enjoys. When he injures two muggers on a date, this horrifies Mary Jane and in the resulting battle with Spider-Man his tentacles are fused together, and the fusion begins to kill him. In the script, Octavius is the creator of the genetically-altered spider from the first film, and gives Peter an antidote to remove his powers: this means when Octavius is dying with his tentacles, he wants to extract Spider-Man's spine to save himself. This leads to the alliance with Harry in the final film. Beforehand, Harry and the Daily Bugle put a $10 million price on Spider-Man's head, causing the city's citizens to turn against him.[17] Producer Avi Arad rejected the love triangle angle on Ock, and found Harry putting a price on Spider-Man's head unsubtle.[8] | Raimi sifted through the previous drafts by Gough, Millar, Koepp and Chabon, picking what he liked with screenwriter Alvin Sargent.[18] He felt that thematically the film had to explore Peter's conflict with his personal wants against his responsibility, exploring the positive and negatives of his chosen path, and how he ultimately decides that he can be happy as a heroic figure.[8] Raimi stated the story was partly influenced by Superman II, which also explored the titular hero giving up his responsibilities.[19] The story is mainly taken from The Amazing Spider-Man No. 50, \"Spider-Man No More!\" It was decided that Doc Ock would be kept as the villain, as he was both a visually interesting villain who was a physical match for Spider-Man, and a sympathetic figure with humanity.[8] Raimi changed much of the character's backstory, however, adding the idea of Otto Octavius being a hero of Peter, and how their conflict was about trying to rescue him from his demons rather than kill him.[15] | Spider-Man 2 was shot on over one hundred sets and locations, beginning with a pre-shoot on the Loop in Chicago during two days in November 2002. The crew bought a carriage, placing sixteen cameras for background shots of Spider-Man and Doc Ock's train fight.[8] Principal photography began on April 12, 2003 in New York City. The crew moved on May 13 to Los Angeles,[4] shooting on ten major sets created by production designer Neil Spisak. After the scare surrounding his back pains, Tobey Maguire relished performing many of his stunts, even creating a joke of it with Raimi, creating the line \"My back, my back\" as Spider-Man tries to regain his powers.[18] Even Rosemary Harris took a turn, putting her stunt double out of work. In contrast, Alfred Molina joked that the stunt team would \"trick\" him into performing a stunt time and again.[8] | Filming was put on hiatus for eight weeks, in order to build Doc Ock's pier lair. It had been Spisak's idea to use a collapsed pier as Ock's lair, reflecting an exploded version of the previous lab and representing how Octavius' life had collapsed and grown more monstrous,[8] evoking the cinema of Fritz Lang and the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.[20] Filming then resumed on that set, having taken fifteen weeks to build, occupying Sony's Stage 30. It was 60 feet (18 m) by 120 feet (37 m) long, and 40 feet (12 m) high, and a quarter-scale miniature was also built for the finale as it collapses.[8] Filming was still going after Christmas 2003.[21] | A camera system called the Spydercam was used to allow filmmakers to express more of Spider-Man's world view, at times dropping fifty stories and with shot lengths of just over 2,400 feet (730 m) in New York or 3,200 feet (980 m) in Los Angeles. For some shots the camera would shoot at six frames per second for a faster playback increasing the sense of speed. Shots using the Spydercam were pre-planned in digital versions of cities, and the camera's movement was controlled with motion control, making it highly cost-effective. The camera system was only used in the previous film for the final shot.[8] | Although roughly the same, costume designer James Acheson made numerous subtle changes to Spider-Man's costume. The colors were made richer and bolder, the spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, the eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and the muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement. The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eye pieces, which were easier to remove.[8] | To create Doctor Octopus' mechanical tentacles, Edge FX was hired to create a corset, a metal and rubber girdle, a rubber spine and four foam rubber tentacles which were 8 feet (2.4 m) long, which altogether weighed 100 pounds (45 kg). The claws of each tentacle, which were dubbed \"death flowers\", were controlled by a single puppeteer in a chair, to control every available form on the claw. Each tentacle was controlled by four people, who rehearsed every scene with Molina to give a natural sense of movement as if the tentacles were moving due to Octavius' muscle movement.[22] On-set, Molina christened his co-stars \"Larry\", \"Harry\", \"Moe\" and \"Flo\", with \"Flo\" being the top-right tentacle.[23] | Edge FX was only hired to do scenes where Octavius carries his tentacles. CGI was used for when the tentacles carry Octavius: a 20 ft (6.1 m) high rig held Molina to glide through his surroundings, with CG tentacles added later.[22] The CG versions were scanned straight from the practical ones.[8] However, using the practical versions was always preferred to save money,[22] and each scene was always filmed first with Edge FX's creations to see if CGI was truly necessary. Completing the illusion, the sound designers chose not to use servo sound effects, feeling it would rob the tentacles of the sense that they were part of Octavius' body, and instead used motorcycle chains and piano wires.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Amazing Spider-Man  by Stan Lee Steve Ditko","m_directed_by":"Sam Raimi","m_produced_by":"Avi Arad | Laura Ziskin","m_screenplay_by":"Alvin Sargent","m_story_by":"Alfred Gough | Miles Millar | Michael Chabon","m_starring":"Tobey Maguire | Kirsten Dunst | James Franco | Alfred Molina | Rosemary Harris | Donna Murphy","m_music_by":"Danny Elfman","m_cinematography":"Bill Pope","m_edited_by":"Bob Murawski","m_production_company":"Marvel Enterprises","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"June 25, 2004 (2004-06-25) (Lithuania) | June 30, 2004 (2004-06-30) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"127 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$200 million[2]","m_box_office":"$783.8 million[2] | Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Michael Chabon.
