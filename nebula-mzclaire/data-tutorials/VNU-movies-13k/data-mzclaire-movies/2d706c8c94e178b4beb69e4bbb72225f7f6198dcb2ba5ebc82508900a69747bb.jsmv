{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Bristol, England | The Wallace and Gromit films are shot using the stop motion animation technique.[23] After detailed storyboarding, set and plasticine model construction, the films are shot one frame at a time, moving the models of the characters slightly to give the impression of movement in the final film. In common with other animation techniques, the stop motion animation in Wallace and Gromit may duplicate frames if there is little motion, and in action scenes sometimes multiple exposures per frame are used to produce a faux motion blur. Because a second of film constitutes 24 separate frames, even a short half-hour film like A Close Shave takes a great deal of time to animate. General quotes on the speed of animation of a Wallace and Gromit film put the filming rate at typically around 30 frames per day — i.e. just over one second of film is photographed for each day of production.[dubious – discuss]. The feature-length The Curse of the Were-Rabbit took 15 months to make. | Some effects, particularly the fire, smoke, and floating bunnies in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, proved impossible to create in stop motion and were rendered by computer animation specialists, MPC film.[24] | Most models were destroyed in the 2005 Aardman studio fire, but a set from A Matter of Loaf and Death is presently on display at the At-Bristol science centre.[25] | The music featured in every film was written by Julian Nott, a British film composer. | The theme song was used to wake up astronauts aboard space shuttle mission STS-132 in May 2010.[26] It has been suggested on BBC Radio 4's PM that the theme should become the England football supporters' song, instead of the main title theme of The Great Escape.[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":null,"m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"English | 4 30-minute films | 1 feature film | 1 6-part TV series | 10 2-minute shorts | 1 BBC Proms special","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Andy MacCormack | Dave Alex Riddett","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":"Official Site | Wallace and Gromit is a British clay animation comedy series created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations. The series consists of four short films and a feature-length film. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric cheese loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic dog. Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, but as of 2011, this role has been passed on to Ben Whitehead. Gromit has no mouth and remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language. | Because of their widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international icons of both modern British culture in particular and British people in general. BBC News has called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\".[1] Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\".[2] Wallace and Gromit has been translated into over 20 languages and has a particularly big following in Japan, as well as in its native Britain and across Europe and the United States. | In 2015, a Wallace and Gromit experience opened at Land's End. The Land's End signpost will be rebranded \"Lamb's End\" with original sets, models and characters from a range of Aardman productions. Visitors can star in a real Shaun the Sheep scene, using green screen technology, and meet other characters from the Aardman family, including Shaun The Sheep and Morph.[3] |  | ","m_country":null,"m_language":null,"m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Wallace and Gromit's cracking careers.
