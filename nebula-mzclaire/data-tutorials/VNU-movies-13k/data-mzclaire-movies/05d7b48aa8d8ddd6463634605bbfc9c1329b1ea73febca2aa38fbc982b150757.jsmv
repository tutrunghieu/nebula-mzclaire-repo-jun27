It was named one of the Ten Best Films of 1976 by the National Board of Review, along with Rocky, All the President's Men, and Network. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times ranked The Shootist #10 on his list of the 10 best films of 1976.[10] The film was nominated for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA film award, and a Writers Guild of America award. The film currently has a 93% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.[11]","m_production":"The character of J. B. Books foreshadows the final days of John Wayne, who had already lost a lung and several ribs to lung cancer and would ultimately die from stomach cancer three years after production ended. The Shootist would be his final film role, concluding a legendary career that began during the silent film era in 1926. Lauren Bacall had suffered through the 1957 death of her husband Humphrey Bogart, who died of throat cancer, adding further shading to the film's parallels. | At the time that the movie rights were purchased, John Wayne was not seriously considered for the role due to questions about his health and his ability to complete the filming. The producers had wanted George C. Scott, but Wayne actively campaigned for the role and made completion of the film a personal mission. | Contrary to popular belief, John Wayne was not facing a diagnosis of terminal cancer when the film was made, although as a life-long six-pack-a-day smoker, as well as having been exposed to radiation during nuclear tests while making The Conqueror, it seems he suspected his life would follow that of character J.B. Books and was determined to be in the film.[5] Following his previous diagnosis of lung cancer in 1964, his entire left lung and several ribs had been surgically removed, and in 1969 he was declared to be \"cured\" (an overly-optimistic prognosis for lung cancer that today would likely be called a temporary remission instead). It was not until a decade later that the cancer was found to have returned for good—in 1979, almost three years after this movie had been filmed. This time the disease spread to his stomach, intestines, and spine. | The film was shot on location in Carson City, Nevada and at the Warner Brothers Burbank Studios in California. In Carson City, the Krebs-Peterson House at 500 Mountain Street was used for the widow Bond Rogers rooming house, where J. B. Books stayed.[6] The house is located three doors south of the Nevada governor's mansion. The only change to the house was a portico added on the southern side. Scenes were also shot at Washoe Lake State Park at 4855 Eastlake Boulevard in Carson City.[6] | John Wayne was responsible for a number of changes in the final film. He changed the location from El Paso to Carson City, and also had his horse Dollar written in. More significantly, Wayne also changed the ending of the screenplay. Books was supposed to shoot Jack Pulford in the back, and then Gillom Rogers was to shoot Books. Wayne said, \"Mister, I've made over 250 pictures and have never shot a guy in the back. Change it.\" He also did not want the young Gillom killing him; this would have made the movie go in a different direction and Gillom's tossing away of the gun, thus rejecting the life of a gunman, gained Wayne's approval. | Wayne was also responsible for much of the film's casting of friends and past co-stars. Lauren Bacall, James Stewart, Richard Boone, and John Carradine were all cast at Wayne's request. | Despite Wayne's influence on the film, Don Siegel denied claims that he and Wayne clashed, saying that \"He had plenty of his own ideas... and some I liked which gave me inspirations, and some I didn't like. But we didn't fight over any of it. We liked each other and respected each other.\"[7] | The horse that J. B. Books rides in the film and gives to Gillom — Dollar (Ol' Dollar) - had been Wayne's favorite horse for ten years, through several Westerns. The horse shown during the final scene of True Grit was Dollar, a two-year-old in 1969. Wayne had Dollar, a chestnut quarter horse gelding, written into the script (although there is no mention in the book of a specific horse), because of his love for the horse; it was a condition for him working on the project. Wayne would not let anyone else ride him. Robert Wagner rode the horse in a segment of the Hart to Hart television show, but this was after Wayne's death.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Shootist  by Glendon Swarthout","m_directed_by":"Don Siegel","m_produced_by":"M.J.

Many speculate that he was reluctant to choose another film in the three years left to him because this was such a perfect closing film for him. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Box Office Information for The Shootist.
