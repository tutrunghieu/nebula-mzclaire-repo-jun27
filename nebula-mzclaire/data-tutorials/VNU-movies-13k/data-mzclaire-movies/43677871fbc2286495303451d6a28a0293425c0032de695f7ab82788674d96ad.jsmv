Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 55% rating, based on 130 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though solidly made and acted, The Shipping News is rather heavy-handed and dull, especially given the nature of its protagonist.\"[2] At Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[3]","m_production":"The film, while broadly following the plot of the book, makes several changes, notably: Quoyle was obese and had two daughters in the novel, but only one in the film. He's only a timid ink setter in the film and he does not begin writing as a brave reporter until after arriving in Newfoundland. Another difference is that several characters, such as the younger Buggit family, were deleted or merged. | The film was originally to be directed by Fred Schepisi, with John Travolta in lead male role.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Shipping News  by Annie Proulx","m_directed_by":"Lasse Hallström","m_produced_by":"Rob Cowan Leslie Holleran Irwin J.
