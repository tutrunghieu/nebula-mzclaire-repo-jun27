{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Under the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. Paul Latour is a prisoner of war in Germany and his wife Marie lives hand-to-mouth with their two children in a squalid flat. A neighbour, whose husband is also in Germany, has fallen pregnant and is trying to lose the baby. Marie helps her, successfully. Other women come to her and she starts charging. While talking with Paul one night, she reveals that a fortune teller saw \"nothing but good things\" in her future, along with a lot of women, which she wouldn't clarify, but alluded to her abortion activities. Marie also confessed to wanting to be a famous singer. | Despite her husbands return, she will not resume relations. She sees him as immasculated, and less than a man. Although he cannot find work, he rents a bigger flat so that the two can have some privacy. Marie not only has more space for her illicit business but lets a prostitute use a room during the day. She also starts a daytime affair with a collaborator. | When one of the abortions goes wrong, the woman dies and her despairing husband commits suicide. Marie shrugs off the tragedy and hires a maid to help, suggesting that part of her duties can be to sleep with Paul. After returning home early and witnessing Marie and her lover asleep together, he sends an anonymous denunciation to the police, alerting them of her illegal activities. | A recent law of the Vichy régime, determined to enforce morality and stop population decline, has made abortion a treasonable crime. Marie is condemned to death and guillotined. Before being arrested, she visits a music teacher, who tells her that she was a great voice, fulfilling both prophecies of the fortune teller.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Claude Chabrol","m_produced_by":"Marin Karmitz","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Isabelle Huppert François Cluzet Nils Tavernier","m_music_by":"Matthieu Chabrol.
