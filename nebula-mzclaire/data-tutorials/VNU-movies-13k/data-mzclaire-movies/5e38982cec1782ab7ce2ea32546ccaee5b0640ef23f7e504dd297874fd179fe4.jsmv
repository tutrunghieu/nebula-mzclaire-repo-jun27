{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Catherine Sloper (Olivia de Havilland) is a plain, painfully shy woman whose emotionally detached father (Ralph Richardson) makes no secret of his disappointment in her. He is terribly bitter about the loss of his charming and beautiful wife, whom he feels fate replaced with a simple and unalluring daughter. Catherine is, however, innocent enough not to completely understand her father's disdain. When she meets the charming Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), she immediately is taken by the attention that he lavishes upon her, attention she so desperately seeks from her father. Catherine falls madly in love with Morris and they plan to marry. | Catherine's father believes Morris is courting Catherine only to get her inheritance and threatens to disinherit her if she marries him. Catherine does not care, and plans to elope with Morris but not before telling him about her father's decision. On the night they are to elope, Catherine eagerly waits at home for Morris to come and take her away, but he never arrives. | Catherine is heartbroken. A day or so later, she has a bitter argument with her father, who reveals he is dying. She tells her father she still loves Morris and challenges him to change his will if he is afraid of how she will spend his money after he dies. He does not and dies a short time later, leaving her his entire estate. | A few years later, Morris returns from California, having made nothing of himself and eyeing the Slopers' luxurious house with more obvious eagerness. Again he professes his love for Catherine, claiming that he left her behind because he could not bear to see her destitute. Catherine pretends to forgive him and tells him she still wants to elope as they originally planned. He promises to come back that night for her, and she tells him she will start packing her bags. | When Morris returns, Catherine takes her revenge. Her aunt asks her how she can be so cruel, and she responds, \"I have been taught by masters.\" She calmly orders the maid to bolt the door, leaving Morris locked outside, shouting her name. The film fades out with Catherine silently ascending the stairs while Morris' despairing cries echo unanswered through the darkness.","m_cast":"Olivia de Havilland as Catherine Sloper | Montgomery Clift as Morris Townsend | Ralph Richardson as Dr. Austin Sloper | Miriam Hopkins as Lavinia Penniman | Vanessa Brown as Maria | Betty Linley as Mrs. Montgomery | Ray Collins as Jefferson Almond | Mona Freeman as Marian Almond | Selena Royle as Elizabeth Almond | Paul Lees as Arthur Townsend | Harry Antrim as Mr. Abeel | Russ Conway as Quintus | David Thursby as Geier","m_reception":"The Heiress received universal critical acclaim and won four Academy Awards. In his review in the New York Times, Bosley Crowther said the film \"crackles with allusive life and fire in its tender and agonized telling of an extraordinarily characterful tale\" and added, \"Mr. Wyler . . . has given this somewhat austere drama an absorbing intimacy and a warming illusion of nearness that it did not have on the stage. He has brought the full-bodied people very closely and vividly to view, while maintaining the clarity and sharpness of their personalities, their emotions and their styles . . . The Heiress is one of the handsome, intense and adult dramas of the year.\"[5] | TV Guide rates the film five out of a possible five stars and adds, \"This powerful and compelling drama . . . owes its triumph to the deft hand of director William Wyler and a remarkable lead performance by Olivia de Havilland.[6] | Time Out London calls the film \"typically plush, painstaking and cold. . . . highly professional and heartless.\"[7] | Channel 4 says of the performances, \"de Havilland's portrayal . . . is spine-chilling . . . Clift brings a subtle ambiguity to one of his least interesting roles, and Richardson is also excellent.\"[8]","m_production":"After seeing The Heiress on Broadway, Olivia de Havilland approached William Wyler about directing her in a screen adaptation of the play. He agreed and encouraged Paramount Pictures executives to purchase the rights from the playwrights (Ruth and Augustus Goetz) for $250,000 and offer them $10,000 per week to write the screenplay. The couple were asked to make Morris less of a villain than he was in their play and the original novel in deference to the studio's desire to capitalize on Montgomery Clift's reputation as a romantic leading man.[4] | The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. | Ralph Richardson reprised the role of Austin Sloper he originated in the London production of the play. | There also was a film called Washington Square in 1997 which was not based on the play, but based directly on the Henry James novel that the play was suggested by.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Heiress  by Ruth and Augustus Goetz","m_directed_by":"William Wyler","m_produced_by":"William Wyler","m_screenplay_by":"Ruth and Augustus Goetz","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Olivia de Havilland | Montgomery Clift | Ralph Richardson","m_music_by":"Aaron Copland","m_cinematography":"Leo Tover","m_edited_by":"William Hornbeck","m_production_company":"Paramount Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 6, 1949 (1949-10-06) (USA) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"115 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$2.6 million","m_box_office":"$2.3 million (US rentals)[1] | The Heiress is a 1949 American drama film directed by William Wyler and starring Olivia de Havilland as Catherine Sloper, Montgomery Clift as Morris Townsend, and Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper.
