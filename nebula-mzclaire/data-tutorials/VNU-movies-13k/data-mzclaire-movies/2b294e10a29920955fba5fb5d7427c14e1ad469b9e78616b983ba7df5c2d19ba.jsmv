He sold the rights to this and two others to Earl St John of Rank Film Productions. The script was rewritten and 'Anglicized' by Anthony Perry. Perry's draft was considered too \"political\" and was rewritten by Jill Craigie to be softened. However the resulting work was considerably more left wing than Rank's other colonial war films of this time such as The Planter's Wife and Simba.[2] | Ronald Neame had just left The Seventh Sin (1957) during production. He was contacted by his old producing partner John Bryan who suggested Neame make Windom's Way with Peter Finch. | \"It was not a successful picture, I'm afraid,\" said Neame later. \"I think it fell between two stools, neither politically profound nor exciting enough as an action film. John just liked the book very much and I would have directed anything to get back to the studios again.\"[3] | Finch made the film immediately after returning from Australia where he made Robbery Under Arms. Part of the location shoot took place in Corsica.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"novel by James Ramsey Ullman","m_directed_by":"Ronald Neame","m_produced_by":"John Bryan John Hawkesworth executive Earl St. John","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Finch","m_music_by":"James Bernard","m_cinematography":"Christopher Challis","m_edited_by":"Reginald Mills","m_production_company":"Rank Organisation","m_distributed_by":"Rank","m_release_dates":"December 1957","m_running_time":"108 min.","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | Windom's Way is a 1957 British thriller film directed by Ronald Neame set during the Malayan Emergency.
