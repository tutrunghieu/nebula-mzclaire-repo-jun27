{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Arriving in Seattle, Washington, writer Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes) secures a job at Pique magazine and lodging in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester (Kurtwood Smith and Gwynyth Walsh). The handsome Nick soon makes the acquaintance of the Forrester's 14-year-old daughter Adrienne (Alicia Silverstone), a precocious girl who develops an intense attraction to him. She secretly helps Nick by sneaking into his room and rewriting one of his Pique stories, which subsequently wins a rave from his editor/boss, Michael (Matthew Walker). At a party thrown by the Forresters, Nick agrees to accompany the lonely girl on a nighttime drive to a romantic spot, where she kisses him. | This intensifies Adrienne's crush on Nick, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off, having begun a budding romance with coworker Amy (Jennifer Rubin). Adrienne continues to boldly pursue him, even going so far as to undress in his view while he is hiding in her closet. Nick, however, continues to rebuff her advances, and Adrienne's actions become destructive. She defaces a car he's restored and erases his computer discs, yet he's unable to convince Cliff and Liv of what's going on. Cheyenne (Amber Benson), a friend of Adrienne who tries to warn Nick about her, meets with an \"accident\" at the riding school they attend together. After Adrienne spies on Nick in bed with Amy, she locks Amy in her darkroom and empties a wasps' nest into the vents. Amy survives, and Nick, now convinced that Adrienne is big trouble, attempts to find new lodging. However, Adrienne manages to sabotage his efforts. She accuses him of sexually assaulting her with \"evidence\" obtained from a used condom from Nick's trash, leading to his arrest. After Michael bails him out (and fires him), Nick is met once again by Cheyenne. She informs Nick that she knows he did not do anything to Adrienne, and that Adrienne had behaved like this before to a previous crush, a camp counselor named Rick who \"accidentally\" died by eating something poisonous. Cheyenne also informs Nick of a diary Adrienne kept that can exonerate him. | When Cheyenne leaves, Nick goes looking for her when he hears strange noises from the Forresters' house. He discovers Cheyenne bound and gagged in the attic, and is confronted by Adrienne and then an amazed Cliff, who attacks him thinking he is the enemy. Adrienne, still infatuated, attacks her father, leaving Nick free to subdue her with one punch. Acquitted, Nick goes to live with Amy while Adrienne, confined to a psychiatric hospital, wishes to express her remorse for what she has done to Nick. Her doctor comments that she is making good progress, unaware she is developing a crush on him now. | Ultimately, she returns to her room in the psychiatric hospital, where she looks at her doctor's wedding photo with an evil glare.","m_cast":"Cary Elwes as Nicholas \"Nick\" Eliot | Alicia Silverstone as Adrienne Forrester | Jennifer Rubin as Amy Maddik | Kurtwood Smith as Cliff Forrester | Gwynyth Walsh as Liv Forrester | Amber Benson as Cheyenne | Matthew Walker as Michael","m_reception":"The film was panned by critics.
