{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During the Great depression in 1933 in Winnipeg, Canada, baroness Helen Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) announces a competition to find the saddest music in the world, as a publicity stunt to promote her company, Muskeg Beer, as Prohibition is about to end in the United States. The prize is $25,000 \"Depression-era dollars\" and musicians from all over the world pour into Winnipeg to compete. Chester Kent (Mark McKinney), a failing Broadway producer, decides to enter the contest representing America, even though he is Canadian and originally from Winnipeg. An old fortune teller predicts his doom, but Chester mocks this prediction by having his nymphomaniac amnesiac girlfriend Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) masturbate him. Also entering the contest are Chester's father Fyodor (David Fox), representing Canada, and his brother Roderick (Ross McMillan), representing Serbia as \"Gavrilo the Great\" (even though he is also Canadian). | It is revealed that Fyodor is in love with Helen, who he had once hoped to marry. However, Helen and Chester had an affair, and an accident involving the three occurred when Fyodor stepped out in front of Chester's car as Helen was performing oral sex on Chester. Helen's legs were both amputated as a result, and Fyodor became an alcoholic, while Chester left for Broadway. With Chester returned, and his relationship with Helen renewed, Fyodor swears off drink and fashions prosthetic legs filled with beer in an attempt to earn Helen's love. | Roderick meanwhile discovers that Chester's girlfriend Narcissa is his missing wife, who has forgotten both their marriage and their son after the boy's death (Roderick carries the boy's heart in a jar, preserved in his own tears). Helen rigs the contest to favour Chester/America, and Fyodor/Canada quickly loses after singing \"Red Maples Leaves,\" although Roderick/Serbia advances. Although Roderick and Narcissa have sex, she still doesn't remember their marriage, and he accidentally breaks the jar containing his son's heart (which is pierced by a glass shard), and although Helen loves her new glass beer legs, she still hates Fyodor. Fyodor then drinks a leg's worth of beer and falls through the concert hall rooftop to his death. | Helen appears in Chester's final performance, but her legs leak and explode when Roderick plays. Roderick then changes his tune to play \"The Song Is You,\" which he had sworn not to perform until reunited with his wife. The song recovers Narcissa's memory and Chester, meanwhile, is stabbed to death by Helen (using a long shard from her glass legs). Chester refuses to let this sadden him, and staggers away, accidentally setting the building on fire with his victory cigar. Chester dies playing \"The Song Is You\" on the piano as the building burns.","m_cast":"Mark McKinney as Chester Kent Isabella Rossellini as Lady Helen Port-Huntley Maria de Medeiros as Narcissa David Fox as Fyodor Kent Ross McMillan as Roderick Kent / Gravillo the Great Louis Negin as Blind Seer Darcy Fehr as Teddy Claude Dorge as Duncan Elksworth Talia Pura as Mary Jeff Sutton as Young Chester Graeme Valentin as Young Roderick Maggie Nagle as Chester's Mother","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Guy Maddin","m_produced_by":"Niv Fichman Daniel Iron Jody Shapiro Executive Producer Atom Egoyan","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Isabella Rossellini Mark McKinney Maria de Medeiros David Fox Ross McMillan Louis Negin","m_music_by":"Christopher Dedrick","m_cinematography":"Luc Montpellier","m_edited_by":"David Wharnsby","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"IFC Films (US theatrical) MGM (North America DVD)","m_release_dates":"September 07, 2003 (Canada) October 25, 2003 (UK) February 14, 2004 (US)","m_running_time":"99 minutes","m_country":"Canada","m_language":"English","m_budget":"CAD $3.8 million (estimated)[1] | The Saddest Music in the World is a 2003 Canadian film directed by Guy Maddin, budgeted at $3.8-million (a large budget relative to the average Canadian film)[2] and shot over 24 days.[3] The film was Maddin's first collaboration with Isabella Rossellini, who subsequently appeared in a number of Maddin's films, and co-created a film with him about her father Roberto Rossellini. | Maddin and co-writer George Toles based the film on an original screenplay written by Booker Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, from which they kept \"the title, the premise and the contest – to determine which country’s music was the saddest\" but otherwise re-wrote.[4] Like most of Guy Maddin's films, The Saddest Music in the World is filmed in a style that imitates late 1920s and early 1930s cinema, with grainy black-and-white photography, slightly out-of-sync sound and expressionist art design. A few scenes are filmed in colour, in a manner that imitates early two-strip Technicolor. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Beard, William.
