Internationally, the film is expected to fare better due to the ever expanding overseas markets such as in markets like Russia, South Korea, China and Latin America.[47]","m_production":"With director J. J. Abrams returning as a producer-only of the third film while focusing on Star Wars: The Force Awakens,[5][6][7][8] writer Roberto Orci replaced him as director in May 2014.[9][10][11] However, in December Orci's role was changed to producer only as well,[12] with Edgar Wright considered to replace him, along with a shortlist of directors including Rupert Wyatt, Morten Tyldum, Daniel Espinosa, Justin Lin, and Duncan Jones.[13] Also, Star Trek actor and film director Jonathan Frakes expressed interest in the job.[14] At the end of the month, Lin was announced as director of the third installment.[15] | In 2013, Orci had begun writing the script with Patrick McKay and John D. Payne,[16][17] with Payne saying of the script in March, \"We really want to get back to the sense of exploration and wonder. The kind of optimistic sense of the future that Star Trek has always kind of had at its core. It's the Chicago Bulls in space, in terms of these people who are all awesome at their job.\"[18] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay,[19] with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount \"had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that it might have been a little bit too Star Trek-y.\" Pegg had been asked to make the new film \"more inclusive\", stating that the solution was to \"make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent.\"[20] Orci, Payne and McKay are given official \"written by\" credit alongside Pegg and Jung, although Pegg clarified that neither he nor Jung had read the existing script before crafting their own for the film.[21] | The first film's major cast members signed on for two sequels as part of their original deals.[22] In 2014, early in the film's development, William Shatner said that he was contacted by producer Abrams to see if he would be interested in a possible role, but as the process continued and the script changed hands, the role never materialized.[23][24] In March 2015, Idris Elba was in early talks to play the villain, and he was confirmed for the role in the following months.[25][26] Pegg noted that the villain would be an original one, rather than a known antagonist from past stories in the Star Trek franchise.[27] In April, Sofia Boutella was joined the cast in an unspecified lead role,[28] and in early July, Deep Roy was confirmed to reprise his role of Keenser.[29] That month, Joe Taslim was added to the cast in a role opposite Elba's villain,[30] and by August, Lydia Wilson joined in an unspecified role.[31] In March 2016, Shohreh Aghdashloo was cast as the High Command of the Federation for reshoots on the film.[32] | Principal photography on the film began on June 25, 2015, in Vancouver,[33] and Squamish, British Columbia, after several delays caused by multiple script rejections.[34][35][36][37] Additional filming locations were Seoul, South Korea, and Dubai, UAE.[38][39] Principal filming ended on October 15, 2015. In March 2016, production underwent reshoots, with Aghdashloo added to the cast.[32] | In August 2015, composer Michael Giacchino confirmed that he will be returning to write the score.[40] On June 26, 2016, Barbadian singer Rihanna released a teaser across her social media accounts for an single for the film entitled \"Sledgehammer\", confirming that the song premiered the following day.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Star Trek  by Gene Roddenberry","m_directed_by":"Justin Lin","m_produced_by":"J.
