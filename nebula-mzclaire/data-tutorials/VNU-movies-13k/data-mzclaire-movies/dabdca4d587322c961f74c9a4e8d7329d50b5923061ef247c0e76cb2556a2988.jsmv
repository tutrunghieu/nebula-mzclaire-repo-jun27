{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During a holiday with his grandmother Helga in Norway, 10-year-old English boy Luke Eveshim (Jasen Fisher) is told stories about \"real\" witches, demonic females with a genocidal hatred for children, all of whom emit an odor obnoxious to witches. Helga tells him that her childhood friend was taken and cursed to spend the rest of her life trapped inside a painting. After Luke's parents are killed in a car crash, Helga becomes Luke's legal guardian and they move to England. While building a treehouse, Luke is accosted by a witch, though he sees through her ruse and avoids his potential death. On Luke's birthday, Helga falls ill and is diagnosed with diabetes. Her doctor advises them to spend the summer by the sea so Helga can recover. | They stay at a seaside resort, where Luke meets a gluttonous but friendly boy, Bruno Jenkins (Charlie Potter), while getting on the bad side of the hotel manager, Mr. Stringer, after his pet mice frighten a maid who is having an affair with the manager. Also staying at the hotel are all of England's witches, masquerading as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, with the Grand High Witch, the leader of all the world's witches, attending their conference. Luke inadvertently discovers the witches while playing with his pet mice inside the ballroom, where the witches hold their meeting. The Grand High Witch unveils her latest weapon: a formula to turn children into mice, which they will use on confectionery products in sweet shops and candy stores to be opened using a hoard of English money provided by the Grand High Witch. Bruno is lured into the room to be given chocolate laced with the formula. He turns into a mouse and flees. Luke attempts to escape but is also captured and turned into a mouse, though he avoids being squashed, finds Bruno and reunites with Helga. | Luke devises a plan to kill the witches by sneaking into the Grand High Witch's room to steal a bottle of the formula. He succeeds, evading the Grand High Witch's cat. Helga attempts to return Bruno to his parents, but they refuse to believe her story. Mrs. Jenkins has a fear of mice, causing her to become hysterical on seeing Bruno in mouse form. At the witches' dinner, Luke manages to drop the bottle into a pot of watercress soup, which was on the witches' menu. Mr. Jenkins also orders the soup, though Helga stops him from consuming it at the last minute. The formula turns all of the witches into mice, proving Helga's story about Bruno. The staff and hotel guests join in killing the mice, unknowingly ridding England of its witches, as Helga returns Bruno to his parents. The Grand High Witch is spotted by Helga, who traps her under a water jug, enabling Mr. Stringer to despatch her with a meat cleaver. | Luke and Helga return to their home, where they are delivered the Grand High Witch's trunk full of money and an address book of all the world's witches. Luke (who had secretly readdressed the trunk at the resort) suggests that they might use it to eradicate the world's witches once and for all. That night, the Grand High Witch's assistant Miss Irvine, who had quit her job and escaped the massacre, pays a visit to the house and uses her power to return Luke to human form before leaving to repeat the process with Bruno.","m_cast":"Anjelica Huston as Miss Ernst/Grand High Witch | Jasen Fisher as Luke Eveshim | Mai Zetterling as Helga Eveshim | Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Stringer | Jane Horrocks as Miss Susan Irvine | Charlie Potter as Bruno Jenkins | Anne Lambton as Pamela (The Woman in Black) | Annabel Brooks as Nicola Cuttle | Sukie Smith as Marlene | Bill Paterson as Albert Jenkins | Brenda Blethyn as Rebecca Jenkins | Jenny Runacre as Elizabeth \"Elsie\" | Emma Relph as Mildred \"Millie\" | Rose English as Doreen \"Dora\" | Nora Connolly as Beatrice | Rosamund Greenwood as Janice | Darcy Flynn as Luke's Mother | Vincent Marzello as Luke's Father | Ola Otnes as Erica's Father | Serena Harragin as Doctor | Jim Carter as Andre, the Chef | Roberta Taylor as Jacqueline (Chef Witch) | Angelique Rockas as Henrietta | Stella Tanner as Loisette \"Lois\" Leffour | Barbara Hicks as Regina | The following people have done special puppeteer work in this film: | Anthony Asbury | Don Austen – Luke's Mouse Form, Bruno's Mouse Form | Sue Dacre | David Greenaway – Mice | Brian Henson | Robert Tygner – Mice | Steve Whitmire","m_reception":"The Witches was generally well received by critics and audiences alike, but performed poorly at the box office.[5] The film holds a rare 100% in the film critics site Rotten Tomatoes, out of 32 reviews. The general consensus is: \"With a deliciously wicked performance from Anjelica Huston and imaginative puppetry by Jim Henson's creature shop, Nicolas Roeg's dark and witty movie captures the spirit of Roald Dahl's writing like few other adaptations.\"[6] Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling the film \"an intriguing movie, ambitious and inventive, and almost worth seeing just for Anjelica Huston's obvious delight in playing a completely uncompromised villainess.\"[7] Roald Dahl regarded the film as \"utterly appalling\" because of the ending that contrasted with the book.[8] | Nominated – Saturn Award for Best Actress (Anjelica Huston) | Nominated – Saturn Award for Best Make-up (John Stephenson) | Nominated – Saturn Award for Best Music (Stanley Myers) | Nominated – Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Jasen Fisher) | Nominated – Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress (Mai Zetterling) | Nominated – BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair (Christine Beveridge) | Won – Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress (Anjelica Huston) | Nominated – International Fantasy Film Award for Best Film (Nicolas Roeg) | Nominated – Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation | Won – Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress (Anjelica Huston) | Won – National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress (Anjelica Huston)","m_production":"The Witches based on the book of the same name by British author Roald Dahl.[2] It was the final film that Jim Henson personally worked on before his death, the final theatrical film produced by Lorimar Productions, and the last film made based on Dahl's material before his death (both Henson and Dahl died that year). | The whole section in the start of the film (until they move to the United Kingdom) was shot in Bergen in Norway. Much of the film was shot on location in the Headland Hotel[3] (which was named \"Hotel Excelsior\" in the film) situated on the coast in Newquay, Cornwall. Roald Dahl originally wanted Cher to play the role of the Grand High Witch, but she was unavailable at the time because the actress was filming Mermaids. Eartha Kitt, Fiona Fullerton, Geneviève Bujold, Starr Andreeff, Olivia Hussey, Sigourney Weaver, Frances Conroy, and Liza Minnelli were all at some point considered for the part of The Grand High Witch prior to Anjelica Huston’s casting.
