{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Barney Springboro (Scott Baio) is a high school science nerd at Emerson High in Los Angeles who obtains telekinetic powers after a lab accident. Along with his best friend Peyton Nichols (Willie Aames), a wealthy playboy with a dirty mind, Barney uses his new powers to take revenge upon bullies, cheat at baseball, and strip girls, particularly the beautiful but snobby Jane Mitchell (Heather Thomas). Barney comes to realize that the best girl for him is actually Bernadette (Felice Schachter), the school's nerdy feminist class president who also becomes privy to his secret powers. After typical hi-jinks, the film's climax is set at the school's senior prom which Barney uses his powers to disrobe several people when he loses his self control, a parody climax of Stephen King's Carrie. After he gets hit on the head with a fire hose, he wakes up later and discovers that he no longer has his powers, to the dismay and relief of both Peyton and Bernadette. However, in the final scene it is revealed that this is a lie as Barney escorts Bernadette from the building and uses his powers to levitate himself and her away.","m_cast":"Scott Baio as Barney Springboro | Willie Aames as Peyton Nichols | Felice Schachter as Bernadette | Heather Thomas as Jane Mitchell | Robert Mandan as Principal Walter J.

It was filmed largely at John Marshall High School in Los Angeles during the spring of 1981 with the students as extras. The storyline rarely leaves the high school. The students talk mostly about social life and college plans, while the prom is in the gym. The senior trip is to the local amusement park. Of the major stars, however, only Felice Schachter was still a high school student when the film was shot. In fact, she missed her own prom to shoot the prom sequence in the film. | The film used a body-double for Thomas' nude scenes,[3] as she refused to remove her own clothes; further controversy was generated when a complaint was filed by Thomas about a likeness of her head being pasted onto someone else's nude body.[4] | The film's soundtrack was composed by Charles Fox and Miles Goodman[5] and featured performances by Joe \"Bean\" Esposito (\"Updike's Theme\") and David Pomeranz (\"Got to Believe in Magic\", \"King and Queen of Hearts\"), which were big hits in the Philippines.","m_sequel":"Despite initially negative reviews, Zapped! became a cult classic, selling heavily in videos. In 1990, it spawned a direct-to-video sequel, Zapped Again! (with only Sue Ane Langdon returning from the original cast).","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert J.
