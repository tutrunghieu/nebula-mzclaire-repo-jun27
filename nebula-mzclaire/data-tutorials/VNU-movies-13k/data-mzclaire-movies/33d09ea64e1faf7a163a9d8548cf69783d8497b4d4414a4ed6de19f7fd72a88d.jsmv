It was directed by Lionel Chetwynd, and stars Michael Moriarty, Ken Wright, and Paul Le Mat. | The film portrays fictional characters, not specific American POWs. It earned less than $1 million in its initial theatrical release,[1] but a Warner Bros. Home Entertainment VHS release gained a cult following, especially among veterans.[1] | A DVD release of the film had been anticipated for some time in 2008, with the package to include a new interview with former POW and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain.[1] However, the film's release was suspended by Warner Bros. due to McCain being the Republican Party nominee.[2][3] The week following the 2008 US presidential election, the DVD went forward into release.[4]","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Michael Cieply (2008-05-29). \"McCain’s Quiet Cinematic Turn\".
