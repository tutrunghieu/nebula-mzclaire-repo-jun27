{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In its essentials, the plot is the same as that of Roger Corman's 1955 film The Fast and the Furious. | Twenty-eight-year-old Jackson \"Jack\" Davis Hammond (Charlie Sheen) is sentenced to 25 years in prison for an armed robbery he did not commit, but manages to escape. To get away from the police while at a convenience store, he takes a hostage, California heiress Natalie Voss (Kristy Swanson), the only daughter of multimillionaire Dalton Voss (Ray Wise). Threatening Natalie with a candy bar, posing for a gun, Jack disarms a pair of unseasoned, intervening officers. Jack takes their guns then drives off in Natalie's BMW. The chase quickly becomes broadcast live on every TV channel, with scenes filming news coverage from helicopters, the back seat of a police car, and the pavement of the highway. Natalie eventually gets to know Jack during the chase, and later sympathizes with the \"gun-wielding, cop-shooting, maniac kidnapper\" by comparing her life to his and realizes their similarities despite having different backgrounds. She falls in love with him and begins to believe in him. Later, they start kissing and end up having sex while Jack is driving. Jack plans on escaping into Mexico and Natalie proposes a future together. | When the cops block off the border crossing to Mexico, Jack stops before reaching the border, and releases Natalie. She reluctantly leaves and in the final confrontation with the police, Jack appears to be defiant and goes down in a blaze of glory. Moments later, however, this is revealed to be a mental projection of what would happen if he does not surrender. Jack surrenders, but Natalie takes a television producer hostage with the gun given to her by Jack before she was surrendered to the police. Natalie blows up a nearby police helicopter, hijacks a news helicopter, and escapes with Jack across the border into Mexico. The next scene reveals that after some time has passed, they are relaxing in freedom on a beach.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"The director told Henry Rollins that he was funnier than the lines written in the script. Consequently, almost all of his performance is ad libbed. | The extensive chase and crash scenes were not filmed on a California expressway, but on a newly completed and unopened stretch of highway in Harris County, on the north side of Houston, Texas (specifically- the Hardy Tollway, the west side of the Sam Houston Tollway and a stretch of U.S. 290). Dozens of mature palm trees were trucked in and planted along the highway to provide southern California ambiance. | The car used by Charlie Sheen throughout most of the film is a red BMW E36 325iS (Natalie's car), however during some parts of the love-making scene between him and Swanson, it is shot in a larger BMW E34 5 Series.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Adam Rifkin","m_produced_by":"Cassian Elwes Brad Wyman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Charlie Sheen Kristy Swanson Rocky Carroll Henry Rollins Josh Mostel Ray Wise","m_music_by":"Richard Gibbs","m_cinematography":"Alan Jones","m_edited_by":"Peter Schink","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"March 4, 1994 (1994-03-04) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"89 min.","m_country":null,"m_language":"English","m_budget":"$4.5 million","m_box_office":"$7,924,955 | The Chase is a 1994 American crime comedy road film starring Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson.
