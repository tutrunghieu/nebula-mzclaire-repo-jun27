It is best known for being the last film of Bette Davis, who withdrew from the project after filming began, citing major problems with the script and the way she was being photographed. Cohen later claimed she really dropped out due to ill health but avoided publicizing the truth for fear it would affect potential future employment. The actress died eight months after the film was released. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ TV Guide review","m_external_link":"Wicked Stepmother at the Internet Movie Database | Wicked Stepmother at Rotten Tomatoes | Wicked Stepmother at Box Office Mojo | I Killed Bette Davis","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Wickedstepmother.jpg/220px-Wickedstepmother.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Larry Cohen"}
