{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Based on actual events, this film tells the story of the 1939 voyage of the MS St. Louis, which departed from Hamburg carrying 937 Jews from Germany, ostensibly to Havana, Cuba. The passengers, having seen and suffered rising anti-Semitism in Germany, realised this might be their only chance to escape. The film details the emotional journey of the passengers who gradually become aware that their passage was planned as an exercise in propaganda, and that it had never been intended that they disembark in Cuba. Rather, they were to be set up as Pariahs, to set an example before the world. As a Nazi official states in the film, when the whole world has refused to accept them as refugees, no country can blame Germany for the fate of the Jews. | The Cuban Government refuses entry to the passengers, and as the liner waits off the Florida coast, they learn that the United States also has rejected them, leaving the ship no choice but to return to Europe. The captain tells a confidante that he has received a letter signed by 200 passengers saying they will join hands and jump into the sea rather than return to Germany. He states his intention to run the liner aground on a reef off the southern coast of England. | Shortly before the film's end, it is revealed that the governments of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have each agreed to accept a share of the passengers as refugees. As they cheer and clap at the news, footnotes disclose the fates of some of the main characters, suggesting that more than 600 of the 937 passengers who did not make it to the UK ultimately lost their lives in Nazi concentration camps.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"According to Lew Grade who helped finance the film, the movie \"should have done better\" at the box office.[7]","m_production":"The movie was filmed on board the chartered Italian ocean liner Irpinia,[2] which was fitted with two false funnels in order to resemble the St. Louis.[3] It was also shot on location in Barcelona, Spain, St. Pancras Chambers in London, and at the EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Voyage of the Damned  by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts","m_directed_by":"Stuart Rosenberg","m_produced_by":"Robert Fryer William Hill","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Faye Dunaway Oskar Werner Lee Grant Max von Sydow James Mason Malcolm McDowell","m_music_by":"Lalo Schifrin","m_cinematography":"Billy Williams","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":"ITC Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"AVCO Embassy Pictures","m_release_dates":"22 December 1976 (1976-12-22) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"155 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | Voyage of the Damned is a 1976 drama film, which was based on a 1974 book written by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts with the same title.[1] | The story was inspired by true events concerning the fate of the MS St. Louis ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Germany to Cuba in 1939. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Thomas, Gordon; Morgan-Witts, Max (1974).
