{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for safekeeping, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones, representing the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the element stones in time to stop the great evil when it returns. | In 2263,[b] the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), informs the President of the Federated Territories (Tom Lister Jr.) of the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has been instructed by the great evil to acquire the stones. | The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, though the stones are not on board; the only item recovered is a hand of The Fifth Element. Scientists take it to a New York City laboratory and use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings, she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a former major in the special forces. | Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David (Charlie Creed-Miles), whereupon Cornelius learns that the Mondoshawans entrusted the four element stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna (Maïwenn Le Besco), an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones, but their compatriots determine to seize the artifacts for themselves. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro (Brion James), Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury intergalactic cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the ancient temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner. | Plavalaguna is killed when the Mangalores attack the ship, but Dallas succeeds in retrieving the stones from the Diva. During his struggle with the Mangalores he kills their leader. Meanwhile, Zorg shoots and seriously wounds Leeloo, before finding a carrying case that he presumes contains the stones and takes it back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft. | The four join up with David at the weapon chamber in the Egyptian temple as the great evil approaches. They arrange the stones and are able to activate them with their corresponding elements, but having witnessed and studied so much violence, Leeloo has become disenchanted with humanity and refuses to cooperate. Dallas confesses his love for Leeloo and kisses her. In response, Leeloo combines the power of the stones and releases the divine light on the great evil and destroying its power, causing the planet to be proclaimed dead by Earth scientists as it becomes another moon in Earth orbit.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"As a teenager, Besson envisioned the world of The Fifth Element in an attempt to alleviate boredom. He began writing the script when he was 16, though it was not released in cinemas until he was 38.[15] The original storyline was set in the year 2300, and was about a \"nobody\" named Zaltman Bleros (later renamed Korben Dallas) who wins a trip to the Club Med resort on the planet Fhloston Paradise. There he meets Leeloo, a \"sand-girl\" who has the \"beauty of youth\" despite being over 2,000 years old.[16] Besson continued to work on and modify the storyline for years; by the time his film Atlantis was released in 1991 he had a 400-page script. Nicolas Seydoux and Patrice Ledoux from Gaumont were the first people to take on the project. In November 1991, while looking for actors for the film, Besson met French comics creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières and recruited them[17] for the film's production design.[18][19] Giraud and Mézières's comics were a major source of inspiration for Besson's futuristic New York City.[20] Mézières wrote the book The Circles of Power, which features a character named S'Traks, who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air traffic of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Mézières showed images of the flying taxi to Besson, who was inspired to change the background of Korben Dallas from a worker in a rocketship factory to that of a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York.[21] Five other artists were hired for the project, and Jean Paul Gaultier was hired to design the film's costumes. The team spent a year creating over 8,000 drawings, during which time Besson approached both Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the lead role. Willis expressed interest, though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films, Hudson Hawk and Billy Bathgate, had been received poorly; Gibson eventually turned down the role.[22] While the team impressed film companies with their designs, they struggled to find one willing to take on the film's budget of almost $100 million. In December 1992 production of the film stopped[23] without any prior warning, and the team disbanded.[3] | Besson went on to direct the commercially successful film Léon: The Professional, which was released in September 1994. While shooting and releasing Leon, he continued to work on the script for The Fifth Element, shortening it and reducing the film's budget to $90 million before attempting to find a studio willing to produce it. Columbia Pictures, who had a partnership in Leon, agreed to finance the film. By this time Besson had decided to go with a lesser-known lead actor in order to save on production costs.[3][8] Besson was in Barry Josephson's office when Willis called regarding a different film. Besson asked to speak to Willis \"just to say hello\", and told him that The Fifth Element was finally going ahead, explaining the decision to go with a less-expensive actor. After a short silence, Willis stated \"If I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement\";[3] he agreed to take on the role after reading the script. Production of the film commenced in early August 1995. Besson traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London and Rome.[25] He chose to hire Gary Oldman, who had starred in Léon, for the role of Zorg, describing Oldman as \"one of the top five actors in the world.\"[8] For the character Leeloo, Besson chose Milla Jovovich from the 200 to 300 applicants he met in person.[8] The \"Divine Language\" spoken in the film by Leeloo is a fictional language with only 400 words, invented by Besson. Jovovich and Besson held conversations and wrote letters to each other in the language as practice.[26] Besson was in a relationship with Maïwenn Le Besco, who played the role of Diva Plavalaguna, for six years when filming commenced; however, he left her for Jovovich during filming.[27] Jovovich and Besson later married, but divorced in 1999.[28] | Despite wishing to shoot the film in France, Besson could not find suitable facilities and \"with a heavy heart\" instead filmed in London.[29] It was primarily filmed at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages[30] including the 007 Stage.[31] Construction of sets began in October 1995.[17] The opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House.[32] Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in Mauritania;[33] the first shoot for the film, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996.[34] Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later.[35] Willis finished filming on 16 May,[36] while Oldman only commenced filming the following week;[37] the film's protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time.[38] Despite being filmed in London, The Fifth Element was a French production,[39][40] and went on to become the costliest European film ever made at the time.[41] The buildings in New York were derived from both metabolist-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s, and the futuristic designs of architect Antonio Sant'Elia in the 1910s.[42] Besson demanded that most of the action shots in the film take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction films, and wanted a brighter \"cheerfully crazy\" look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one.[20] Gaultier designed every one of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the film's Fhloston Paradise scenes, and checked each costume every morning.[38] His designs, described as \"intellectually transgressive\",[43] were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms.[44] A single jacket he designed for the film cost $5,000.[45] | The original name of the character Ruby Rhod was Loc Rhod. The name appears in both the original script and in the novelisation of the film.[46] Speculation has been raised that the name change was a play on information in the periodic table. Rubidium is the first of the Period 5 elements, and exactly halfway down that row is the element Rhodium. Taking the first half of each element yields \"Rubi Rhod\".[47] Others have speculated his name is a play on his gender bending personality; having a feminine first name and phallic surname.[10] The term \"ruby rod\" also refers to the essential component of the first working laser design.[48] | Three different teams handled the three different types of special effects used in the film. Nick Allder was placed in charge of mechanical and pyrotechnical effects, Nick Dudman was placed in charge of 'creature' effects and Mark Stetson headed the visual effects team.[30] Visual effects company Digital Domain was hired for the film, and Karen Goulekas was given the role of digital effects supervisor.[49] Alias,[33] Autodesk Softimage, Arete, Side Effect's Prisms, RenderMan, as well as in-house software, were used by Digital Domain to create effects.[50] Some individual shots used a combination of live action, scale models, computer-generated imagery and particle systems.[51] The lanes of traffic in the scenes in New York City were created with particle systems: | We had maybe 80 cityscape shots with CG cars hurtling around, and you couldn't animate them all by hand because there were just too many of them in each scene ... When the cars turned a corner, the velocity changes were automatic, so the animator didn't have to worry about that. They just planned the moves in a very blocky way, and the mathematics smoothed out the rest. | Amongst the scale models used for filming were the buildings seen in New York City. Dozens of apartment blocks and 25 skyscrapers, some 20 feet (6.1 m) high, were constructed in 1/24th scale.[53] It took a team of 80 workers five months to build the models used in the film.[53] The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time-consuming tasks, along with details behind the windows, such as furniture, blinds, lightboxes and tiny pieces of flat artwork.[53] Virtual sets built within digital environments were created to enhance the use of miniatures.[54] Motion control cameras moved throughout the scale sets, and the data they collected was exported to track and generate the CG animation and particle systems.[42] Other techniques used in the film included digital matte paintings for backgrounds[55] and the NURBS mathematical model for certain animations, including the sequence in which Leeloo's body is reconstructed.[56] | The Fifth Element is one of Besson's films which have been described as \"intrinsically musical\";[57] some kind of music is playing during about 90 percent of the film.[58] The film's score was composed by Éric Serra. He relies heavily on the use of orchestral textures, such as the oboe and strings heard as the surgeons prepare to regenerate Leeloo, and the pizzicato as she is reconstructed. Serra also used many exotic influences, such as the Stalinist fanfare heard before the spaceport sequence, the reggae piece played in preparation for the flight, and the hula music that greets the passengers as they arrive in Fhloston.[59] More conventional scoring techniques are present in the leitmotif that first appears when professor Pacoli mentions the fifth element, the militaristic snares as the warship prepares to attack the dark planet, and the Mahlerian funereal piece heard when Leeloo learns about war.[59] The music used for the taxicab chase scene, titled \"Alech Taadi\" by Algerian performer Khaled,[60][61] is excluded from the film soundtrack, but is available on Khaled's album N'ssi N'ssi.[62] | The Diva Dance opera performance featured music from Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor: \"Il dolce suono\",[63] the mad scene of Act III, Scene 2. It is one of the few pieces of music in the film that is diegetic.[64] It was sung by Albanian soprano Inva Mula,[65] while the role of Plavalaguna was played by French actress Maïwenn Le Besco.[27] Part One (titled \"Lucia di Lammermoor\") and Part Two (titled \"The Diva Dance\") of this piece are included as separate tracks on The Fifth Element soundtrack, but are sequenced to create the effect of the entire performance seen in the film. The end of Part One blends into the beginning of Part Two, creating a smooth transition between the two tracks.[66] | Released as an album under Virgin Records, the soundtrack peaked at No. 99 on the Billboard 200.[67] More than 200,000 copies of the lengthy soundtrack were sold in France alone.[68] Rodney Batdorf of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating it was \"diverse and accomplished, and it is just as effective outside of the film as it is within it.\"[69] A review from Filmtracks.com also awarded the album three out of five stars.[70]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Luc Besson","m_produced_by":"Patrice Ledoux","m_screenplay_by":"Luc Besson | Robert Mark Kamen","m_story_by":"Luc Besson","m_starring":"Bruce Willis | Gary Oldman | Ian Holm | Chris Tucker | Milla Jovovich","m_music_by":"Éric Serra","m_cinematography":"Thierry Arbogast","m_edited_by":"Sylvie Landra","m_production_company":"Gaumont","m_distributed_by":"Gaumont Buena Vista International[1] (France) Columbia Pictures (USA)","m_release_dates":"7 May 1997 (1997-05-07) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"126 minutes[2]","m_country":"France","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$90 million[3][4][5][6][a]","m_box_office":"$263.9 million[7] | The Fifth Element (French: Le Cinquième Élément) is a 1997 English-language French science fiction action film directed and co-written by Luc Besson. It stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich. Primarily set in the 23rd century, the film's central plot involves the survival of planet Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Willis), a taxicab driver and former special forces major, after a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his cab. Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against an impending attack. | Besson started writing the story that became The Fifth Element when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Besson wanted to shoot the film in France, but suitable locations could not be found; filming took place instead in London and Mauritania. Comics writers Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières, whose comics provided inspiration for parts of the film, were hired for production design. Costume design was by Jean Paul Gaultier. | The Fifth Element received mainly positive reviews, although it tended to polarize critics. It has been called both the best and worst summer blockbuster of all time. The film was a financial success, earning more than $263 million at the box office on a $90 million budget. At the time of its release it was the most expensive European film ever made, and it remained the highest-grossing French film at the international box office until the release of The Intouchables in 2011. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Le Cinquième élément\" [The Fifth Element].
