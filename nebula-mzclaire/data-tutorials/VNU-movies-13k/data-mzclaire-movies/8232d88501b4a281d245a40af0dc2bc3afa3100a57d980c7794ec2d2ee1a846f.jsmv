{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jamie Douglas is a beautiful TV newswoman with a successful career in Los Angeles and a stable relationship with her boyfriend, Brandon. Derek is a psychopathic photographer who stalks her. The movie is unusual in that in the very first scene, when Jamie is swimming naked in her swimming pool, Derek is already obsessed with her, and photographing her with a long lens from his house. He calls her then and says \"I watched you tonight.\" We think he means in the pool, but we find out next scene that she is a TV newswoman, so she does not think the call that odd, just a fan. | The next day Derek sends her flowers. That evening he calls her at her house to ask how she liked them, creeping her out. She tells him to leave her alone. The next day he shows up at the TV station with a box of chocolates to apologize for coming on too strong. She accepts the chocolates. He follows her home and forces his way into her house. She tells him to leave but he starts taking pictures of her, basically assaulting her, telling her she looks good when she's scared and screaming. Brandon shows up, beats up Derek, and kicks him out. Jamie and Brandon go to the cops (Captain Maxwell) but he says there's nothing he can do about it. | Brandon talks to a psychiatrist, who tells him that eventually Derek will kill Jamie. | Jamie goes shopping with her friend (played by Coleen Camp), and Derek follows them. Jamie yells at Derek and throws on the ground the music box he tries to give her. | At home that night is another extended nude scene with Jamie taking a bath. Derek is in the closet watching her. She discovers him and they struggle, then Brandon comes home again but Derek disappears out the window. | The cop Maxwell figures out who Derek is and tells Brandon he will give Derek a talking to. Jamie gets naked again and has sex with Brandon in the hot tub, but as Brandon is coming he cries out a little too loudly, and slumps against Jamie's naked body in the hot tub--Derek has snuck into the house and stabbed Brandon in the back as they are making love, killing him. Derek then, inexplicably, drags Brandon's body into the woods and buries him, then goes home. | Jamie calls Derek and says he should come over. She has a shotgun that Brandon bought for her, and wants to kill him with it. She takes all her clothes off so she's naked, then gets into bed to wait for him. The girl that is in love with Derek shows up to tell him that the police are after him and he should cool it with Jamie. He yells at her and storms out of the house back to Jamie's. | Jamie tries to shoot Derek but misses. He takes a knife and tries to rape her, then she starts to take off his clothes aggressively. Derek is turned off by this. Jamie says he's not a real man. Then Derek attacks her again, and the girl that likes Derek, who followed him to Jamie's house, picks up the shotgun and shoots Derek, killing him dead.","m_cast":"Morgan Fairchild as Jamie Douglas | Michael Sarrazin as Brandon | Vince Edwards as Maxwell | Andrew Stevens as Derek | Colleen Camp as Robin | Kevin Brophy as Bobby","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Schmoeller","m_produced_by":"Frank Capra, Jr. (executive producer) Bruce Cohn Curtis (producer) Tom Curtis (associate producer) Chuck Russell (executive producer) Joseph Wolf (executive producer) Irwin Yablans (producer)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Morgan Fairchild | Michael Sarrazin | Vince Edwards | Andrew Stevens | Colleen Camp | Kevin Brophy","m_music_by":"Lalo Schifrin","m_cinematography":"Mac Ahlberg","m_edited_by":"Anthony DiMarco","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Embassy Pictures","m_release_dates":"January 29, 1982 (1982-01-29) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$11,378,339[1] | The Seduction is a 1982 thriller film starring Morgan Fairchild and Andrew Stevens, written and directed by David Schmoeller.
