{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Eddie Yang (Jackie Chan) is a Hong Kong police inspector co-operating with Interpol in the capture of a crime lord named AJ \"Snakehead\" Staul (Julian Sands). Snakehead procures an ancient book from a Chinese bookstore keeper, which tells the story of a boy being chosen every thousand years to bind the two-halves of a legendary medallion. In Hong Kong, Eddie and Interpol agent Arthur Watson (Lee Evans) lead a raid to capture Snakehead and his men, who are about to kidnap the boy, named Jai (Alex Bao). Eddie and the agents fight off Snakehead's men, infiltrating the temple containing Jai. Jai is saved but Snakehead eludes them. Two weeks later Snakehead captures Jai aboard a cargo boat in Hong Kong. Eddie and a team of Hong Kong police engage and defeat several of Snakehead's men, but Snakehead escapes with Jai to Dublin, Ireland. | In Ireland, Eddie is assigned to help Interpol with the investigation, much to Watson's chagrin. Eddie is also reunited with his girlfriend, a British Interpol agent named Nicole James (Claire Forlani). By chance Eddie later encounters and apprehends one of Snakehead's top men, who confesses Jai is being held in the harbour. Eddie, Watson, and Nicole move to rescue Jai, defeating several Snakehead agents in the process. Eddie and Jai end up trapped inside a container, which is knocked into the water by one of Snakehead's men before they can be released. Eddie keeps Jai alive by finding an inflatable tent, and securely putting Jai inside but Eddie dies from drowning. After being rescued, Jai uses his medallion on Eddie's body. | In the morgue, Watson is grieving over Eddie's body and is prepared to say his last words, when Eddie suddenly appears beside him. Eddie realises Jai used the medallion to resurrect him, and his former body vanishes into nothingness. Jai splits the medallion into its two-halves, giving one of them to Eddie. Snakehead's men appear in the hospital to recapture Jai and during the fight, Eddie discovers the medallion has also granted him superhuman strength and immortality. | Nicole looks after Jai but he is captured again by Snakehead. At his castle hideout, Snakehead forces Jai to activate the medallion so he can gain its power, but with only one half of it, Snakehead only gains superhuman strength and remains mortal. To steal the other half, Snakehead and his men attack Watson's family. Watson's Chinese wife is revealed to be a police operative like him, much to Watson's surprise as he kept his job secret from his family. Together they fight off the attack from Snakehead's men. | Eddie, Watson and Nicole learn the location of Snakehead's castle lair and go to finish him once and for all. The operation runs smoothly at first, but Snakehead kills Nicole and becomes immortal. He and Eddie engage in a vicious fight, until Eddie uses the medallion to take away the life it gave, which leads to the two dragons from the medallion appearing and taking Snakehead, which traps him in the medallion. Jai allows Eddie to use the medallion to resurrect Nicole, who also gains super-strength and immortality. The two then run at superhuman speed into the distance as Jai enters another dimension through a portal, frightening Watson.","m_cast":"Jackie Chan as Inspector Eddie Yang | Lee Evans as Interpol Inspector Arthur Watson | Claire Forlani as Inspector Nicole James | Alex Bao as Jai | Julian Sands as Snakehead/AJ Staul | Johann Myers as Giscard | John Rhys-Davies as Commander Hammerstock-Smythe | Anthony Wong Chau Sang as Lester Wong (Snakehead's assistant) (as Anthony Wong) | Christy Chung as Charlotte Watson | Billy Hill as Miles Watson | Nicholas Tse as waiter at the restaurant (cameo) | Edison Chen as waiter at the restaurant (cameo) | Scott Adkins | Bruce Khan | Han Guan Hua | Paul Andreovski | Nicola Berwick | Reuben Langdon (as Reuben Christopher Langdon) | Hiro Hayama (as Hiroyoshi Komuro) | Mark Strange (as Michael Strange) | Matt Routledge (as Matthew James Routledge) | Chris Torres (uncredited) | Brad Allan (uncredited) | Jude Poyer (uncredited) | ","m_reception":"In its US release, The Medallion was No. 5 at the box office on its opening weekend and fell steadily lower during its 10-week release.
