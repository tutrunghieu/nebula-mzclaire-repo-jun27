Much of Japan's infrastructure had been destroyed during World War II and the Olympics were seen as a chance to re-introduce Japan to the world and show off its new modernised roads and industry as well as its burgeoning economy. Every Olympics since the first modern games in 1896 Summer Olympics had been committed to film to some extent or another, usually financed by the International Olympic Committee for reasons of posterity. For the 1964 Olympics the Japanese government decided to finance their own film and initially hired Akira Kurosawa who, at the time, was the most famous Japanese director worldwide thanks to films such as Ikiru and Seven Samurai. However, Kurosawa's famous tendency for complete control - he demanded to not only direct the film but the opening and closing ceremonies as well - led to his dismissal. This led to the bringing in of Ichikawa, who had a reputation of coming into productions where events hadn't followed the initial plans.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Kon Ichikawa","m_produced_by":"Suketarō Taguchi","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":"Toshiro Mayuzumi","m_cinematography":"Kazuo Miyagawa","m_edited_by":"Tatsuji Nakashizu","m_production_company":"Organizing Committee for the Games of the XVIII Olympiad Toho Company","m_distributed_by":"Toho (USA) Actueel Film (1965) (Netherlands) Dino de Laurentiis Distribuzione (1966) (Italy) American Broadcasting Company(1968) (USA) (TV) Criterion Collection, The (2004) (USA)","m_release_dates":"March 20, 1965 (1965-03-20) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"170 minutes","m_country":"Japan","m_language":"Japanese English | Tokyo Olympiad (東京オリンピック Tōkyō Orinpikku) is a 1965 documentary film directed by Kon Ichikawa which documents the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
