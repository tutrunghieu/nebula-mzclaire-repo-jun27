Its otherworldly scenery and costumes seem to have been inspired by fairytale illustrations, mixed with the studio-bound visual style of Hammer horror. The Hammer-like theatrical forest creates a sense of brooding claustrophobia where no sunlight can reach, accentuating Rosaleen's trapped existence. An intensely visual film, teeming with rich symbolism and imagery, the BAFTA-winning settings and special effects dominate the film, often at the expense of the (perhaps deliberately) underdeveloped characters.\"[14] | Financially, the film only just broke even on its opening weekend in the US, having been made for approximately $2 million and taking $2,234,776 in 995 theatres. However, in total, the film took over $4 million in the US[15] | Critics generally responded especially positively to the film's aesthetics. The film won one award for best film and best special effects and was nominated for four BAFTAs for costume design, make up, production design/art direction and special visual effects. | Won | Nominated","m_production":"Angela Carter, author of the original short story \"The Company of Wolves\", worked with director Neil Jordan on the script for the film. This was Carter's first experience of writing for film. However, it was also only Jordan's second feature film as director. | Whilst ultimately based upon the short story of the same name from The Bloody Chamber,[4] the plot of the film bears closer resemblance to Angela Carter's 1980 adaptation of \"The Company of Wolves\" for radio, which introduced such elements as the additional stories being told within the narrative by the characters themselves, such as Granny.[citation needed] Originally, these stories had been placed before the main narrative.[citation needed] | Carter and Jordan met in Dublin in 1982 to discuss extending Carter's radio drama adaptation of her own story, which Jordan called \"too short for a feature film\".[5] | In an L.A. Weekly interview published to correspond with the film's US debut, Jordan said: \"In a normal film you have a story with different movements that program, develop, go a little bit off the trunk, come back, and end. In this film, the different movements of the plot are actually separate stories. You start with an introduction and then move into different stories that relate to the main theme, all building to the fairy tale that everybody knows. The opening element of the dreamer gave us the freedom to move from story to story.\"[4] According to Jordan,[citation needed] it was he who suggested adding the frame story to the narrative: that of the dreaming girl Rosaleen in the modern day. This makes clear the story's focus on subconscious fears and desires. It also gives the film what Jordan called \"a Chinese box structure.\"[5] This structure was supposedly[citation needed] based upon the structure of the film The Saragossa Manuscript, which both Jordan and Carter had seen. | The script reached its third draft by July 1983.[6] | Carter's proposed ending for the film would have featured Rosaleen diving into the floor of her bedroom and being swallowed up as by water. In the DVD commentary for the film, Jordan notes that the limited technology of the time prevented the production of such a sequence, whereas later CGI effects would in fact make it quite simple.[7] The original screenplay (as presented in The Curious Room) also featured an additional story being told by the huntsman, a very different final tale by Rosaleen (reminiscent of Carter's \"Peter and the Wolf\" from her collection Black Venus) and a scene set in a church with an animal congregation.[8] | The budget was provided by ITC Distributors.[2] | The Company of Wolves was filmed in Shepperton Studios in England. The film's cast was primarily made up of British actors. Sarah Patterson made her screen debut, despite being much younger than the kind of actress the casting director had been looking for, and likely too young to understand some of the film's more adult concepts.[9] Her youth also meant having to make special arrangements with her school in order for her to be away for nine weeks while shooting took place.[9] Northern Irish actor Stephen Rea had already worked with director Neil Jordan in Angel and would later work with him again in The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles and Breakfast on Pluto, amongst others. | Jordan worked for several weeks in pre-production with artist filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson to create hundreds of detailed storyboard drawings. Also involved with production was art director/production designer Anton Furst, who would later go on to work on Tim Burton's Batman. The film's visuals were of particular importance, as Jordan explains: | The visual design was an integral part of the script. It was written and imagined with a heightened sense of reality in mind.[5] | In the DVD commentary, Jordan notes the difficulty of having to create the look of the film on a limited budget, having to create a fairytale forest out of essentially \"twelve trees\".[7] He nevertheless succeeded in creating a sunless, mystical, wondrous and claustrophobic setting saturated with fantastic elements and symbols. | The script calls for a great number of wolves to appear. Due to budgetary constraints and other factors such as cast safety, most of the 'wolves' shown in the film are in fact evidently Belgian Shepherd Dogs, mainly Terveurens and Groenendals, whose fur was specially dyed. In the DVD commentary for the film, Jordan notes the bravery of young star Sarah Patterson when acting amongst the genuine wolves.[7] Using particular light angles, the eyes of both real and \"shepherd\" wolves are made to glow dramatically in the film. | Jordan notes how Carter was \"thrilled with the process\" of making a film, as she \"had never really been involved with one.\"[5] After the film, Jordan and Carter looked for other projects which they could work on together. However, no others came to fruition, partly because of Carter's later illness. According to Jordan, he and Carter discussed a possible adaptation of Vampirella, Carter's radio play which served as the original version of her short story \"The Lady of the House of Love\" from The Bloody Chamber. This is not to be confused with the actual film Vampirella, released in 1996 and based upon the comic book character of the same name.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Neil Jordan","m_produced_by":"Chris Brown Stephen Woolley","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Angela Lansbury | David Warner | Micha Bergese | Sarah Patterson","m_music_by":"George Fenton","m_cinematography":"Bryan Loftus","m_edited_by":"Rodney Holland","m_production_company":"Palace Productions","m_distributed_by":"ITC Cannon (US)","m_release_dates":"15 September 1984 (TIFF) 21 September 1984 (UK) 19 April 1985 (US)","m_running_time":"95 min.","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£410,000[1] or £2.3 million[2]","m_box_office":"$4,389,334 (USA)[3] | The Company of Wolves is a 1984 British Gothic fantasy-horror film directed by Neil Jordan and starring Sarah Patterson, Angela Lansbury, Stephen Rea and David Warner.
