The eighth moviegoer? Fast asleep five minutes in. I've never envied a person more.\" | The film was a major box office disaster and had an extremely poor opening, at #21 with only $263,941 from 1,007 theaters, making it the 3rd worst movie opening since 1982 for films which opened in more than 600 theaters, and the worst ever at the time for films opening in over 1,000 theaters.[17][18] | David and Scott Hillenbrand were sued by their Transylmania financial backers for financial recovery in 2012.[19] These claims are rejected by the Hillenbrands. Kim Swartz, an attorney at Mitchell Silberberg representing the Hillenbrands, says in response, \"This is a completely meritless lawsuit. The plaintiffs saw the finished film numerous times before they chose to invest. In any event, David and Scott Hillenbrand and their team of top professionals did everything they could to try to get their investors a return on their investment, even to the Hillenbrands' own financial detriment, and, as stated in the Complaint, in spite of the plaintiffs' failure to provide the agreed upon P&A funds in a timely manner. The Hillenbrands look forward to having the plaintiffs' completely meritless claims dismissed and to prosecuting their own claims.\"[20] | In August, 2012, the Hillenbrands’ production company, Hill & Brand Productions 7, LLC that produced Transylmania, counter sued Third Eye Capital Corporation and Strative Capital LTD for fraud and breach of contract seeking damages of no less than $107,000,000.00 and alleging a scheme to defraud Hill & Brand Productions 7, LLC and to exploit the name and reputation of the Hillenbrands for their own financial gain.[21]","m_production":"The movie was entirely shot in Romania, Corvin Castle in 2007 and the Vgp Effects & Design was created by Vincent Guastini.[14]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Hillenbrand Scott Hillenbrand","m_produced_by":"Radu Badica Viorel Sergovici Kim Swartz Sanford Hampton Jor Van Kline","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Patrick Cavanaugh James DeBello Tony Denman Musetta Vander Jennifer Lyons Oren Skoog Paul H.
