{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for the death of her younger sister. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. | Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancers – Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \"star of the show\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \"escape\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \"a deep sacrifice\" but bring a \"perfect victory\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers. | Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines fantastic adventures that mirror the escape efforts. These adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by steampunk-inspired World War I German soldiers to gain a map (mirrored by Sweet Pea copying a map of the brothel/institution from Blue's office); storming an Orc-infested castle to retrieve two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (mirrored by Amber stealing a lighter from the mayor's pocket); and boarding a train and fighting robotic guards to disarm a bomb (mirrored by Sweet Pea stealing a kitchen knife from the Cook's belt). During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to save Sweet Pea and is killed when the bomb detonates, which is paralleled by the Cook fatally stabbing Rocket while she tries to protect her sister. | Blue overhears Blondie relaying Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming his suspicions that something is amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed. | Back in the asylum, the surgeon has just performed Babydoll's lobotomy. The surgeon is baffled by Babydoll's expression, and asks Gorski why she authorized the procedure. Gorski realizes that Blue has forged her signature and summons the police, who apprehend Blue as he attempts to sexually assault a lobotomized Babydoll. While being led away, Blue also incriminates the stepfather. Babydoll is shown smiling serenely, having apparently found freedom within her own inner \"Paradise\", with Dr. Gorski noting earlier that the girl, during her short stay, stabbed an orderly, started a fire, and helped another girl escape the asylum. | At a bus station, Sweet Pea is stopped by police as she tries to get on a bus to Fort Wayne, but she is rescued by the bus driver (the Wise Man), who misleads the police and allows her to board. Sweet Pea thanks the Driver, who tells her they have \"a long way to go\". | During the end credits, Dr. Gorski and Blue perform \"Love Is the Drug\" in a glitzy musical sequence that includes all five female leads.","m_cast":"Emily Browning as Babydoll | Abbie Cornish as Sweet Pea | Jena Malone as Rocket | Vanessa Hudgens as Blondie | Jamie Chung as Amber | Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski / Madame Vera Gorski | Oscar Isaac as Blue Jones | Jon Hamm as The Doctor / The High Roller | Scott Glenn as The Wise Man / The General / The Bus Driver | Gerard Plunkett as The Stepfather / Priest | Patrick Sabongui as Earl","m_reception":null,"m_production":"A while ago I had written a script for myself and there was a sequence in it that made me think, 'How can I make a film that can have action sequences in it that aren't limited by the physical realities that normal people are limited by, but still have the story make sense so it's not, and I don't mean to be mean, like a bullshit thing like Ultraviolet or something like that. | Sucker Punch is described by Snyder as \"Alice in Wonderland with machine guns\". The film first gained attention in March 2007. Snyder put the project aside to work on Watchmen first.[11][12] The film was co-written with Steve Shibuya, who authored the original script on which the story is based.[13][14] Snyder directed and produced with his wife and producing partner, Deborah Snyder, through their Cruel and Unusual Films banner. Wesley Coller served as executive producer.[15] | Warner Bros. announced in early 2009 that they would distribute Sucker Punch due to the success of Snyder's previous film, Watchmen.[13][16][17] \"They've never said, 'Ahh, it could have been shorter', or, 'Too bad it's so R-ish.' And that's really cool. I'm challenging them again with Sucker Punch.\"[13][16][17] In early interviews, Snyder stated that he would make Sucker Punch an R-rated film, but a later interview stated that he was aiming for it to be rated PG-13.[18] In its theatrical release, the movie was ultimately rated PG-13. Snyder cut many crucial scenes before the film's release in order to satisfy the MPAA's censors, but claimed that the home media release of the film will be a director's cut and closer to his original vision.[19] | When Snyder was in San Diego hosting a Blu-ray live screening of Watchmen for Comic-Con, he handed out T-shirts for Sucker Punch featuring the first art for the film. The art was designed by Alex Pardee of Snafu Comics,[20] with title art work by Los Angeles graffiti artist Galo Canote. Pre-production began in June 2009 in Canada. Snyder had also added that he enjoyed the freedom of filming his own original script.[21] Photographer Clay Enos was hired to take still pictures on set and to take portraits of the main actors.[22] | Before casting started in March 2009,[23] Snyder revealed his ideal cast for the feature film.[24] He chose to go with an all-female cast in this film saying that \"I already did the all-male cast with 300, so I'm doing the opposite end of the spectrum.\"[25][26][27] | Snyder had tapped Amanda Seyfried first for the lead role, Babydoll.[23] When asked if Seyfried was up for the role, Snyder said, \"We'll see. We're trying to, so ... She's great. It would be great if it worked out\".[28][29][30] Snyder had also offered roles to Abbie Cornish, Evan Rachel Wood, Emma Stone, and Vanessa Hudgens.[31] However, Seyfried turned it down due to a conflict in schedule with her HBO series Big Love.[32] Browning agreed to replace Seyfried in the role. During the confirmation of her involvement, Hudgens, Wood, Cornish, and Stone were all still in talks.[33] | Wood dropped out of the project due to scheduling conflicts with her recurring role in HBO's True Blood and her stage production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[34] She was later replaced by Malone for the role of \"Rocket\".[35] Chung was signed up to play \"Amber\"; Emma Stone had been offered the part but declined due schedule conflict with her film Easy A.[36][37] Freida Pinto was also considered for the role of \"Amber\" before it went to Jamie Chung. Gugino, who was cast as \"Madam Gorski\", a psychiatrist in the asylum, previously worked with Snyder on Watchmen.[38] Hamm was confirmed in late August 2009 to play \"The High Roller\". Isaac was also tapped at around the same time.[39][40][41] Snyder confirmed that Glenn agreed to be involved in the project, portraying \"The Wise Man\".[42] | Prior to filming, the cast had twelve weeks of training and fight evaluations, beginning in June 2009 in Los Angeles and continuing through filming. The leads in the film were taught to deadlift up to 250 pounds (110 kg) for their roles. Damon Caro, the stunt coordinator and fight choreographer from 300 and Watchmen, Snyder's previous films, was hired for the action design, stunt training and fight choreography for the movie.[43][44] The other cast members started training without Hudgens while she was involved with other projects, including Beastly.[45] Abbie Cornish said that the rest of the cast were training six hours a day, five days a week in martial arts, swords and empty hand choreography.[46] Snyder said that when the girls are fighting, \"[like] they're on their way to kill a baby dragon, they've killed all of these orc-like creatures and they're entering a door [and] it's this classic, real Navy SEAL style room clearing. They have machine guns but they're fighting mythic creatures, impossible creatures. The hand to hand stuff is all brutal, because Damon [Caro] did all the [fights] in Bourne and it has that vibe to it.\"[47] Snyder remarks that in the girls' imaginations \"they can do anything\".[48] | Pre-production began in Los Angeles in June 2009 then moved to Vancouver in July. Principal photography began in September 2009 in Vancouver, and concluded in January 2010. With an $82 million budget,[49] post-production began in September 2009 and was expected to last until January 2010 in Vancouver and Toronto.[6][50] Originally, production would have started in June 2009, but it was postponed.[51] Production concluded on January 22, 2010.[52] Snyder confirmed that prior to the set production date, he already shot some fantasy sequences for Sucker Punch.[21] Snyder said the film is a \"stylized motion picture about action and sort of landscapes of the imagination and things of that nature\". Snyder had also been decided on the film's title for some time, stating it is a pop-culture reference. \"It's about hopefully what the movie feels like when you watch it, more than a specific 'Oh, it's a story of this person.' It's all stylized.\"[53] | The film includes an imaginary brothel that the five girls enter in the alternate reality, where singing and dancing take place. The fantasy sequences include dragons, aliens, and a World War I battle. Snyder expressed his interest in the film's content: | On the other hand, though it's fetishistic and personal, I like to think that my fetishes aren't that obscure. Who doesn't want to see girls running down the trenches of World War One wreaking havoc? I'd always had an interest in those worlds – comic books, fantasy art, animated films. I'd like to see this, that's how I approach everything, and then keep pushing it from there.[54] | Rick Carter served as production designer[55] while the visual effects of the film were done by Animal Logic with 75 visual effects specialists, and the Moving Picture Company (MPC) who were awarded over 120 shots.[56] Sucker Punch operates on three levels – a reality, then a sub-reality where the psych ward world shifts into a strange high-roller's brothel. The final level is made up of a dream world where more action sequences that are removed from time and space take place.[46] Warner Bros. announced earlier that Sucker Punch would be released in 3D format.[57] Snyder describes the conversion into 3D as a completely different process.[58] However, it was later announced that the film would not be presented in 3D. Snyder filmed a \"Maximum Movie Mode\" interactive Blu-ray commentary for the film's home media release.[59] | Snyder wanted to design the film as something with no limits, considering that he co-wrote the script from an original idea. He added that he wanted it to \"be a cool story and not just like a video game where you're just loose and going nuts.\"[60] Snyder also noted the influence of Asian iconography, particularly Japanese elements such as samurai, anime, and mecha.[61] | The title Sucker Punch is not explained in the film. Snyder has said that there are two meanings:[62] | There's a mechanism in the movie that sneaks up on you. We sort of plant the seed of this thing, and then at the end of the movie it kind of comes back around. I think that in some ways, that's what the sucker punch is. But also you, the audience, have like a preconceived idea when you look at Babydoll. You think she's innocent and sweet, that she's capable of only a certain amount of things. But I think that's a mistake. So that has something to do with the title, too. | Andrew O'Hehir, writing in Salon, sees the film's title as its essential theme:[63] | If you want to understand Snyder's central narrative gambit, it's right there in the title. He gives us what we want (or what we think we want, or what he thinks we think we want): Absurdly fetishized women in teeny little skirts, gloriously repetitious fight sequences loaded with plot coupons, pseudo-feminist fantasies of escape and revenge. Then he yanks it all back and stabs us through the eyeball. | Snyder has stated one interpretation of the film is that it is a critique on geek culture's sexism and objectification of women.[19]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Zack Snyder","m_produced_by":"Deborah Snyder | Zack Snyder","m_screenplay_by":"Zack Snyder | Steve Shibuya","m_story_by":"Zack Snyder","m_starring":"Emily Browning | Abbie Cornish | Jena Malone | Vanessa Hudgens | Jamie Chung | Carla Gugino | Oscar Isaac | Jon Hamm | Scott Glenn","m_music_by":"Tyler Bates | Marius de Vries","m_cinematography":"Larry Fong","m_edited_by":"William Hoy","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

It is Snyder's first film based on an original concept.[4][5] The film stars Emily Browning,[6] as a young woman who is committed to a mental institution. In order to cope, she envisions the asylum as a brothel and teams up with four dancers/prisoners to escape before she undergoes a lobotomy. As she collects the items she needs to escape, she enters another level of fantasy, in which the women become strong, experienced warriors. | Each fantasy is a parallel to the events in the brothel. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung portray the four prisoners imagined as dancers by Babydoll. Carla Gugino plays Dr. Vera Gorski, a psychiatrist who, in Babydoll's mind, is known as Madame Gorski, a choreographer at the strip club. Oscar Isaac plays Blue Jones, the asylum's orderly, who in Babydoll's mind, is the corrupt owner of the brothel. | The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres in the United States at midnight on March 25, 2011.[7] The film was negatively received by critics and under-performed at the box office.[8] |  | ","m_marketing":"Sucker Punch participated in the Comic-Con 2010 and showed the first footage of the film, featuring the songs \"Prologue\" by Immediate Music and \"The Crablouse\" by Lords of Acid. The trailer was released on July 27 on Apple Trailers. The second official trailer was released on November 3 and was attached to Due Date, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, and Black Swan.[58] On February 15, Titan Books released the official \"Art of the Film\" book full of pictures, to mark the film's release in the following month. | The film received a PG-13 rating. To avoid an R rating, a sex scene was cut. Browning said, \"I had a very tame and mild love scene with Jon Hamm ... I think it's great for this young girl to actually take control of her own sexuality.\" She added, \"[The MPAA] got Zack to edit the scene and make it look less like she's into it. Zack said he edited it down to the point where it looked like he was taking advantage of her. That's the only way he could get a PG-13 [rating] and he said, 'I don't want to send that message.'\"[72] | In the United Kingdom, the film received a 12A certificate for \"moderate violence, threat, language and sexual references\". The film was passed with no additional cuts required.[1] The extended director's cut was given a 12.","m_reference":"^ a b \"SUCKER PUNCH (12A)\". British Board of Film Classification.
