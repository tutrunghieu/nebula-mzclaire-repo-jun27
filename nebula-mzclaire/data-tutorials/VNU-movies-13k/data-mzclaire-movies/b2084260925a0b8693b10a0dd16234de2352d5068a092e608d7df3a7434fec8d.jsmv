{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Benjamin (Chestnut) is an aspiring songwriter who attempts to break into the music business by giving a copy of his recording track of a Christmas album to a rap artist named J-Jizzy (Charles Q. Murphy). Nancy (Union) is a divorced mother, who is too busy taking care of her three children to take care of herself. Her daughter Emily (Khail Bryant) overhears her mother say that she wished for a compliment from a man, and the daughter tells the local mall's Santa Claus about her mother's wish. | The Santa Claus turns out to be Benjamin, who notices Nancy. Later, while sitting in a Starbucks after his shift as Santa, Benjamin and his friend Jamal (Faizon Love) see Nancy go into a dry cleaners. Benjamin borrows Jamal's jacket, pretends to drop it off at the cleaners, tells Nancy that she's a very attractive woman (granting her wish), and leaves. Eventually, the two start to date and end up falling in love—without Ben realizing that Nancy's ex-husband is J-Jizzy. | Things take a turn for the worse, however, because Nancy's oldest son, John-John (Malik Hammond) is jealous of Benjamin going out with his mother and plots to break up the relationship. What follows is a series of funny and touching scenes that show viewers what \"family\" is really about. | Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard play omniscient roles in the movie. Howard is a mischievous and sly angel named \"Bah Humbug\", while Latifah is the kind, thoughtful angel, called \"Mrs. Christmas\".","m_cast":"Gabrielle Union - Nancy Taylor | Morris Chestnut - Benjamin Armstrong | Charlie Murphy - J-Jizzy | Malik Hammond - John-John Taylor | Jeremy Gumbs - Mikey Taylor | Khail Bryant - Emily Taylor | Faizon Love - Jamal | Jill Marie Jones - Robin | Katt Williams - Delicious | Queen Latifah - Mrs. Christmas | Rachel True - Brenda | Terrence Howard - Bah Humbug","m_reception":"The film was neither a critical nor commercial success.
