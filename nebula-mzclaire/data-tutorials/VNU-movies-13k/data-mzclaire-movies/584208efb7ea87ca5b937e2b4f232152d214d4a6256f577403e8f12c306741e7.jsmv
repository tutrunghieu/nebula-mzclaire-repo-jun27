{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Continuing seventeen years after Arcand's The Decline of the American Empire, the film centres on an exploration of the characters first met in the original film and their children, newly introduced. The older generation are still largely social-democrats and proponents of Quebec nationalism, but both political and economic developments after the “Quiet Revolution” of the 1960s, as well as their own aging, make their left-wing stance seem somewhat anachronistic. | The plot revolves around the character Rémy's battle with terminal cancer, and the efforts of Sébastien, his estranged son to make his dying father more comfortable in his last days. Finally the father and son travel to Vermont in the United States to receive medical care. | Sébastien, at the request of Rémy's ex-wife Louise, has reluctantly returned from London where he has a successful career in quantitative finance - anathema to his father's socialist persuasions. However, this background helps Sébastien to navigate and manipulate Quebec's healthcare system (portrayed as somewhat overloaded in the film) to secure better care for his father. In the process, he also gathers the various other friends and family members from Rémy's past who come to visit and comfort him. During Rémy's last days, he and his friends travel to the cottage of the first film, and discuss philosophy, politics, and past sexual and intellectual exploits.","m_cast":"Rémy Girard as Rémy | Stéphane Rousseau as Sébastien | Dorothée Berryman as Louise | Louise Portal as Diane | Marie-Josée Croze as Nathalie | Marina Hands as Gaëlle | Dominique Michel as Dominique | Pierre Curzi as Pierre | Yves Jacques as Claude | Isabelle Blais as Sylvaine | Toni Cecchinato as Alessandro | Sophie Lorain as First Lover | Mitsou Gélinas as Ghislaine | Micheline Lanctôt as Nurse Carole | Johanne-Marie Tremblay as Sister Constance | Roy Dupuis as Narcotics Officer Gilles Levac","m_reception":"The Barbarian Invasions has received positive reviews from numerous critics.
