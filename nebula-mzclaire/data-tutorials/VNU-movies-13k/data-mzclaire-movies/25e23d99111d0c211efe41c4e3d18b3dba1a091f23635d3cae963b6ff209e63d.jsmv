{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in London and the south of England in 1929, the story finds Nicholas, Duc de Richleau (Christopher Lee), investigating the strange actions of the son of a friend, Simon Aron (Patrick Mower), who has a house replete with strange markings and a pentagram. He quickly deduces that Simon is involved with the occult. Nicholas de Richleau and Rex Van Ryn (Leon Greene) manage to rescue Simon and another young initiate, Tanith (Niké Arrighi), from a devil-worshipping cult. During the rescue, they disrupt a ceremony on Salisbury Plain, in which the Devil (Baphomet) himself appears. | They escape to the home of the Eatons, friends of Richleau and Van Ryn, and are followed by the group's leader, Mocata (Charles Gray), who has a psychic connection to the two initiates. After visiting the house to discuss the matter and an unsuccessful attempt to influence the initiates to return, Mocata forces Richleau and the other occupants to defend themselves through a night of black magic attacks, ending with the conjuring of the angel of death. Richleau is able to repel the angel, but it kills Tanith instead (as once summoned, it must take a life). His attacks defeated, Mocata kidnaps the Eatons' young daughter Peggy (Rosalyn Landor). The Duc has Tanith's spirit possess Peggy's mother in order to find Mocata, but they are only able to get a single clue, from which Rex realizes that the cultists are at a house he visited earlier. | Simon tries to rescue Peggy on his own, but is recaptured by the cult. The Duc, Richard, and Peggy's family, also try to rescue her, but they are defeated by Mocata. Suddenly, a powerful force (or Tanith herself) begins ruling Mrs. Eaton (Sarah Lawson) and puts a stop to Peggy's trance. She then leads Peggy in the recitation of a spell, which kills all of the cultists and transforms their coven room into a church. When the Duc and his companions awaken, they discover that the spell Peggy was led into casting has reversed time and changed the future in their favour. | Simon and Tanith have survived, while Mocata's spell to conjure the angel of death has been reflected back on him. Now, he pays the price of loss of life and eternal damnation of his soul for having wrongly summoned the angel of death. Nicholas de Richleau comments that it is God to whom they must be thankful.","m_cast":"Christopher Lee – Nicholas, Duc de Richleau | Charles Gray – Mocata | Niké Arrighi – Tanith Carlisle | Leon Greene – Rex Van Ryn (dubbed by Patrick Allen) | Patrick Mower – Simon Aron | Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies – Countess | Sarah Lawson – Marie Eaton | Paul Eddington – Richard Eaton | Rosalyn Landor – Peggy Eaton | Russell Waters – Malin | Eddie Powell – The Goat of Mendes (uncredited) | John Bown – Receptionist | Yemi Ajibade – African | Ahmed Khalil – Indian | Zoe Starr – Indian girl | Willie Payne – Servant | Keith Pyott – Max | Mohan Singh – Mocata's servant | Liane Aukin – Satanist | John Falconer – Satanist | Anne Godley – Satanist | Richard Scott – Satanist | Peter Swanwick – Satanist | Bert Vivian – Satanist | John Brown | Richard Huggett","m_reception":"Reviews of the film have been widely favorable. It currently has a 93% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[5] | [The film] sustains flavor and atmosphere in beautiful color photography[...]. Under Terence Fisher's direction [...] the first 20 minutes are dandy, as a steely aristocrat, played with suave dignity by Christopher Lee, tries to outwit the evil ones[...]. This civilized counterattack [...] and some realistic dialogue, steady the action until a flaring, flapping climax[...]. Aside from Mr. Lee, the acting [...] is much too broad. Still, [...] \"The Devil's Bride\" does hold together, and superstitious moviegoers could do a lot worse.[6] | Director Terence Fisher has a ball with this slice of black magic, based on the Dennis Wheatley novel. He has built up a suspenseful pic, with several tough highlights, and gets major effect by playing the subject dead straight and getting similar serious performances from his capable cast.
