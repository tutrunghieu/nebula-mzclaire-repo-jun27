TV guide describes the film as a \"Sporadically interesting heist film\".[1] | A specially arranged premiere of the film at Lake Havasu's movie theater in 1971 was greeted with a muted response from Havasu locals, who were shocked at the gritty, low budget appearance of the film. | More recently, the film has achieved minor cult status (see below) with its increasing availability.","m_production":"Production preparation began in January 1971 with notices placed in the Havasu Herald newspaper announcing the production and auditions. Grofe and production manager Peter MacGregor Scott visited Lake Havasu to audition locals for roles in the movie and also scout locations with the assistance of Lake Havasu Theater Guild president Floyd Hamilton. Havasu High School student Steve Manone auditioned and was chosen for the role of the Police Chief's son. | Production began mid February 1971. The first weekend's filming was at the deserted, now historic sites, of Swansea mining town and at Planet Ranch (see below), with all the actors cast as \"wolves\" present. | Richard Egan and Martha Hyer arrived in the second week of production. Egan, whose career by then was on the wane, had been persuaded to take the role on a deferred compensation by personal plea from Grofe. Jan Murray and Rick Jason played the roles of Wolf #1 and Wolf #4. Jan Murray was famous as a comedian and TV show celebrity, Rick Jason as the star of the popular television show Combat!. Jason, impressed with Grofe's ability to produce a film on a relatively tiny budget, would later use most of the same crew to film his own directorial debut Deja Vu in Hong Kong. | Frank Sinatra's protege Frankie Randall was working with Jan Murray in Las Vegas prior to production and Murray suggested he take a role in the film. Martha Hyer, married to Hollywood titan Hal Wallis, was made available by her agent for this production for the relatively small sum of a few thousand dollars. Zaldy Zshornack was included in the cast by an arrangement with Philippines producer Cirio Santiago in a deal which provided Zshornack's services plus ten thousand dollars in return for the Philippine distribution rights of the finished film. Smokey Roberds, Henry Capps, and Andre Marquis had worked with Grofe on his 1968 Chuck Connors action pic The Proud, Damned and Dead.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Ferde Grofe Jr.","m_produced_by":"Ferde Grofe Jr.","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Richard Egan Martha Hyer Jan Murray Rick Jason Frankie Randall Smokey Roberds Andre Marquis Zaldy Zshornack Henry Capps","m_music_by":"Sean Bonniwell","m_cinematography":"Ric Waite","m_edited_by":"Tony Di Marco","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Gold Key Entertainment","m_release_dates":"November 1971 (1971-11) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"92 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$187,000 | The Day of the Wolves is a 1971 heist movie starring Richard Egan and directed, written and produced by Ferde Grofe Jr. the son of the renowned composer who had previously worked in the Philippine film industry.
