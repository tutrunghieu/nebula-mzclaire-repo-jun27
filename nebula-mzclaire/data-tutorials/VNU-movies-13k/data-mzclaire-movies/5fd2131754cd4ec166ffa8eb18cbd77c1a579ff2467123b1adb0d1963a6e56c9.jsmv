As the plot begins to unfold, Philip has just brought home a snake from a local importer, unaware that his new pet has been accidentally switched with a deadly black mamba destined for a toxicology lab. The lab reports the mix-up, and a police officer is dispatched to the Hopkins residence, only to be shot by the panicking chauffeur. The London townhouse is surrounded by police, trapping the criminals, the child, and his grandfather inside with the mamba, which is now loose in the ventilation system.","m_cast":"Klaus Kinski as Jacques Müller (Jacmel) | Sterling Hayden as Howard Anderson | Sarah Miles as Dr. Marion Stowe | Nicol Williamson as Cmdr.

In his autobiography, Kinski Uncut, he also stated that the script for the Spielberg movie was \"moronically shitty\".[3] | Haggard later recalled: | I took over that at very short notice. Tobe Hooper had been directing it and they had stopped for whatever reason. It hadn’t been working. I did see some of his stuff and it didn’t look particularly good plus he also had some sort of nervous breakdown or something. So anyway they stopped shooting and offered it to me. Unfortunately I had commitments, I had some commercials to shoot. But anyway I took it over with barely ten days of preparation - which shows. It doesn’t become my picture, it’s a bit inbetween... [Oliver Reed was] scary at first because he was always testing you all the time. Difficult but not as difficult as Klaus Kinski. Because Oliver actually had a sense of humour. I was rather find [sic] of him; he could be tricky but he was quite warm really. He just played games and was rather macho and so on. Klaus Kinski was very cold. The main problem with the film was that the two didn’t get on and they fought like cats. Kinski of course is a fabulous film actor and he’s good in the part, the part suits him very well. They were both well cast but it was a very unhappy film. I think Klaus was the problem but then Oliver spent half the movie just trying to rub him up, pulling his leg all the way. There were shouting matches because Oliver just wouldn’t let up. None of this is about art. All the things that you’re trying to concentrate on tend to slip. So it was not a happy period.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Venom  by Alan Scholefield","m_directed_by":"Piers Haggard","m_produced_by":"Martin Bregman","m_screenplay_by":"Robert Carrington","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Klaus Kinski | Sterling Hayden | Sarah Miles | Nicol Williamson | Cornelia Sharpe | Susan George | Lance Holcomb | Oliver Reed","m_music_by":"Michael Kamen","m_cinematography":"Denys Coop | Gilbert Taylor","m_edited_by":"Michael Bradsell","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"HandMade Films (UK) | Paramount Pictures (US)","m_release_dates":"28 November 1981 (1981-11-28) (Japan) | 19 January 1982 (1982-01-19) (United Kingdom) | 29 January 1982 (1982-01-29) (United States) |  | ","m_running_time":"92 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$5.2 million[2] | Venom is a 1981 British horror film directed by Piers Haggard, written by Robert Carrington, based on Alan Scholefield's novel of the same name, and starring Klaus Kinski, Oliver Reed, Nicol Williamson, and Sarah Miles. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"VENOM (AA)\".
