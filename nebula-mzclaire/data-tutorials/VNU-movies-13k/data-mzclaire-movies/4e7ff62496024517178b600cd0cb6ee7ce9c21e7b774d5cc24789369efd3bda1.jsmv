{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in a world where toys are shown to be living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, the film focus on the toys of a six-year-old boy Andy Davis (John Morris). His favorite toy is an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks). Woody is the head of the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney). Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly, are planning to relocate the following week and have Andy's birthday early, much to the shock of the toys when Woody finds out, but Woody tries to be optimistic. He sends little green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), to survey the presents and tell the toys about it via a radio. Pretty soon, Andy gains a surprise present, which is revealed to be an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. | Everybody is amazed at Buzz and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. When Andy and his mother decide to go to Pizza Planet for supper, Woody tries to get Buzz discarded behind the shelf, but his plan backfires and Buzz is thrown out the window by mistake. Some of the other toys, mainly Potato Head and Hamm begin to accuse Woody of murdering Buzz out of envy, but Woody is saved when Andy decides to take him to Pizza Planet after failing to find Buzz. Buzz, thinking too that Woody tried to murder him, confronts Woody and they soon fight, which leaves them out on the street, until they find a car heading to Pizza Planet and stow away in it. However, at Pizza Planet, Buzz's delusion and still believing that he is a real space ranger leads them to eventually be captured by Andy's destructive toy killing neighbor Sid Phillips (Erik von Detten). | When attempting to escape from Sid's house, Buzz soon learns the truth about being a toy and sinks into despondence, which causes Woody's attempt to have Andy's toys help them escape fail. Sid comes into his room with a large rocket and decides to blow up Buzz, but is forced to delay it to the morning (the day of Andy's move) when a storm happens. Woody convinces Buzz to get over being a toy as Andy loves him for that. Buzz's confidence is renewed, but before the duo can escape, Sid puts his plan into action. Woody recruits Sid's mutant toys that he created and abused to help him rescue Buzz and he and they soon manage to frighten Sid into stop abusing toys. | The duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives a chase with Buzz at his mercy. Woody breaks into the moving van and uses RC, a remote control car that he used to push Buzz over the shelf earlier, to save Buzz, but the other toys think he is trying to murder another toy and throw him off the truck. Regardless, Scud gets trapped in a traffic pile and Buzz and Woody use RC to catch up to the truck where the toys, remorseful after discovering that Buzz was alive all along, try to help Woody and Buzz on the ramp, but fail. So the duo decide to use the rocket to catch up, but it goes out of control, but Buzz manages to free and fly them to Andy's car. | During Christmas at the Davis family's new residence, the reconciled toys listen to Andy open his Christmas gifts as Buzz and Woody are now the best of friends.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 9/10 based on 78 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Entertaining as it is innovative, Toy Story reinvigorated animation while heralding the arrival of Pixar as a family-friendly force to be reckoned with.\"[9] At the website Metacritic, which uses a normalized rating system, the film earned a \"universal acclaim\" level rating of 92/100 based on 16 reviews by mainstream critics.[8] Reviewers hailed the film for its creative computer animation, voice cast, and ability to appeal to numerous age groups. | Leonard Klady of Variety commended the animation's \"... razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look and that \"the camera loops and zooms in a dizzying fashion that fairly takes one's breath away.\"[92] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared the film's innovative animation to Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, saying that \"both movies take apart the universe of cinematic visuals, and put it back together again, allowing us to see in a new way.\"[93] Due to the film's creative animation, Richard Corliss of TIME claimed that it was \"... the year's most inventive comedy.\"[94] | The voice cast was also praised by various critics. Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today approved of the selection of Hanks and Allen for the lead roles.[95] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that \"Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, Toy Story is one of the best voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... making their presences strongly felt.\"[96] Several critics also recognized the film's ability to appeal to various age groups, specifically children and adults.[93][97] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote \"It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatest children's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids.\"[98] | In 1995, Toy Story was ranked eighth in TIME' s list of the \"Best 10 films of 1995\".[99] In 2011, TIME named it one of the \"25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\".[100] It also ranks at number 99 in Empire magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\" and as the highest ranked animated movie.[101] | In 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the greatest animated film of all time.[102] In 2007, the Visual Effects Society named the film 22nd in its list of the \"Top 50 Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time\".[103] In 2005 (ten years after its theatrical release), the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, one of five films to be selected in its first year of eligibility.[104] The film is ranked 99th on the AFI's list of the \"100 greatest American Films of All-Time\".[105][106][107] It was one of only two animated films on that list, with the other being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). It was also sixth best in the animation genre on AFI's 10 Top 10. | Director Terry Gilliam would praise the film as \"a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period.\"[108] | Before the film's release, executive producer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs stated \"If Toy Story is a modest hit—say $75 million at the box office—we'll [Pixar and Disney] both break even. If it gets $100 million, we'll both make money. But if it's a real blockbuster and earns $200 million or so at the box office, we'll make good money, and Disney will make a lot of money.\" Upon its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350 million worldwide.[61] Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated \"I don't think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve. Believe me, when we first agreed to work together, we never thought their first movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the strength of it.\"[61] The film's first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend), earned it $39,071,176.[109] The film placed first in the weekend's box office with $29,140,617.[3] The film maintained its No. 1 position at the domestic box office for the following two weekends. Toy Story was the highest-grossing domestic film in 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld and GoldenEye.[110] At the time of its release, it was the third highest-grossing animated film after The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992).[25] When not considering inflation, Toy Story is No. 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of all time.[111] The film had gross receipts of $191,796,233 in the U.S. and Canada and $170,162,503 in international markets for a total of $361,958,736 worldwide.[3] At the time of its release, the film ranked as 17th highest-grossing film (unadjusted) domestically, and worldwide it was the 21st highest-grossing film. | The film won and was nominated for various other awards including a Kids' Choice Award, MTV Movie Award, and a British Academy Film Award, among others. John Lasseter received an Academy Special Achievement Award in 1996 \"for the development and inspired application of techniques that have made possible the first feature-length computer-animated film.\"[112] Additionally, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, two to Randy Newman for Best Music—Original Song, for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Music—Original Musical or Comedy Score.[113] It was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay for the work by Joel Cohen, Pete Docter, John Lasseter, Joe Ranft, Alec Sokolow, Andrew Stanton and Joss Whedon, making Toy Story the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award writing category.[113] | Toy Story won eight Annie Awards, including \"Best Animated Feature\". Animator Pete Docter, director John Lasseter, musician Randy Newman, producers Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, production designer Ralph Eggleston, and writers Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, Andrew Stanton, and Joss Whedon all won awards for \"Best Individual Achievement\" in their respective fields for their work on the film. The film also won \"Best Individual Achievement\" in technical achievement.[114] | Toy Story was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, one for Best Motion Picture—Comedy or Musical, and one for Best Original Song—Motion Picture for Newman's \"You've Got a Friend in Me\".[115] At both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, the film won \"Best Animated Film\".[116][117] Toy Story is also among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14, and the highest-placed (at No. 99) animated film in Empire magazine's list of \"500 Greatest Movie of All Time\".[118] In 2005, Toy Story, along with Toy Story 2 was voted the 4th greatest cartoon in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Cartoons poll, behind The Simpsons, Tom and Jerry and South Park.","m_production":"Director John Lasseter's first experience with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends showed him the lightcycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation.[14] Lasseter tried to pitch the idea of a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired. He then went on to work at Lucasfilm and later as a founding member of Pixar, which was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs in 1986.[15] At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities, and Tin Toy (1988) —a short told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys— would go on to claim the 1988 Academy Award for animated short films, the first computer-generated film to do so.[16] | Tin Toy gained Disney's attention, and the new team at The Walt Disney Company—CEO Michael Eisner and chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division —began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.[16] Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull, \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"[16] Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.[16] Disney had always made all their movies in-house, and refused to change this. But when Tim Burton, who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.[17] | Both sides were willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted to produce a computer-animated feature.[18] In addition, Disney had licensed Pixar's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and that made it the largest customer for Pixar's computers.[19] Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, it was not the other way around: \"We want to do a film with you,\" said Jobs. \"That would make us happy.\"[19] At this same time, Peter Schneider, president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, was potentially interested in making a feature film with Pixar.[18] When Catmull, Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Schneider in the summer of 1990, they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious. They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.[20] After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and were surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called A Tin Toy Christmas. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.[21] | They met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the Team Disney building at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank.[21] Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.[21] Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I am a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"[19] He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"[19][21] He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators—\"ask them anything at all\"—and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.[22] Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.[19] Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.[22] In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.[19] Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.[23] Eventually the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.[24][25] It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations would become a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.[19] | An agreement to produce a feature film based on Tin Toy with a working title of Toy Story was finalized and production began soon thereafter.[26] | The original treatment for Toy Story, drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, had little in common with the eventual finished film.[4] It paired Tinny, the one-man band from Tin Toy with a ventriloquist's dummy and sent them on a sprawling odyssey. Under studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg, Woody was the main villain, abusing the other toys until they rallied against him; however after Disney executive saw the storyboards they relinquished creative control to Pixar.[27] The core idea of Toy Story was present from the treatment onward, however: that \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions.\"[4] Katzenberg felt the original treatment was problematic and told Lasseter to reshape Toy Story as more of an odd-couple buddy picture, and suggested they watch some classic buddy movies, such as The Defiant Ones and 48 Hrs., in which two characters with different attitudes are thrown together and have to bond.[28][29] Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter emerged in early September 1991 with the second treatment, and although the lead characters were still Tinny and the dummy, the outline of the final film was beginning to take shape.[28] | The script went through many changes before the final version. Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\", and the character was changed to a military action figure, and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut Buzz Aldrin).[30] Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by Apollo astronauts as well as G.I. Joe action figures. In addition, the green and purple color scheme on Lightyear's suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, whose favorite colors were green and purple respectively.[31][32] Woody, the second character, was inspired by a Casper the Friendly Ghost doll that Lasseter had when he was a child. Originally, Woody was a ventriloquist's dummy with a pull-string (hence the name Woody). However, character designer Bud Luckey suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy. John Lasseter liked the contrast between the Western and the science fiction genres and the character immediately changed. Eventually all the ventriloquist dummy aspects of the character were deleted, because the dummy was designed to look \"sneaky and mean.\"[33] However they kept the name Woody to pay homage to the Western actor Woody Strode.[30] The story department drew inspiration from films such as Midnight Run and The Odd Couple,[34] and Lasseter screened Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky (1986) for further influence. | Toy Story's script was strongly influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware that most of them were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior.[33] Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems.[35] Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie.[36] The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.[37] | Katzenberg gave approval for the script on January 19, 1993, at which point voice casting could begin.[38] Lasseter always wanted Tom Hanks to play the character of Woody. Lasseter claimed Hanks \"has the ability to take emotions and make them appealing. Even if the character, like the one in A League of Their Own, is down-and-out and despicable.\"[38] Paul Newman was considered for the role of Woody, although Newman subsequently accepted the role of Doc Hudson in another Pixar success, Cars.[39] Billy Crystal was approached to play Buzz, but turned down the role, which he later regretted, and subsequently accepted the role of Mike Wazowski in another Pixar success, Monsters, Inc..[40][41] In addition to Crystal, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Jim Carrey were also considered for Buzz.[42][43][44][45][46] Lasseter took the role to Tim Allen, who was appearing in Disney's Home Improvement, and he accepted.[47] | To gauge how an actor's voice would fit with a character, Lasseter borrowed a common Disney technique: animate a vocal monologue from a well-established actor to meld the actor's voice with the appearance or actions of the animated character.[36] This early test footage, using Hanks' voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks to sign on to the film.[38][48] Toy Story was both Hanks and Allen's first animated film role.[49] | Every couple of weeks, Lasseter and his team would put together their latest set of storyboards or footage to show Disney. In early screen tests, Pixar impressed Disney with the technical innovation but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each presentation by Pixar, Katzenberg would tear much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg's big push was to add more edginess to the two main characters.[29] Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and asked for adult references to be added to the film.[38] After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney execs, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm.[29][47] Tom Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.[29] Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993, an event they later dubbed \"The Black Friday Incident.\"[6][38] The results were disastrous, and Schneider, who was never particularly enamored of Katzenberg's idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney, declared it a mess and ordered that production be stopped immediately.[50] Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad. Schumacher replied bluntly: \"Because it's not their movie anymore, it's completely not the movie that John set out to make.\"[6] | Lasseter was embarrassed with what was on the screen, later recalling, \"It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I've ever seen.\" He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive.[6] Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.[51] Schneider had initially wanted to shutdown production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.[52] Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counsel from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.[28] Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.[51] When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.[6] | The Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody morphed from being a tyrannical boss of Andy's other toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than a juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed slightly \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy.\"[52] Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach, and by February 1994 the film was back in production.[6] The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.[38] When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.[5][53] In comparison, The Lion King, released in 1994, required a budget of $45 million and a staff of 800.[5] In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget was proving inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film right, and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns. Katzenberg was not willing, and Ed Catmull, described[by whom?] as \"more diplomatic than Jobs,\" was able to reach a compromise.[6] | We couldn't have made this movie in traditional animation. This is a story that can only really be told with three-dimensional toy characters. ... Some of the shots in this film are so beautiful. | Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; the magnet for talent was not the pay, generally mediocre, but rather the allure of taking part in the first computer-animated feature.[53] Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film \"We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"[38] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design.[55] Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.[55] Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.[38][56] The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.[33] | Every shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.[57] Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.[57] Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, each shot went to the animation department from layout. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.[57] The animators used the Menv program to set each character in a desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"keyframes\") was created, the software would build poses for the frames in-between.[58] The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.[58] To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.[55] | Afterward, the animators would compile the scenes, and develop a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.[55][56] Under Tom Porter, the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in Toy Story came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.[59] Under Galyn Susman and Sharon Calahan, the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 Sun Microsystems computers that ran 24 hours a day.[37] Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.[60] Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.[38][55][61] There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.[57] A camera team, aided by David DiFrancesco, recorded the frames onto film stock. Toy Story was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.[37] During post-production, the film was sent to Skywalker Sound, where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.[56] | Disney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a buddy film featuring \"real toys.\" Joss Whedon agreed saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"[38] However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"[38] Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in Toy Story would not break into song, but the film would use songs over the action, as in The Graduate, to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.[36] Disney and Lasseter tapped Randy Newman to compose the film. The edited Toy Story was due to Newman and Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.[62] | Lasseter claimed \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"[38] Newman developed the film's signature song \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" in one day.[38] | It was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process, when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.[60] Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.[60] According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point.[63] Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.[63] Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.[64] | Sources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar.[6][64] However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.[6] As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.[6] A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.[62] The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.[62]","m_sequel":"Toy Story has spawned three sequels: Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Toy Story 4, to be released in 2018. Initially, the first sequel to Toy Story was going to be a direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996.[127] However, after the cast from Toy Story returned and the story was considered to be better than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel would see a theatrical release.[128] Toy Story's first sequel Toy Story 2 was released in theatres November 24, 1999 and saw the return of the majority of the voice cast from Toy Story, and the film focuses on Andy's toys going to rescue Woody after he is stolen at a yard sale by a greedy toy collector voiced by Wayne Knight. The film was equally well received by critics, many of whom thought it was even better than the first installment, earning a rare 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews.[129] At Metacritic, the film earned a favorable rating of 88/100 based on 34 reviews.[130] The film's widest release was 3,257 theaters and it grossed $485,015,179 worldwide, becoming the second-most successful animated film after The Lion King at the time of its release.[131][132] | The second sequel Toy Story 3 was released in theatres June 18, 2010 and centers on Andy's toys being accidentally donated to a day-care center when Andy, now a teenager, is preparing to go to college.[133][134] Again, the majority of the cast from the prior two films returned. It was the first film in the franchise to be released in 3-D for its first run, though the first two films, which were originally released in 2-D, were re-released in 3-D in 2009 as a double feature.[133] Like its predecessors, Toy Story 3 received enormous critical acclaim, earning a 99% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes.[135] It also grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing animated film until the release of 2013's Frozen.[136][137] | In November 1996, the Disney on Ice: Toy Story ice show opened which featured the cast's voices as well as Randy Newman's music.[138] In April 2008, the Disney Wonder cruise ship launched Toy Story: The Musical shows on its cruises.[139] | Toy Story also led to a spin-off direct-to-video animated film, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, as well as the animated television series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.[140] The film and series followed Buzz Lightyear and his friends at Star Command as they uphold justice across the galaxy. Although the film was criticized for not using the same animation as in Toy Story and Toy Story 2, it sold three million VHS and DVDs in its first week of release.[141][142] The television series brought further commercial and critical acclaim, winning a Daytime Emmy in 2001 for Outstanding Sound Editing. The series ran for a total of 65 episodes. | Following the release of Toy Story 3, a series of Toy Story short films have been shown in theaters in front of other Disney features: Hawaiian Vacation (shown before Cars 2), centering on Barbie and Ken on vacation in Bonnie's room, Small Fry (shown before The Muppets), centering on Buzz being left in a fast-food restaurant, and Partysaurus Rex (shown before the 3D re-release of Finding Nemo), centering on Rex partying with Bonnie's bath toys. | In January 2013, a fan-made live-action version of the film was posted on YouTube that received more than 15 million views before being taken down by Disney for copyright of the audio.[143][144][145] In February 2016, the video returned to YouTube. | In October 2013, ABC aired Toy Story of Terror!, promoting it as Pixar's first television special.[146] In the special, Mr. Potato Head disappears and Woody, Buzz and Rex have to find him. | On December 2, 2014, ABC aired Toy Story That Time Forgot. In the story, Woody, Buzz, Rex and Trixie (one of the toy characters introduced in Toy Story 3) are trapped in room with a group of humanoid dinosaur warrior toys called Battlesaurs who do not know that they are toys and must escape.[147] | A third sequel, Toy Story 4, will be released on June 15, 2018.[13] It will be directed by John Lasseter, and will focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep.[148] | Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story and Disney's Activity Center: Toy Story were released for Windows and Mac.[149] Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story was the best selling software title of 1996, selling over 500,000 copies.[150] Two console video games were released for the film: the Toy Story video game, for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, and PC as well as Toy Story Racer, for the PlayStation (which contains elements from Toy Story 2).[151] Pixar created original animations for all of the games, including fully animated sequences for the PC titles. | Toy Story had a large promotion before its release, leading to numerous tie-ins with the film including images on food packaging.[75] A variety of merchandise was released during the film's theatrical run and its initial VHS release including toys, clothing, and shoes, among other things.[152] When an action figure for Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody was created it was initially ignored by retailers. However, after over 250,000 figures were sold for each character before the film's release, demand continued to expand, eventually reaching over 25 million units sold by 2007.[91] | Toy Story and its sequels have inspired multiple attractions at the theme parks of Walt Disney World and Disneyland: | Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin at the Magic Kingdom casts theme park guests as cadets in Buzz's Space Ranger Corps. Guests ride through various scenes featuring Emperor Zurg's henchmen, firing \"laser cannons\" at their Z symbols, scoring points for each hit.[153] | Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters at Disneyland, is similar to Space Ranger Spin, except that the laser cannons are hand-held rather than mounted to the ride vehicle.[154] | Buzz Lightyear's Astroblasters at Walt Disney World's DisneyQuest, despite the nearly identical name to the Disneyland attraction, is a bumper car style attraction in which guests compete against each other not only by ramming their ride vehicles into each other, but also by firing \"asteroids\" (playground balls) at each other.[155] | Toy Story Mania at both Walt Disney World's Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland's Disney California Adventure features a series of interactive carnival-type games hosted by the Toy Story characters. Guests ride in vehicles while wearing 3-D glasses, and using a pull-string cannon to launch virtual rings, darts, baseballs, etc. Disney announced an update to the attraction to add characters from Toy Story 3 several months before the film's release date.[156][157] | World of Color at Disney California Adventure is a large night time water and light show. Some of the scenes projected on the water screens feature animation from the Toy Story films.[158] | Toy Story Playland at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland, opening in August 2010 and 2011 respectively. The area is designed to create the illusion of \"shrinking the guest\" down to the size of a toy, and to play in Andy's backyard in several themed rides.[159] | Toy Story Character Greetings are located at almost all Disney Parks. Three of the main characters, Buzz Lightyear, Woody and Jessie are normally the characters you would meet. Sometimes you can even meet Bullseye, the Green Army Men and Mr. Potato Head. | Toy Story's cast of characters forms the basis for the naming of the releases of the Debian computer operating system, from buzz in 1996 to stretch, the version currently (in 2015) being prepared for release.[160] | In 2013 Pixar designed a \"Gromit Lightyear\" sculpture based on the Aardman Animations character Gromit for Gromit Unleashed which sold for £65,000.[161]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"John Lasseter","m_produced_by":"Ralph Guggenheim | Bonnie Arnold","m_screenplay_by":"Joss Whedon | Andrew Stanton | Joel Cohen | Alec Sokolow","m_story_by":"John Lasseter | Pete Docter | Andrew Stanton | Joe Ranft","m_starring":"Tom Hanks | Tim Allen | Laurie Metcalf | Annie Potts | Don Rickles | Wallace Shawn | John Ratzenberger | Jim Varney","m_music_by":"Randy Newman","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Robert Gordon | Lee Unkrich","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures Distribution","m_release_dates":"November 19, 1995 (1995-11-19) (El Capitan Theatre) | November 22, 1995 (1995-11-22) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"81 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$30 million[2]","m_box_office":"$362 million[3] | Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. Toy Story follows a group of anthropomorphic toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, and focuses on the relationship between Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (voiced by Tim Allen). The film was written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman. Its executive producers were Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. It was released in theatres November 22, 1995. | Pixar, which produced short animated films to promote their computers, was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature after the success of the short film, Tin Toy (1988), which is told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Pete Docter wrote early story treatments which were thrown out by Disney, who pushed for a more edgy film. After disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was re-written, better reflecting the tone and theme Pixar desired: that \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions.\"[4] The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under minor financial constraints.[5][6] | The top-grossing film on its opening weekend,[7] Toy Story went on to earn over $361 million worldwide.[3] Reviews were positive, praising both the animation's technical innovation and the screenplay's wit and sophistication,[8][9] and it is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the best animated films ever made.[10] The film received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", as well as winning a Special Achievement Academy Award.[11] It was inducted into the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2005, its first year of eligibility.[12] In addition to home media releases and theatrical re-releases, Toy Story-inspired material has run the gamut from toys, video games, theme park attractions, spin-offs, merchandise, and two sequels—Toy Story 2 (1999) and Toy Story 3 (2010)—both of which also garnered massive commercial success and critical acclaim, with a third sequel, Toy Story 4, slated for a 2018 release.[13] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"Isaacson, Walter (2011).
