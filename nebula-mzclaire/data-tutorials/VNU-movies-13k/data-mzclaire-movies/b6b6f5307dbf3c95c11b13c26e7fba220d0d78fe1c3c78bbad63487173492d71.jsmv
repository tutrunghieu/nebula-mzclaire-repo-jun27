{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"As a twelve year old living in Arizona, Mark Evans (Elijah Wood) recently experiences the death of his mother, Janice (Ashley Crow). He is then taken by his father, Jack (David Morse), to stay with his uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) in Maine during the winter break while he goes on a business trip to Tokyo, Japan. Mark is re-introduced to his extended family, including his cousins Connie (Quinn Culkin) and Henry (Macaulay Culkin). Mark and Henry get along at first and Henry seems to be nice and well-mannered. But Henry displays an abnormal fascination with death, as he discusses the death of Mark's mother and that of his younger brother Richard, making Mark uneasy. | Henry continues to display psychopathic behavior, which Mark is unable to tell Wallace and Susan about due to Henry's dark threats. One of Henry's violent actions include throwing a dummy off a bridge and onto the highway, causing a car pileup. Later, Henry plans to kill his sister. Terrified that something might happen to Connie, Mark spends the night in her room. The next morning, Mark awakens to find Henry has taken Connie ice skating. At the pond, Henry purposely throws his sister toward thin ice. The ice collapses and Connie nearly drowns before she is rescued and taken to the hospital. Susan becomes suspicious of Henry when he visits Connie's room, planning to smother her, but Susan, who has been sitting in the dark out of view, interrupts him. | Susan finds a rubber duck that Henry has hidden in his shed. It had once belonged to Richard and was with him in the bathtub the night he drowned, after which it went missing. When Susan confronts Henry, he coldly reminds her the toy had belonged to him before it had been Richard's. He asks for the duck back, but Susan refuses, and Henry tries to take it from her. After a violent tug-of-war, Henry takes the toy and escapes to the cemetery where he throws it down a well, indicating that Richard meant nothing to him. | As Susan and Mark grow closer, Henry insinuates he will kill Susan rather than let Mark continue to develop a relationship with her. When a fight breaks out between the two boys, Wallace locks Mark in the den. Henry asks a suspicious Susan to go for a walk with him, while Mark escapes the den and chases after them. Susan firmly asks if Henry killed his brother. Henry indirectly replies, \"What if I did?\" | Horrified by what her son has become, Susan tells Henry that he needs help, but Henry flees into the woods. Susan gives chase, and upon arriving at a cliff, Henry shoves her over the edge. As Susan dangles precariously, Henry picks up a large rock he intends to throw down at her, but Mark intervenes and tackles his cousin, and they fight while Susan climbs back up. In the ensuing brawl, the boys roll off the cliff but are caught by Susan. She arduously hangs onto both boys, each with one hand. Henry holds on with both hands, but Mark's one-handed grip begins to slip. With only enough strength to save one of them, Susan notes her son's icy-calm demeanor, confident that his mother will save him. However, Susan, now aware of her son's deeply evil nature, reluctantly releases him from her grasp and he falls to his death. Susan pulls Mark up from the ledge, and they look down upon Henry's body on the rocks below, before it is washed away into the sea. | When Mark returns to Arizona, he reflects upon Susan's choice to save him instead of Henry and wonders if she would make the same choice again, but knows it is something he will never ask her.","m_cast":"Elijah Wood as Mark Evans.
