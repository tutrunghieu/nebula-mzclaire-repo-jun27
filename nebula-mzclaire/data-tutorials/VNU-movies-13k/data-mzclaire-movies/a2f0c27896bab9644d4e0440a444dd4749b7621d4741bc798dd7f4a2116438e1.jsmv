As the story develops Bennett's younger brother Ryan is introduced and he is grieving the fact he did not say a final good bye to his brother. One sees the true relationships of the family as the story comes together, Grace waits at the bed of Jordan Walker, the man driving the truck which collided with Bennett's car in the crash. She is waiting for him to wake so she can ask him what occurring during her son's final 17 minutes. After a while, she finds out the truth, but is disappointed with what she hears. In the last moments, Bennett was not calling his mother's name, he was calling to Rose asking the other wounded passenger Walker to make sure that she was safe. | Allen hires a cleaner to clean the house, but when Grace finds out she is terribly angry, claiming their son has been washed away. Allen then appears to be having a heart attack, whilst Grace carries on shouting until she realises what is happening. At the hospital bed, shortly after Grace returns from finding out about Bennett's final minutes, Allen breaks down crying, saying that he had been holding in all his grief and upset, and that he could have done something to prevent the crash and his son's death. | Meanwhile, Rose has overheard Grace saying she should have died and not Bennett, and so she leaves and seeks the help of her own mother. She soon realises that all her mother is bothered about is trying to get money from the Brewer's, claiming it will help her. The Brewer's try to find Rose and they find her in labour and persuade her to go to the hospital and, while in the car on the way, she seeks to find out everything about Bennett she did not already know. | When the film draws to a close, one sees Rose and the baby, a girl called Ruby, Grace's favourite girl's name. The film ends with the moment Bennett spoke to Rose earlier on the day he died.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.[5] Another film starring Mulligan, the Oscar-nominated An Education, also screened at the festival.
