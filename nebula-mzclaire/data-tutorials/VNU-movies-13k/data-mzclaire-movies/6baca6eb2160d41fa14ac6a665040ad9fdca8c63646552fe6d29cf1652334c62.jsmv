{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the framing story, a man (Peter Falk) reads a book, The Princess Bride, to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). Scenes of the reading occasionally interrupt the main story; for example, when the boy tells his grandfather to skip the parts with kissing in it. | Buttercup (Robin Wright) has grown up on a farm in the Renaissance Era, in the (fictional) country of Florin. She mercilessly orders around the farmhand, Westley (Cary Elwes), but he only replies \"As you wish\" to her every whim. Buttercup eventually comes to understand that this is his expression of love, which she then comes to return. Westley leaves to seek his fortune so that they might marry, but Buttercup learns that Westley's ship was attacked by the legendary Dread Pirate Roberts, who is infamous for leaving no one alive. Accordingly, Westley is presumed dead. | Five years later, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the Crown Prince of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by a trio of bandits; a Sicilian boss named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), a giant named Fezzik (André the Giant), and a Spanish master swordsman named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who is seeking revenge against his father's murderer, whom he knows to have six fingers on his right hand. These three are in Humperdinck's employ and have been ordered to kill Buttercup once in Guilder, Florin's enemy, as a pretext to start a war. The four are soon followed by a man dressed in black, and Vizzini orders Inigo and Fezzik to kill him. The man in black bests Inigo in swordplay, knocking him out with the butt of his sword, then chokes Fezzik unconscious in melee combat, and finally tricks Vizzini into drinking lethal poison during a battle of wits, and thereby frees Buttercup. | Buttercup, believing the man in black to be the Dread Pirate Roberts, tries to escape and pushes him down a steep hill, but when he shouts \"As you wish\" as he falls, she realizes he is her beloved Westley and throws herself down the hill after him. As Westley escorts her back to Florin across a hazardous bog called Fire Swamp, he explains that though he was captured, the previous Roberts, intrigued by Westley's pleas for mercy and his stories about Buttercup, befriended Westley and trained him in fighting and swordsmanship, and after secretly revealing that he was not the original Roberts (he inherited the title), he eventually retired and bequeathed the title to Westley. Humperdinck, Count Rugen (Christopher Guest) and their men eventually capture Westley and Buttercup and take them back to Florin; Humperdinck later tells Buttercup he has let Westley return to his ship, but in reality Rugen and the Albino (Mel Smith) are torturing Westley in a secret laboratory called the Pit of Despair, using a torture machine to drain the life from him. When Buttercup tells Humperdinck that he is a coward and that she still loves Westley, Humperdinck locks her in a suite, rushes to the Pit and, ignoring Rugen's warning, engages the machine at its highest setting, sending a screaming Westley to his death. | Fezzik, having reunited with a drunk Inigo in a nearby village, has learned that Rugen is the six-fingered man Inigo seeks, but, with the castle secured for Humperdinck's wedding, believes they need the man in black's (Westley's) help to invade. Fezzik sobers up Inigo, they stumble upon the Albino, and Fezzik inadvertently kills him when trying to receive information on Westley and Rugen. Westley's dying screams lead them to the Pit, and they recover his body, bringing it to Miracle Max (Billy Crystal), a bitter and destitute apothecary whose confidence had been shattered due to his banishment from the castle by Humperdinck. Max notes that Westley is \"only mostly dead\", but sustained by true love, and provides a potion (in the form of a chocolate-covered pill) that brings him back to life. Outside the castle gate, Inigo and Fezzik give Westley the pill; he quickly begins to recover, and comes up a plan to make their way through the castle guards and into the castle itself, | Hearing the commotion outside, Humperdinck panics and orders the priest to declare him and Buttercup married. Having scared the soldiers off, Inigo, Fezzik and Westley make their way into the castle corridors and are intercepted by Rugen and his men; Inigo quickly dispatches the men and introduces himself to Rugen: | \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" | Rugen beats a cowardly retreat with Inigo in pursuit; leaving Westley in the hallway, Fezzik runs to help Inigo, who ultimately confronts Rugen in the armory. Rugen injures Inigo multiple times, but strengthened by his determination to exact revenge, Inigo overpowers and kills Rugen. Meanwhile, Westley somehow finds his way into the honeymoon suite and stops Buttercup just as she is about to kill herself; Westley points out to her that because she did not say \"I do\", the ceremony was not properly completed; therefore, the marriage is not valid. When Humperdinck arrives ready to kill him once and for all, Westley bluffs being at full health and forces Humperdinck to stand down and turn over Buttercup; she ties him to a chair and they all leave him alone with his cowardice. | As Buttercup, Westley, Inigo and Fezzik prepare to leave (on four white horses Fezzik found), Inigo wonders about what he will do with his life now that he has fulfilled his vow; Westley suggests he take up piracy saying \"You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.\" | In the framing story, the grandson allows the grandfather to read on about Westley and Buttercup sharing a passionate kiss. As the grandfather finishes the story and prepares to leave, the boy asks him to read the story again the next day.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's consensus states: \"A delightfully postmodern fairy tale, The Princess Bride is a deft, intelligent mix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel-in-distress story and makes it fresh.\"[14] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 77 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"[15] | Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating on their television program.[16] Ebert also wrote a very favorable print review in his column for the Chicago Sun-Times.[17] Richard Corliss of Time said the film was fun for the whole family,[18] and later, Time listed the film as one of the \"Best of '87\".[19] Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the cast and the sweetness of the movie.[20] | The Princess Bride was not a major box-office success, but it became a cult classic after its release to the home video market. The film is widely regarded as eminently quotable.[21][22] | In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted The Princess Bride the 38th greatest comedy film of all time. In 2006, William Goldman's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 84th best screenplay of all time; it earned the same ranking in the Guild's 2013 update.[23] The film was selected number 88 on The American Film Institute's (AFI) \"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Passions\" listing the 100 greatest film love stories of all time.

In 1973, 20th Century Fox paid Goldman $500,000 for the film rights and to do a screenplay.[2] Richard Lester was signed to direct and the movie was almost made, but then the head of production at Fox was fired and the project was put on hiatus. Goldman subsequently bought back the film rights to the novel with his own money.[3] The movie almost got financed several times over the next decade—at one stage in the early 1980s Christopher Reeve was interested in playing Westley[4]—before Rob Reiner managed to secure funding from Norman Lear.[5] | The film was shot in various locations in Great Britain and Ireland: | Carl Wark, Sheffield, England | Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, England | Cave Dale, Castleton, Derbyshire, England | Bradley Rocks and Robin Hood's Stride, Birchover, Derbyshire, England | Cliffs of Moher, County Clare, Ireland (for the Cliffs of Insanity) | Haddon Hall, Bakewell, Derbyshire, England | Penshurst Place, Kent, England [6] | Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin learned to fence (both left- and right-handed) for the film (reportedly spending all their free time during the production practicing with fencing instructors Bob Anderson and Peter Diamond, and with each other). They actually performed all of the fencing in the sword fight scene, although stunt doubles were used for the two somersaults.[7] | Popular professional wrestler André the Giant had undergone major back surgery prior to filming and, despite his great size and strength, could not support the weight of Cary Elwes during their fight scene or Robin Wright for a scene at the end of the film. For the wrestling scene, when Elwes was pretending to hang on André's back, he was actually walking on a series of ramps below the camera during close-ups. For the wide shots, a stunt double took the place of André.[8] When he was apparently carrying Wright, she was actually suspended by cables.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Princess Bride  by William Goldman","m_directed_by":"Rob Reiner","m_produced_by":"Andrew Scheinman | Rob Reiner","m_screenplay_by":"William Goldman","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Peter Falk","m_music_by":"Mark Knopfler","m_cinematography":"Adrian Biddle","m_edited_by":"Robert Leighton","m_production_company":"Act III Communications","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox (North America) | Vestron Pictures (International)","m_release_dates":"September 25, 1987 (1987-09-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"98 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$16 million","m_box_office":"$30.9 million | The Princess Bride is a 1987 American romantic fantasy adventure comedy film directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner, and starring Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, and Christopher Guest.
