He meets and marries singer Willia Stutsman, a.k.a. \"Bobbie Meredith\" (Bel Geddes), and the two form their own Dixieland band called \"The Five Pennies\" (a play on Nichols' name, since a nickel equals five pennies). As their popularity peaks, their young daughter Dorothy (Susan Gordon) contracts polio and the family leaves the music business, moving to Los Angeles. When Dorothy becomes a teen (Tuesday Weld) she learns of her father's music career and persuades him go on a comeback tour. The tour borders on failure until several notable musicians from Nichols' past appear to save the day.","m_cast":"Danny Kaye as Red Nichols | Barbara Bel Geddes as Willa Stutsman | Louis Armstrong as Himself | Harry Guardino as Tony Valani | Bob Crosby as Will Paradise | Bobby Troup as Artie Schutt | Susan Gordon as Dorothy Nichols - Ages 6 to 8 | Tuesday Weld as Dorothy Nichols - Age 13 | Ray Anthony as Jimmy Dorsey | Shelly Manne as Dave Tough | Ray Daley as Glenn Miller | Valerie Allen as Tommye Eden | Bob Hope as Himself (cameo)","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Melville Shavelson","m_produced_by":"Jack Rose","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Danny Kaye Barbara Bel Geddes Louis Armstrong Harry Guardino Bob Crosby Bobby Troup","m_music_by":"Thorton W.
