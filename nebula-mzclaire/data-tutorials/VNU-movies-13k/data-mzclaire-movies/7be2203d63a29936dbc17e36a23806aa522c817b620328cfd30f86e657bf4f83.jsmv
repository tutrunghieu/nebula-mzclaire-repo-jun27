{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"College student Nick O'Bannon attends a race at the McKinley Speedway with his girlfriend Lori Milligan and their friends; Hunt Wynorski and Janet Cunningham when he suddenly has a premonition of a terrible accident that sends debris into the stadium, killing several people and causing the stadium to collapse. In his panic, Nick inadvertently starts an argument with Carter Daniels, who demands his wife stay as he chases them out of the stadium. Mechanic Andy Kewzer and his girlfriend Nadia Monroy along with mother Samantha Lane also exit the stadium followed by security guard George Lanter. When the accident occurs, George prevents Carter from going in after his wife and a scuffle ensues. As she is yelling at the group, Nadia is suddenly decapitated by a tire flying out of the stadium. | Several days after the disaster, a drunken Carter tries to set a cross ablaze on George's front lawn blaming him for preventing him from saving his wife, but a chain of events causes his tow truck to start driving on its own and as Carter tries to regain control, he is grabbed by the towing chain and is blown up by his truck catching fire with the very gas he was using. The following day, Samantha is finishing up at a beauty parlor when a rock propelled by a lawn mower suddenly impales her eye and kills her. After reading about the events in the paper, Nick becomes convinced that death is coming after them for evading their fates at the stadium. Hunt and Janet are dubious, but they manage to convince George about what is happening. The group arrives to warn Andy, but he is killed when a tank, propelled by a chain reaction from a faulty wench launches him through a chain link fence. After receiving a premonition involving water, Nick tries to warn Hunt, who has gone for one last conquest at the pool, while George and Lori try to find Janet, who becomes immobilized in a malfunctioning car wash. Hunt drops his lucky coin in the water after an accidental placement of a toy turned the pool's drain on. As he dives into the pool, he is pulled down to the drain where the pressure mounts, and his insides are eventually ripped into the draining system before Nick can rescue him. George and Lori rescue Janet from the car wash at the last second. Afterwards, George admits to having tried to commit suicide due to his family being killed in a car accident the year before that he believes was his fault, but every suicide attempt has failed. Lori believes saving Janet must have saved the rest of them from death's plan and the group celebrates instead. | Nick then remembers a cowboy; Jonathan Groves, they had jeered at during the race, who had changed seats prior to the premonition coming true and he and George track him down at a hospital, where he remained in traction following being recovered from the stadium's debris. After a bathtub left on in the floor above causes his electric equipment to start sparking, falling from his bed and trying to cross the room, Nick and George witness him being crushed as the tub crashes through the weakened floor. Afterward, George is suddenly obliterated by a speeding ambulance and Nick realizes that Janet and Lori are still in danger. Tracking them down to a movie at the mall, Nick successfully saves Lori, but insistent that her life is no longer in danger, Janet remains as a chain reaction behind the theater causes an explosion and kills her. A multitude of explosions race Nick and Lori through the mall until they are trapped on a malfunctioning escalator and Lori is slowly dragged into the gears and killed. This is revealed to be a premonition, but Nick again fails to save George. | At the mall, Lori begins seeing omens of death around her, but Janet convinces her to shrug it off. Having failed in his premonition, Nick runs back stage to stop the explosion. He is pinned down by a nail gun that activates itself as he tries to stop the fire from spreading to explosive materials. Nick activates the fire suppression system, successfully stopping the explosion and saving everyone. Months later, Nick notices a loose pylon while heading to their favorite hangout \"Death by Coffee\" and warns the construction worker about it, who fails to hear him. While talking with Lori and Janet, he comes up with the theory that his omens were red herrings meant to get them in the right place at the right time for death to kill them. Just as he realizes this, and sees another omen, the pylon outside collapses, causing a truck to swerve and crash into the coffee shop. As the scene switches to x-ray Janet is crushed under the truck's tires, Lori is internally decapitated by the impact, and Nick is propelled into a wall and killed.","m_cast":"Bobby Campo as Nick O'Bannon | Shantel VanSanten as Lori Milligan | Nick Zano as Hunt Wynorski | Haley Webb as Janet Cunningham | Mykelti Williamson as George Lanter | Krista Allen as Samantha Lane | Andrew Fiscella as Andy Kewzer | Justin Welborn as Carter Daniels | Stephanie Honoré as Nadia Monroy | Lara Grice as Cynthia Daniels | Jackson Walker as Jonathan Groves","m_reception":"The film received generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 29% of 95 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 4.2 out of 10.[21] The site's consensus is: \"With little of the ingenuity of previous installments, The Final Destination is predictable, disposable horror fare.\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 30 based on 14 reviews.[22]","m_production":"After the success of Final Destination 3, which was initially planned to be in 3D,[5] Eric Bress wrote a script, which impressed producer Craig Perry and Warner Bros. enough to green-light a fourth installment. James Wong was on board to direct, but because of scheduling conflicts with Dragonball Evolution, he decided to drop out. Consequently, the studio executives opted for David R. Ellis to return because of his work on Final Destination 2. He accepted because of the 3D.[6] For the 3D, Perry said that he wanted it to add depth to the film instead of just \"something pop[ping] out at the audience every four minutes.\"[7] | Although shooting was to be done in Vancouver, which was where the previous three films were shot, David R. Ellis convinced the producers to shoot in New Orleans instead to bring business to the city, and because the budget was already large.[8] The opening crash sequence at \"McKinley Speedway\" was filmed at Mobile International Speedway in Irvington, Alabama. Filming began in March 2008 and ended in late May in the same year.[7] Reshoots were done in April 2009 at Universal Studios Florida.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"characters created  by Jeffrey Reddick","m_directed_by":"David R.
