{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Julian (John Paul Tremblay) plans to steal money from an automated teller machine (ATM). He gets his two best friends, Ricky (Robb Wells) and Bubbles (Mike Smith), to help him succeed in the operation and get rich. But the plan goes awry and the police chase them. Bubbles runs off and the cops spare him, but Ricky and Julian are arrested. | Ricky and Julian are sentenced to 18 months, but jail instructor Donny (Gerry Dee) ejects them 26 days early to prevent Ricky from playing goalie for a rival team, so Donny and his team have a chance to win an upcoming jail street-hockey tournament. Ricky and Julian are picked up by Bubbles and Ricky's father Ray (Barrie Dunn) and brought back to Sunnyvale Trailer Park, and greeted by the trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey (John Dunsworth) and his shirtless, cheeseburger-loving assistant, Randy (Patrick Roach). | Ricky decides to get back with his girlfriend Lucy (Lucy DeCoutere) and become a better father to their daughter Trinity. But Lucy's friend Sarah (Sarah Dunsworth) tells him that Lucy got new breast implants and has a new job at a strip club, and that her boss Sonny (Hugh Dillon)(who owns the club) is a dangerous man. After leaving the strip club, the boys decide to do \"The Big Dirty\", a crime that will allow them to retire from their criminal lives. | Julian and his new girlfriend Wanda (Nichole Hiltz) go to the movies on their first date. Waiting in the snack line, Julian sees a money machine filled with change and believes he has found the \"Big Dirty\" and informs Ricky and Bubbles of the plan. | Ricky returns to the strip club and discovers that Lucy and Sonny have had sex 28 times; enraged, he leaves. As a party at J-Roc (Jonathan Torrens)'s trailer starts back at the park, Ricky listens to April Wine as Lucy arrives and says that it was a lie and she only had sex with Sonny five or six times. Ricky proposes to Lucy at J-Roc's party and she says yes, she then proceeds to get drunk and flash the entire party crowd. | In the area to post a condemned notice, Lahey destroys Bubbles' shed and lies to trailer-park owner Barb Lahey (Shelley Thompson) that Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles' lot fees are three months unpaid and after police intervene in a scuffle they accept they must vacate in 30 days. To keep themselves in Sunnyvale, the boys decide to do the Big Dirty at the movie theatre, but things go wrong when Julian's cohorts Cory (Cory Bowles) and Trevor (Michael Jackson) pull the fire alarm. Ricky and Julian escape with the money from the machines, accomplishing their mission. | At Ricky and Lucy's wedding, Sonny confronts them both with a handgun and shoots at Ricky's car causing the money to fall out through the bullet-holes in the trunk. Officers George Green and Ted Johnston arrest Sonny and Wanda and leave, but Lahey sees the money falling out of the car and tries to chase the boys to capture them. Lahey and Randy flip their car and the cops crash into Ricky's car, causing the money to fly out. | In court Ricky demands that Lahey use a breathalyzer to determine if he's drunk, which would prove his testimony worthless. Lahey is exposed as drunk, and the judge proclaims the boys innocent. The prosecutor also remarks that since there is no evidence that the money was taken illegally, it will be returned to the boys. A victorious Ricky tells off Lahey but this causes the prosecutor to threaten to jail Ricky for a week. Ricky asks Lucy and Trinity if they mind that he returns to jail for a short time, which they approve; he tells off the entire court and is sentenced to one week in jail, which would allow him to play in the hockey tournament with Cory and Trevor. The team beats Donny's team, and Cory and Trevor become prison heroes after \"pantsing\" Donny in front of everyone.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Trailer Park Boys: The Movie has received mixed to positive reviews.
