{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"German U-boat U-571 is immobilized by a British destroyer. The US Navy submarine S-33 has been modified to resemble a German U-boat to steal the Enigma coding device and sink the U-571. | During a storm, S-33 comes across U-571 and sends a boarding party over. After securing the ship and transporting the captured crew back to the American S-33 sub, S-33 gets sunk by the arrival of a German resupply sub. The captain of S-33, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren, dying in the water, orders his men on the captured U-boat to submerge. Lieutenant Tyler takes command of the enemy U-boat and dives to engage the resupply sub in an underwater battle before destroying it. | After making repairs and restoring power Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine to Land's End in Cornwall, England. They are spotted by a German plane which is unaware that U-571 has been commandeered by Americans; a nearby German destroyer sends over a small contingent but right before boarders arrive, Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun, destroying the German ship's radio room, and preventing it from reporting the capture of a German sub and its Enigma machine and code books. The sub dives underneath the German ship, which then begins to drop depth charges to sink U-571. | Tyler attempts to trick the destroyer into stopping its attack by ejecting debris and a corpse out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction. The German destroyer continues dropping depth charges. U-571, hiding at below 600 feet (180 m), is damaged by the high water pressure. Control of the main ballast tanks is lost and the ship ascends uncontrollably. Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerse himself in the bilge underwater to repressurize the torpedo tubes. | Trigger uses an air hose to enter the flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the torpedo tubes, but a second leak and broken valve are found, which Trigger can't reach. U-571 surfaces, unable to fire its last torpedo. The destroyer fires on the ship, which is heavily damaged and begins to flood. The first hit causes pipes to collapse, pinning Trigger's leg, after he has left the air hose behind. Unable to turn back, he reaches for the valve and closes it before he dies. The second the pressure is available, Tyler orders Tank to fire the final torpedo. The German destroyer is destroyed. As the crew sigh in relief, Tank reports Trigger's death. U-571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long. The crew abandons ship with the Enigma in their possession. The crew watch U-571 as she slips beneath the waves. Floating aboard an inflatable lifeboat, they are eventually rescued by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat.","m_cast":"Matthew McConaughey as Lieutenant Andrew Tyler | Bill Paxton as Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren | Harvey Keitel as Chief Gunner's Mate Henry Klough | Jon Bon Jovi as Lieutenant Pete Emmett | David Keith as Major Matthew Coonan | Jake Weber as Lieutenant Michael Hirsch | Jack Noseworthy as Seaman Bill Wentz | Tom Guiry as Seaman Ted \"Trigger\" Fitzgerald | Will Estes as Torpedoman Ronald \"Rabbit\" Parker | T.

In the film, a World War II German submarine is boarded in 1942 by disguised United States Navy submariners seeking to capture her Enigma cipher machine. | The film was financially successful and generally well-received by critics in the USA[1] and won an Academy Award for sound editing.[2] The fictitious plot attracted substantial criticism since, in reality, it was British personnel from HMS Bulldog who first captured a naval Enigma machine (from U-110 in the North Atlantic in May 1941), months before the United States had even entered the war. The anger over the inaccuracies even reached the British Parliament, where Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the film was an \"affront\" to British sailors.[3] | The real U-571 was never involved in any such events, was not captured, and was in fact sunk in January 1944, off Ireland, by a Short Sunderland flying boat from No. 461 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force. | U-571 was filmed in the Mediterranean, near Rome and Malta.[4] Footage, sets and models from the movie have been reused for other productions, including 'Submerged,' depicting the loss of the USS Sailfish (SS-192), and the fictional Ghostboat. A non-diving replica of the S-33 is located in Grand Harbour, Valleta.[citation needed] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"U-571 at the Internet Movie Database | U-571 at AllMovie | U-571 at the TCM Movie Database | U-571 at Rotten Tomatoes | U-571 at Metacritic | U-571 at Box Office Mojo | Imperial War Museum Enigma pages: Captured!
