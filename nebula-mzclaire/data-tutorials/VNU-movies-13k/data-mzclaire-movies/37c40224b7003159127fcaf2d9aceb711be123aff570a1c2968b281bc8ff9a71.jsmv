{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Max (Cayden Boyd) is a lonely child in the suburbs of Austin who creates an imaginary world named Planet Drool, where all of his imagination and dreams come to life. He creates two characters; Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner), a young boy who was raised by sharks after losing his father at sea, and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them alight. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In real life, Max's parents (Richard Jenkins and Kate Beckinsale) have little time for him, and their marriage seems to be on the rocks, and he is bullied by fellow schoolmate Linus (Shane Graham). However, he does receive friendship from Marissa (Sasha Pieterse), the daughter of his teacher Ms. Electricidad (Diane Keaton, whose name is English for \"electricity\"). Linus steals Max's Dream Journal (where all of his ideas are kept), and vandalizes it. The next day, a tornado rages outside the school, and moments later, Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear, and ask Max to come with them to Planet Drool. They reach Planet Drool via a shark-like spacecraft, where Max learns that the dreamworld is turning bad, courtesy of Ms. Super Gay (also portrayed by Diane Keaton), originally the dreamworld's electrician, but now corrupted. | Sharkboy and Lavagirl save some children from an out-of-control roller coaster called \"Mount Neverrest\". Then with Max, they confront Ms. Super Gay, who quickly drops them in a part of Planet Drool called the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Bablo (voiced by Diane Keaton), a Female moose that was never finished being built by Max, but offers them a lift to other parts of the planet (in which they ride on his eyes and mouth since he can't move the rest of his body parts). Whilst on the journey, the three form a friendship, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Ms. Super Gay and his \"dogs\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess, and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool, and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to Linus's Planet Drool incarnation Minus, who has altered the dreamworld with Max's own Dream Journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by Lalas and has a shark frenzy, destroying the cage. Max retrieves the Dream Journal from Minus while he is sleeping, after the three escape. Max informs Sharkboy that his father is alive in his book, but when Lavagirl wishes to find out what it says about her true identity, she burns the book to ash. In rage, Lavagirl asks him why she was made out of lava, but Sharkboy tells Max to let her cool down. | With little time left, Max, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl reach the Ice Princess, the Planet Drool incarnation of Marissa Electricidad (Sasha Pieterse), after an encounter with the Ursula (voiced by Diane Keaton). She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they find they are too late to stop the corruption since the ice princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power, and she cannot leave her home. Mr. Electric fools Sharkboy into jumping into water filled with electric eels, seemingly killing him. Lavagirl jumps into the water to retrieve Sharkboy, but dies moments later. Tobor's face appears, and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream, which in turn revives Sharkboy, who then races Lavagirl to a volcano, where she too is revived. Max witnesses her revival, and concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have slowly engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer, and battles Linus/Minus, defeating him, and offering to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, which Minus agrees to. | Mr. Electric refuses to accept the new dreamworld, and flies off to Earth to kill Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom in the middle of the storm. Mr. Electric materializes before Max and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents get sucked into the storm, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa, allowing her to gain the Ice Princess's powers, which she uses to freeze, and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad (causing it to snow in Austin, Texas during August), Linus and Max all make peace with one another, and Max is reunited with his parents. | In the post-credit scene, Max informs his class that Planet Drool became a proper dreamworld again, Sharkboy became the King of the Ocean, and Lavagirl became Queen of the Volcanoes, including aquatic ones, and as the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class to \"dream a better dream, and work to make it real.\"","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl received a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the consensus: \"The decision to turn this kiddie fantasy into a 3-D film was a miscalculation.\"[7] Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and agreed with the other criticisms in which the 3-D process used was distracting and muted the colors, thus, he believes, \"spoiling\" much of the film and that the film would look more visually appealing when released in the home media market.[8] | For its opening weekend, the film earned $12.6 million in 2,655 theaters. It also was placed #5 at the box office, being overshadowed by Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Madagascar, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, and The Longest Yard.[9] The film was not very successful in the US, taking in $39,177,541 and was a box office bomb. However, it did manage to gross $30,248,282 overseas, for a total of $69,425,966 worldwide.[3] | The Total Nonstop Action professional wrestler Dean Roll, who trademarked the name \"Shark Boy\" in 1999, sued Miramax on June 8, 2005, claiming that his trademark had been infringed and demanding \"[any] money, profits and advantages wrongfully gained\". In April 2007, the suit was settled for a disclosed amount of $200,000.[10]","m_production":"Parts of the film were shot on location in Texas, where Max resides and goes to school in the film. Much of the film was shot in a studio against green screen. Most of the ships, landscapes and other effects including some creatures and characters, were accomplished digitally. According to Lautner and Dooley, when filming the scene with the dream train, the front part of the train was an actual physical set piece. \"The whole inside was there and when they have all the gadgets you can pull on, that was all there but everything else was a green screen,\" said Dooley.[4] Eleven visual effects companies (Hybride Technologies, CafeFX, The Orphanage, Post Logic, Hydraulx, Industrial Light & Magic, R!ot Pictures, Tippett Studio, Amalgamated Pixels and Intelligent Creatures and Rodriguez's Texas-based Troublemaker Digital) worked on the film in order to accomplish over 1,000 visual effect shots.[5] | Robert Rodriguez appears in the credits fourteen times, most notably as director, a producer, a screenwriter (along with Marcel Rodriguez), visual effects supervisor, director of photography, editor, a camera operator, and a composer and performer. The story is credited to Racer Max Rodriguez, with additional story elements by Rebecca Rodriguez, who also wrote the lyrics for the main song, \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\". Other members of the Rodriguez family can be seen in the film or were involved in the production. | Miley Cyrus had auditioned for the film with Lautner, and said it came down to her and another girl who was also auditioning; however, Cyrus began production on Hannah Montana.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Rodriguez","m_produced_by":"Elizabeth Avellan","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":"Racer Rodriguez","m_starring":"Taylor Lautner | Taylor Dooley | Cayden Boyd | Richard Jenkins | Kate Beckinsale | Diane Keaton","m_music_by":"John Debney | Graeme Revell | Robert Rodriguez[1]","m_cinematography":"Robert Rodriguez","m_edited_by":"Robert Rodriguez","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Miramax (United States) | Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (International) [1]","m_release_dates":"March 10, 2006 (2006-03-10) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$50 million","m_box_office":"$69.4 million[3] | The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D (also known simply as Sharkboy and Lavagirl) is a 2005 American science fantasy comedy adventure film[1] written and directed by Robert Rodriguez and released in the United States March 10, 2006 by Miramax, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Dimension Films.[2] The film uses the same anaglyph 3-D technology same time in All The Time In the World. The film stars Taylor Lautner, Taylor Dooley, Cayden Boyd, Richard Jenkins, Kate Beckinsale and Diane Keaton. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The special effects were done by Hybride Technologies, CafeFX, The Orphanage, Post Logic, Hydraulx, Industrial Light & Magic, R!ot Pictures, Tippett Studio, Amalgamated Pixels, Intelligent Creatures and Troublemaker Digital. The film received negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism directed at the decision to post-convert the film into 3-D which damaged the film's visual look, and earned $69.4 million on a $50 million budget. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=63298 | ^ a b Rotten Tomatoes - The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl | ^ a b \"The Adventure of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D (2005)\".
