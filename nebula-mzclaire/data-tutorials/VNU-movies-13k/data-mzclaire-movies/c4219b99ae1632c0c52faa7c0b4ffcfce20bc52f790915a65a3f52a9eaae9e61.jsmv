He uses the physical manifestation of the prehistoric creature to commit murders.

Exhibitor Jerry Zigmond suggested this subject might make a good film, and AIP commissioned Lou Rusoff to write a script.[1] | AIP did not have enough money to entirely finance the film, so the company asked Alex Gordon if he could contribute the remainder. Israel Berman, a colleague of Gordon's brother Richard, knew a financier called Jack Doppelt, who agreed to provide $40,000 of the film's $104,000 budget.[1] | Edward Cahn persuaded his old friend Edward Arnold to play the hypnotist[2] for $3,000 for one week's work, and also cast Peter Lorre. Arnold died two days before production, prompting Lorre to read the script, after which he pulled out of the film. The producer had to find a substitute cast quickly.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"an original idea by Jerry Zigmond","m_directed_by":"Edward L.
