{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Phoebe Ann Naylor (Rosemary Forsyth) is about to be wed to Don Andrea Baldazar, El Duce de la Casala (Alain Delon) in 1845 Louisiana. The festivities are broken up with the arrival of Yancey Cottle (Stuart Anderson) and his relatives, who form a U.S. Dragoons troop under the command of Cottle's cousin, Captain Rodney Stimpson (Peter Graves). | When Cottle, who wished to wed Phoebe Ann himself is accidentally killed, Don Andrea is charged with murder. He flees, promising to meet up with Phoebe Ann across the river in Texas, not yet a U.S. state. | In the wake of the failed wedding, Phoebe Ann is sent to Texas to lie low until the scandal blows over. Her wagon train is helped by Sam Hollis (Dean Martin) and his Indian sidekick, Kronk (Joey Bishop). | Along the way, Hollis gets separated from the wagon train and meets up with Don Andrea, whom he calls Baldy. The two form an antagonistic relationship, as well as a love-triangle with Phoebe Ann, made more complex by the Indian maiden Loneta (Tina Aumont), and the men's attempts to keep a Comanche raiding party at bay.","m_cast":"Dean Martin as Sam Hollis | Alain Delon as Don Andrea Baldazar, El Duce de la Casala (a.k.a.
