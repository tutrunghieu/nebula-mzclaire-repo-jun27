Directed by first time writer/director Pete Jones, Stolen Summer is the first film produced for Project Greenlight, an independent film competition created by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and sponsored by HBO.[1] Project Greenlight aired on HBO as a documentary series chronicling the selection of Jones's script from approximately seven thousand entries, and the production of the film in Chicago in 2001. | The film's casting department considered the casting of the Jewish Adi Stein as the Catholic Pete O'Malley an ironic joke, due to the character's attempting to convert a Jewish boy to Catholicism.[2][3] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Stolen Summer New York Times. | ^ Rohan, Virginia (March 20, 2002). \"Faithful Portrayal; Jewish Boy Plays A Catholic Who Tries To Convert A Jew\".
