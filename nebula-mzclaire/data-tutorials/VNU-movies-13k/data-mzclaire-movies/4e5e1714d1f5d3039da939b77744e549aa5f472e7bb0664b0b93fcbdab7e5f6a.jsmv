{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the tollbooth of a multistory carpark, Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is watching The Human Centipede (First Sequence) on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with. Overweight, asthmatic, and mentally challenged, Martin lives with his overbearing mother (Vivien Bridson), who blames him for having his father put in prison for physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes him heavy medication. Martin keeps a pet centipede, which he gleefully feeds insects to. | Martin acquires a dingy warehouse after killing the lessor and begins abducting people to use for his own human centipede. His victims include: an aggressive young man (Lucas Hansen) and his girlfriend (Emma Lock), two drunk girls (Kandice Caine and Georgia Goodrick) who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper, a man (Daniel Jude Gennis) and his pregnant wife (this couple has a toddler, whom Martin leaves in the back seat of their car uninjured), and another man. Martin also catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie (Gabe Kerr) having sex with a prostitute (Maddi Black), and proceeds to kill Sebring before abducting the cabbie and prostitute. When Martin's mother finds and destroys his scrapbook, Martin kills her by bludgeoning her head repeatedly with his crowbar until her skull caves in. He then lures his detested neighbour (Lee Nicholas Harris) to the scene, shoots, and kidnaps him. Martin's final victim is Ashlynn Yennie, the actress who played \"Jenny\" in the first film (now playing herself, having been lured by Martin under the pretense of a film audition with Quentin Tarantino). | With twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his \"centipede\". He severs the tendons in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, instead of actual surgeon tools, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; a grieving Martin places her in the corner. His \"human centipede\" is ultimately ten people long with Ashlynn in front. | After performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of laxative, forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his \"centipede\". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim's car and births her child. She then gets onto the road, but as she starts the engine, she stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. She still manages to escape. | The neighbour rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the \"centipede\" into two halves. Furious that his centipede is ruined, Martin shoots all the victims, and when he runs out of ammunition, uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As he advances on Ashlynn, he appears to give pause, and kneels in front of her. She punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into his rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs her in the neck and staggers out. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards. | The scene cuts back to the tollbooth, with Martin watching the credits of First Sequence on his laptop, with exactly the same reaction as the initial scene. However, the toddler left in the car from the previous kidnappings can be heard crying in the background.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) opened at 45th place with $49,456 (an average of $2,748 for the 18 theaters it premiered at). With four theaters added the next weekend, the film dropped a modest 29.9% with $34,679. Its third weekend saw a 56.2% drop despite having two more theaters added. However, in its fourth weekend, the film was pulled out of 12 theaters, causing a 61.9% drop ($5,792). In its final weekend, $2,267 was grossed, putting the movie's resting spot at #95.[38] | The film grossed $5,824 in Iceland and $1,511 in the United Kingdom. Released in April 2012, the horror picture grossed $21,111 in Peru. At the end of its run, the film made $141,877, about half of what the previous installment grossed. | The film has a rating of 30% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 77 reviews, with a consensus that reads \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) attempts to weave in social commentary but as the movie wears on, it loses its ability to repulse and shock and ends up obnoxious and annoying.\"[39] At Metacritic it rates 17 out of 100, or \"Overwhelming dislike\", from 22 reviews.[40] | Giving the film a score of 7 out of 10, Bloody Disgusting writer Brad Miska said the film was a \"brilliant response to critics of his first film. It makes a strong statement that it's just a movie and that people take his work way too seriously, while also implementing a unique concept\". Miska added that he \"found it an intensely engaging and absolutely hilarious meta experience that gets its point across with flying colors\", but was critical of the script's lack of depth.[41] Entertainment Weekly writer Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B+ rating, stating that viewers \"may feel gripped by the horror of what you're seeing and the terror of what's coming\". Gleiberman noted how \"The scatological climax would have the Marquis de Sade gagging into his popcorn.\"[42] Writing in the New York Post, V. A. Musetto gave the film 3 out of 4 and said Full Sequence \"is sick, disgusting and vile. (but) It's also demonically funny, stylish and ingenious.\"[43] | Jen Yamato, writing for Movieline, criticized the film's excessive gore and the way director Tom Six seemed to dislike his own audience. \"It's not really a film one can or should 'enjoy', which is what Six seems to be telling his own audience, the fans who giggled through The Human Centipede and demanded more! Gorier! More extreme! Well, those people will get what they asked for.\"[2] Eric Kohn, writing for indieWire, criticized the excessive grotesqueness of the film as well as Six's vanity. \"Well, what if it turns someone's own body against them—is that a measure of success? To some degree, yes; it's designed to turn the tables on its own gore-hungry fans by depicting a fictionalized version of one of their own so revolting they think twice about their twisted tendencies. But it's so indulgently perverse, and so viscerally disturbing to watch—not to mention a painfully vain exercise in self-worship—that the lesson is incredibly hard-won. Take a word of warning, if you're on the fence; you don't have to see The Human Centipede II to know you don't want to see it.\"[1] | Some reviewers found the extreme nature of the film boring. Robert Koehler, writing for Variety, found the gore so excessive it was boring and a form of lazy filmmaking. \"More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated; one, detailing the violent birth and death of a baby, is here simply to shock the most jaded of the jaded,\" he wrote.[6] | Reviewer Robert Saucedo of InsidePulse.com was more generous toward the film, but found its execution lacking. \"The film ... has a hint of intelligence hiding behind its beady little eyes. Smeared with blood and poo as it may be, this intelligence exposes a film that has something to say. The problem, unfortunately, is that director Tom Six is like a child – attempting to make a profound statement but unable to get it out eloquently or even in anything not resembling a whimper or a groan most of the time ... Who would have guessed? Human Centipede II is a treatise about horror fandom as delivered by a giggling, poop-infatuated toddler.\"[13] | Mark Olsen, film critic for the Los Angeles Times expressed concern over the film's conclusion as well as its basic premise. The conclusion (which he admits is open to interpretation; did Lomax commit these crimes or not?) leaves the audience either believing that the film is a \"cop-out repudiation of everything that has come prior\" or that even more graphic torture is coming in the third film.[44] Regardless, Olsen concluded that writer-director Six has left himself with no good option for the third film. | Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, who did not assign a star rating to the original, gave this film zero stars on review, calling it \"reprehensible, dismaying, ugly, artless and an affront to any notion, however remote, of human decency.\"[45] He would later name it the worst movie of 2011.[46]","m_production":"Director Tom Six stated in 2010 that he was working on a sequel to The Human Centipede (First Sequence), and a possible third film depending upon its success.[7] He said that the plot would follow on from the first film, but with a centipede made from 12 people as opposed to the three victims of the first film. The tag-line would be \"100% medically inaccurate\", in contrast to his \"100% medically accurate\" claim for the first film. Tom Six claimed the sequel would be much more graphic and disturbing, making the first film seem like \"My Little Pony compared with part two.\"[8] | Speculation regarding the plot of Full Sequence grew after the Weekend of Horrors convention in May 2010, when Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura, who had starred in First Sequence hinted that their characters, despite their deaths in First Sequence, might be returning for the sequel.[9] Additionally, Ashley C. Williams, whose character was left alive at the end of First Sequence, stated in September 2010 that she was shooting a horror film in Britain, which led to speculation from FEARnet that she would be reprising the role of Lindsay from the first film.[10] In a further interview, Ashlynn Yennie confirmed Six's claims that the sequel would contain \"the blood and shit\" which viewers did not see in the first film.[9] | Six was inspired to make the movie a metafilm after reporters kept asking him if he worried about people committing copycat crimes inspired by the first film. [11] Although he had previously considered the concept for a possible sequel this experience cemented his idea. [11] | According to Six, he intentionally made Full Sequence very different from First Sequence, due to two reasons. First, back when he was writing the script of First Sequence, he knew people would want more \"blood and shit\" than is shown, and second, the two parts reflect the two different characters: the coloured First Sequence, with a slow-moving camera, fit the story of Dr. Heiter, while Martin Lomax's character required a \"dark and dirty\" film. Six shot Full Sequence in colour, but \"was always thinking about black and white\" and realized while editing that it was \"much scarier\" in black and white.[12] It was also Six's idea to have little dialogue in the film's second half, except for moans, screams, and whimpers.[13] | Principal photography for Full Sequence began in London in June 2010 with a largely British cast.[14] A teaser trailer was released on 24 September, in which Six introduced Martin, a man wearing a cardboard box over his head, as the new doctor.[15]","m_sequel":"Six has revealed that the third film will again be very different from the previous entry, but will also start with its ending, making the trilogy similar to a centipede. In the end, the parts of the trilogy will form one continuous film about four and a half hours long. He also stated that the third film will answer some \"lasting questions\", will have a strange happy ending, and will be the last of the series as he does not want to do any more Centipede films.[12] In an interview with DreadCentral.com, Six said the third film will \"make the last one look like a Disney film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favorite... It's going to upset a lot of people.\" | As of January 2013, Dieter Laser and Six had ended their legal battle due to creative differences which had been ongoing since March 2012. Laser and Harvey were confirmed as returning for the third film. The film was to be set in America, would star a \"big American celebrity\", would have \"a storyline that nobody would expect\" and have a centipede consisting of 500+ people.[48] | Filming commenced in May 2013 with Eric Roberts added to the cast. Other cast members include former pornographic actress Bree Olson, Robert LaSardo, and Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister, Jr.. Filming concluded in June with part of the film taking place in a prison.
