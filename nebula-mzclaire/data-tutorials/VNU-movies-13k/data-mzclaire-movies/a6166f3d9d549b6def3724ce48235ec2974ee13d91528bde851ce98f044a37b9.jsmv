{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jim and Slim, a couple of workers at a chemical plant in the fictional New England town of Ravensback, decides to call it a day and head for the bar. Fortunately, a large buildup of pressure leaks from one of the pipes that starts to form a yellow toxic cloud that drifts across the ground. Meanwhile, a school bus is taking children home. After dropping one child off. There are only five children left on the bus: Paul MacKenize, Jenny Freemont, Ellen Chandler, Tommy Button, and Janet Shore. Cathy drives past the school bus and waves to the children as they are singing road songs. Suddenly the bus passes through the yellow toxic cloud. Cathy arrives home, but the school bus is detained somewhere. | After Billy Hart, the local sheriff, finds the idling bus abandoned near a cemetery and the children's possessions still on it, he radios to his deputy Harry Timmons and Molly, an older woman who works at the local general store and acts as the part-time police dispatcher. Paul's sister Suzie is seemingly a slutty blonde who's only interested in the dopey town deputy, Harry Timmons and tries to seduce him. Billy orders Timmons to set up a roadblock at the intersection of the main highway and the lone road leading into town, recruiting a couple of armed locals believing that the children were possibly kidnapped. | Meanwhile, Dr. Joyce Gould, Tommy's mother's female lover, who's hostile towards the sheriff for no reason goes with him to investigate. She hops on the school bus where she finds Tommy's things on board. She ends up at the cemetery goes looking for him when she heard her name called as she runs up to a nearby gravestone and falls over on the bus driver's badly burnt corpse. Soon after, Tommy approaches Joyce to give a him hug. When they embraced, Joyce suddenly screams as yellow steam comes from Tommy's hands and burns Joyce alive before Tommy finally releases her corroded body and trudges on. | Later, Ellen sneaks through the woods near a road where John Freemont, father of Jenny, is working on his car. Sheriff Hart gives him a lift home while Ellen watches them unnoticed and decides to move along and finally goes home where she encounters her mother, Rita runs to the door to Ellen's outstretched arms to hug her before being incinerated and roasted to death. Her father, Bob, then comes to the door and is shocked at the spectacle. Ellen goes to hug him, but he backs away from her into the house while she follows. | Paul MacKenize comes home and startles his sister. He then starts walking towards her with his arms outstretched while she backs away from him, she slaps him in the face, trying to rouse him from his apparent trance. They wind up in a workroom part of the house where off-camera, he kills her as she screams. Paul's father, Cyrus, is then killed after discovering Paul with her body. | While John and Billy on the road, they encounter Janet Shore standing in the middle of road who is dazed like the other zombified children, pale-faced and apparently stunned as they put her in the car to drive her home. It turns out that Janet has not yet fully transformed into a radioactive zombie, but she gradually changes into one during the ride (as evidenced by her fingernails shown turning black). After they stopped, she attacks Sheriff Hart who is able to dodge her while she flees the vicinity. | Eventually, the zombified Ellen, Tommy, and Paul meet and walk together to congregate. They are spotted by Deputy Timmons, who radios the station, but is soon killed. The three children converge in front of the general store where an overjoyed (and misguided) Molly comes outside to hug them, and is roasted to death as her screaming is heard on a police radio dispatcher by John and Billy. | Meanwhile, John and Billy are checking other homes in the area finding the occupants dead in much the same way. They go to John's home to meet his pregnant wife, Cathy and his younger son, Clarkie. They are relieved that Cathy and Clarkie are unharmed. John begins to give orders, but does not divulge any information to Cathy or Clarkie. | The five wandering little zombies approaches the house once they spot the people inside. Jenny appears and attempts to hug Cathy, but John runs out of the house in a panic and pulls her away in time. Meanwhile, Paul climbs to the upper level of the house and is let through the window by Clarkie (who does not realize what Paul is). They play a quiet game of tag after Clarkie hides in his closet as Paul kills him in typical form. | Billy shoots the zombies with his pistol, but the bullets have no effect on them. Cathy, still not aware of the children's zombified state, knocks Billy out with a glass object in order to stop him from shooting them. She then finds Clarkie's roasted body and tells John, who runs upstairs and tearfully puts the child's body back to bed. | Paul then attacks the adults, while Billy instinctively picks up a replica katana and chops off both Paul's hands as he howls in pain, which kills Paul while the fingernails on his severed hands reverts back to normal. Ellen then breaks through one of the windows with one hand, which is immediately severed by Billy causes her to apparently die. Billy and John then goes outside with the sword in hand to find the rest of the zombies. The remaining three zombies: Tommy, Janet, and Jenny converge at the upper level of the barn on the property where they are found by John and Billy who despites Jenny's pleas to John and are promptly dismembered and killed. | While an exhausted John collapses to the ground near the barn while Billy wearily goes to his car to radio for help, Ellen suddenly rises from the back seat who grabs Billy by the neck and roasts him to death. John hears Billy's screaming and approaches with his sword to finish Ellen off. He then flings his sword in disgust and collapses into a deep sleep next to Billy's corpse. | The next morning, Cathy yells to a still-sleeping John that \"it's time\". He wakes up and runs frantically into the house to help her deliver their third child. As they are delivering the baby, the camera pans over all of the dead bodies (except Clarkie's) and also showing Sheriff Hart's corpse. All five of the unfortunate children laying peacefully and hacked up. After the baby is delivered, John is aghast and wide-eyed as he notices that his newborn child has black fingernails while being breastfed.","m_cast":"Martin Shakar as John Freemont | Gil Rogers as Sheriff Billy Hart | Gale Garnett as Cathy Freemont | Shannon Bolin as Molly | Tracy Griswold as Deputy Harry Timmons | Joy Glaccum as Suzie MacKenzie | Jeptha Evans as Paul MacKenzie | Clara Evans as Jenny Freemont | Sarah Albright as Ellen Chandler | Nathanael Albright as Tommy Button | Julie Carrier as Janet Shore | Michelle Le Mothe as Dr. Joyce Gould | Edward Terry as Hank | Peter Maloney as Frank | Jessie Abrams as Clarkie Freemont | Rita Montone as Dee Dee Shore | John P.
