{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a misfit in the small town of Bodeen, Texas, with no sense of direction in her life. Her mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), a former beauty queen, pushes her to enter beauty pageants despite her lack of interest. During a shopping trip to Austin with her mother, Bliss encounters three roller derby team members and finds herself intrigued by the sport in which teams and players are given pun names that highlight the violent aspect of the sport. Intrigued, she and her friend Pash attend a roller derby bout under the pretense of going to a football game, where they see the \"Holy Rollers\" defeat the \"Hurl Scouts\", a perennially unsuccessful derby team. | Returning to Austin, Bliss lies about her age and tries out for the Hurl Scouts, discovering her natural skating abilities in the process. Joining the team, Bliss is given the derby name \"Babe Ruthless\" (a play on Babe Ruth). After realizing she needs to be ruthless in roller derby, Bliss also sees she needs to take charge in other aspects of her life. One involves Bliss' love interest, a lanky young rock guitarist and singer named Oliver (Landon Pigg) whom she meets via her exposure to roller derby. They enjoy a whirlwind romance before Oliver leaves for a tour, taking a T-shirt Bliss gave him to remember her by, in exchange for his jacket. She later finds a picture of him at a gig with another girl, who is wearing her T-shirt. She burns his jacket in retribution and subsequently breaks up with him following his return, although he vehemently denies that anything happened. | Another sub-plot examines Bliss' relationship with her parents, a loving but controlling mother and an amiable but clueless father (Daniel Stern) who seldom opposes his wife's parental decisions. Although, eventually, Bliss' father convinces her mother to let Bliss out of a pageant (which is at the same time as the championship roller derby game) and convinces the Hurl Scouts to come get Bliss for the bout. Various other sub-plots include her relationship with Pash, and confrontations with a stuck up snob at school. Pash is fine with Bliss' new path, until she gets arrested with an open container of beer while she is waiting for Bliss, who has left to go find Oliver. Eventually, Pash gets together with their manager and forgives Bliss. The movie ends with the Hurl Scouts narrowly losing the championship match and everyone finally getting along; the team chants \"We're number two!\" which was the same thing they chanted when they lost their first match.","m_cast":"Ellen Page as Bliss Cavendar (Babe Ruthless) (a play on Babe Ruth) | Alia Shawkat as Pash | Marcia Gay Harden as Brooke Cavendar | Daniel Stern as Earl Cavendar | Carlo Alban as Dwayne (Birdman) | Landon Pigg as Oliver | Jimmy Fallon as 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket | Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem | Zoë Bell as Bloody Holly (a play on Buddy Holly) | Eve as Rosa Sparks (a play on Rosa Parks) | Drew Barrymore as Smashley Simpson (a play on Ashlee Simpson) | Andrew Wilson as Razor | Juliette Lewis as Iron Maven (a play on Iron Maiden) | Ari Graynor as Eva Destruction (a play on Eve of Destruction) | Har Mar Superstar as Fight Attendants Coach","m_reception":"Critical reception for Whip It was generally positive; based on 176 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 85%, with an average score of 7.1/10.[10] Metacritic calculated an average score of 68, based on 31 reviews.[11] A. O. Scott called the film \"predictable\", but said \"You might, nonetheless, want to see this movie, even — or maybe especially — if you have seen Billy Elliot or Bend It Like Beckham. Familiarity is not always a bad thing, and if the script, by Shauna Cross, piles sports movie and coming-of-age touchstones into a veritable cairn of clichés, the cast shows enough agility and conviction to make them seem almost fresh.\"[12] Roger Ebert said it's a \"coming-together of two free spirits, Drew Barrymore and Ellen Page, and while it may not reflect the kind of female empowerment Gloria Steinem had in mind, it has guts, charm, and a black-and-blue sweetness.\"[13] According to The Miami Herald, \"Whip It is completely predictable from the first frame. It also is ridiculously, utterly entertaining. Drew Barrymore's smashing directorial debut harkens back to an era in which Hollywood studio pictures could still move and enthrall the audience while plying in hoary cliches.\"[14] | Whip It was a financial disappointment.[2][15][16] Initial studio estimates showed Whip It in a tie for #6 in its opening weekend, tying with the widely released Capitalism: A Love Story, and it wound up taking sixth place with $4,650,812.[17] The film grossed $13,043,363 in North America.
