{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Kelly Fairchild (Daphne Zuniga) is a university student who has suffered from a recurring nightmare in which a strange man is burning to death inside her childhood home. Adding to her stress, Kelly is also about to take part in her sorority's initiation ritual which entails her and a group of pledges breaking into her wealthy father's multi-level department store after hours. Megan, head of the sorority, comes up with the idea in hopes of getting Kelly into trouble, out of jealousy. Kelly, her friend Marcia (Marilyn Kagan), and roommate Alison (Hunter Tylo) are the three main pledges. | At a sanitarium miles away, several prisoners free themselves and murder a nurse. The following morning, Kelly's parents Frances (Vera Miles) and Dwight (Clu Gulager) receive a phone call from the sanitarium notifying them of the incident. That afternoon, Kelly pitches an idea for her term paper to Peter (James Read), the graduate assistant in her psychology course. Kelly explains her dream to Peter, and tells how she had lost memory of her early childhood after falling out of a treehouse, leaving her with injuries that put her into a coma. At dinner, Frances forbids Kelly's meetings with Peter, who is attempting to analyze her nightmare. | Meanwhile, while Dwight is outside starting his car, he is attacked and brutally killed by an unseen assailant. Frances goes outside and sees Dwight's car driving down the road, assuming he left the house. The night at the department store, the night porter is murdered while doing rounds. Shortly after, Kelly, Marcia, and Alison arrive there to steal the porter's uniform for their initiation pledge. The three split up, and Kelly heads to the lounge upstairs to get one of the spare uniforms. Meanwhile, Megan lets Chad, Ralph, and Andy into the department store to scare the girls by rolling a bowling ball down the hallway; the girls then attempt to leave the store, but find themselves locked inside. Meanwhile, Megan and Andy kiss inside one of the shops and later begin playing hide and seek. Shortly, the killer kills Andy and Megan in various areas of the store. Kelly and Marcia hear the commotion, and run into Ralph and Chad who are hiding in a dressing room. | At the university, Peter comes across newspaper clippings detailing the fire Kelly described in her dream; the articles reveal the burning man's identity as Jason Randall, a floor manager at the Fairchild department store who was married to France. He believes Kelly's dream to be a memory of her biological father, Jason, being burned in an altercation with Frances' lover Dwight, whom Kelly believes to be her real father. A recent article on the inmates' revolt at the sanitarium reveals Jason being a groundskeeper and one of the prisoners that escaped. | Stuck inside the store, Kelly, Marcia, and Alison drink wine together with Ralph and Chad. Alison and Chad leave to use the bathroom, before Alison discovers the night porter's body. Panicked, she runs into the men's bathroom to get Chad, only to find him dead in a bathroom stall. Kelly goes into the bathroom to investigate upon seeing her name written with blood on the mirror, while a frantic Alison goes downstairs to a security desk where she is viciously stabbed to death and her screams broadcast over the store's intercom system. Meanwhile, Peter drives to the Fairchild house to tell Frances the police have just notified Dwight's body discovered inside his car parked two blocks from his department store. | At the store, Ralph is shot dead with a harpoon gun in front of Marcia, who flees to find Kelly. They hide in a freight elevator inside the building which is infiltrated by the killer, who pulls Marcia into the elevator shaft as the doors close. Kelly escapes and flees into the store's boiler room where she finds Marcia's corpse being dragged away by the killer and encounters the burned Jason Randall. He chases her to the roof, and she pushes him off, killing him. Peter and Frances arrive at the store and find Jason's body outside. Inside, Peter sees who he believes to be Kelly standing in the store foyer and embraces her before she then stabs him in the stomach. Kelly runs into the room and is faced with a reflection of herself; her disturbed twin sister Terry, who had been institutionalized as a child when Frances left their father and married Dwight and whom Kelly has no memory of. Just as Terry is about to murder Kelly, she is shot to death by Frances. The film ends as Peter is taken away in an ambulance, while Kelly stares at her mother in disbelief.","m_cast":"Vera Miles as Frances Fairchild | Clu Gulager as Dwight Fairchild | Daphne Zuniga as Kelly Fairchild | James Read as Peter Adams | Marilyn Kagan as Marcia | Robert Dowdell as Jason Randall | Patti Heider as Nurse Higgins | Frances Peterson as Megan | Hunter Tylo as Alison (as Deborah Moreheart) | Paula Knowles as Beth | Trey Stroud as Ralph | Peter Malof as Andy | Christopher Bradley as Chad | Joy Jones as Heidi | Mary Davis Duncan as Gwen","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Initiation was filmed on location in Dallas, Texas in early 1984.[3] The multi-level Dallas Market Center served as the location for the Fairchild department store.[4][5] The film marked star Daphne Zuniga's debut in a leading role.
