{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":"Ben Affleck as Neil | Olga Kurylenko as Marina | Rachel McAdams as Jane | Javier Bardem as Father Quintana | Tatiana Chiline as Tatiana | Charles Baker as Charles | Romina Mondello as Anna","m_reception":"The film received mixed reviews from critics.[22] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 46% approval rating based on 156 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7 out of 10, with the consensus, \"To the Wonder demonstrates Terrence Malick's gift for beautiful images, but its narrative is overly somber and emotionally unsatisfying.\"[5] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[22] | To the Wonder was the final film reviewed by Roger Ebert prior to his death on April 4, 2013. His review was published two days later. He awarded it three and a half out of four stars, stating a \"more conventional film would have assigned a plot to these characters and made their motivations more clear. Malick, who is surely one of the most romantic and spiritual of filmmakers, appears almost naked here before his audience, a man not able to conceal the depth of his vision.\"[23] | Several reviewers welcomed the religious themes of the film.[24][25][26] Dawn LaValle, writing for First Things, summarizes: \"To the Wonder startles us into realizing that the world is shot through, positively charged, with [divine] presence. Whether that presence is fructifying love or slinking destruction stands as an accusing question throughout the film.\"[27] Likewise, the Jury who award To the Wonder the SIGNIS Award at the Venice Film Festival, said of the film: \"The film’s rich composition, textured direction, and its use of light bring together elements of divinity and humanity ultimately creating a sacramental experience which reveals God’s gift of unconditional love.\"[4]","m_production":"When announced in February 2010, the film was set to co-star Christian Bale.[6] Bale ultimately dropped out of the production and was replaced by Ben Affleck; Rachel McAdams also joined the cast.[7] | As with its predecessor, The Tree of Life, and its successor, Knight of Cups, the film's conception and plot stem from autobiographical elements: Terrence Malick met his second wife Michèle Morette in Paris in the early 1980s, and the couple lived in Oklahoma for a period prior to their separation.[8] | When the film entered production it did not have a title, and was referred to by the crew as Project D.[9] Filming took place primarily in Bartlesville and Pawhuska, Oklahoma, the latter the center of the Osage Nation, and began in September 2010.[10][11] Additional shooting took place in early 2011 in Bartlesville and Paris, France.[12][13] | Malick and his crew adopted an experimental approach. Actors described working without a screenplay or the use of lights.[12][14] Olga Kurylenko described the shooting process as more like a dance performance than traditional acting, stating: “What he always said was, ‘Keep moving, keep moving. Don’t stop.’ If I ever stopped, he’d poke me to keep going.”[15] Likewise, cinematographer on the film, Emmanuel Lubezki, was given instructions to be “in the eye of the hurricane” — in the middle of a scene, constantly interacting with the characters.[15] Lubezki called the film \"abstract\", and described it as being less tied to theatrical conventions and more purely cinematic than any prior film directed by Malick.[9] | Malick handed out works of literature to his editing team for inspiration, such as Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Walker Percy's The Moviegoer.[15] Also referenced to his editors was a phrase found in Margaret A. Doody’s introduction to Samuel Richardson’s 1740 novel Pamela. The phrase, \"radiant zigzag becoming\", became an unofficial motto for the film's editing team during post-production.[15] Also referenced during the editing of the film were the French New Wave films Jules and Jim by Traffuat (whose score was used as part of a temp soundtrack) and Godard's Breathless, Pierrot le Fou, and Vivre Sa Vie.[15] They were chosen for their elliptical narrative and editing styles which Malick hoped his editing team would embrace.[15] | Typical of a Malick project, a lot of actors who worked on the film were eventually cut during post-production. Jessica Chastain, Rachel Weisz, Amanda Peet, Barry Pepper and Michael Sheen were originally part of the film, but no footage of their performances were kept for the final cut.[16]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Terrence Malick","m_produced_by":"Sarah Green | Nicolas Gonda","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ben Affleck | Olga Kurylenko | Rachel McAdams | Javier Bardem","m_music_by":"Hanan Townshend","m_cinematography":"Emmanuel Lubezki","m_edited_by":"A.
