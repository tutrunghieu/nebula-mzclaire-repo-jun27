Flynn. Voight was a nominee for Best Actor but lost out to Dustin Hoffman for his role in Kramer vs. Kramer. | The Champ has also been called \"the saddest movie in the world\", and the final scene has been used in numerous psychology experiments to elicit a strong emotional response. According to Smithsonian magazine two psychologists, Robert Levenson and James Gross, conducted a study of more than 250 movie clips, and subjected them to 500 subjects in 1988, and concluded the last three minutes of the movie, where \"T.J.\" sees his father win in his comeback fight only to witness his death in the dressing room afterwards, elicited the saddest response from a majority of the subjects. In the scene the grief-stricken \"T.J.\" is inconsolable tugging his father's body while crying out \"Champ, wake up. Please wake up, Champ.\"[5][6] | Dave Grusin's score was nominated for an Oscar at the 52nd Academy Awards.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Franco Zeffirelli","m_produced_by":"Dyson Lovell","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jon Voight Faye Dunaway Ricky Schroder","m_music_by":"Dave Grusin","m_cinematography":"Fred J.
