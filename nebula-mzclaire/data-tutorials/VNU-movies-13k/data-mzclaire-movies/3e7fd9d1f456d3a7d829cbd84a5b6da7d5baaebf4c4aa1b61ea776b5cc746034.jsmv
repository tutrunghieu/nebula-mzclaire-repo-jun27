The film is about a filmmaker who recalls his life and his loves - the inspirations for his films - while attending a retrospective of his work.[2] Allen considers this to be one of his best films, along with The Purple Rose of Cairo and Match Point.[3] The film is shot in black and white and is reminiscent of Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963), which it parodies. | The film was nominated for a Writers Guild of America award for Best Comedy written directly for screen. Allen denies that this film is autobiographical and has expressed regret that audiences interpreted it as such.[4] \"[Critics] thought that the lead character was me,\" the director is quoted as saying in Woody Allen on Woody Allen.[5] \"Not a fictional character but me, and that I was expressing hostility towards my audience. That was in no way the point of the film. It was about a character who is obviously having a sort of nervous breakdown and, in spite of success, has come to a point in his life where he is having a bad time.\" |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"STARDUST MEMORIES (AA)\".
