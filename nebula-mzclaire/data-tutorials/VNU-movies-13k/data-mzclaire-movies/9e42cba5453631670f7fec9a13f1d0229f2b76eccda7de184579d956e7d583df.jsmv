The film stars Ralph Fiennes as the tortured Heathcliff and Juliette Binoche as the free-spirited Catherine Earnshaw, in a precursor to their later, successful collaboration on The English Patient. The role of Heathcliff opened up doors for Ralph Fiennes to play Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. American director Steven Spielberg claimed he liked Fiennes for Goeth because of his \"dark sexuality.\" | This particular film is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Wuthering Heights (1992).
