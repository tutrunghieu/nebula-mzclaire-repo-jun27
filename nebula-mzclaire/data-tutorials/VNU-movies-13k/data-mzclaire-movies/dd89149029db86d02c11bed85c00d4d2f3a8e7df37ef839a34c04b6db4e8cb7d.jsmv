{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A 17-year-old farmhand from rural New York State, Dean Youngblood (Rob Lowe) has dreams of playing in the National Hockey League. Dean voices these dreams to his father, but receives negative feedback, and it is not until his brother, Kelly convinces their father to let him try that he is granted the chance to travel to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs. At the try-outs, Youngblood demonstrates the abilities which garnered him \"92 goals in the New York League\" but also displays a lack of physical toughness that is so prized in Canadian junior hockey. This perceived weakness is pounced upon by a brutish player, Carl Racki (George J. Finn), who is also trying out for the team and engages him in a fight. Youngblood quickly learns that flashiness and pure athletic ability will not be enough to be successful in this league. Despite being one-punched by Racki, the coach opts to select Youngblood for a spot on the team. He ingratiates himself to the other players through a hazing ritual in which members of the Mustangs pin Youngblood down, and Captain Derek Sutton (Patrick Swayze) shaves his testicles. Youngblood has his first run in with the coach's daughter Jessie (Cynthia Gibb), after this incident, and an early attraction is felt. Following the incident Youngblood further bonds with the team through drinking at the local bar and having two of his teammates, including the Québécois goalie, Heaver (Keanu Reeves), who is seduced by his new landlady Miss McGill (Fionnula Flanagan). | After his mentor and friend on the team, Derek Sutton, is brutally injured by Racki (now with the rival Thunder Bay Bombers), Youngblood returns home to the farm out of fear, sadness, and disgust. After a pep-talk by his older brother Kelly (Jim Youngs) about the nature of never quitting and always standing up for yourself, Youngblood is inspired to learn how to fight and survive on the ice and adopt the killer instinct that has been stopping him from being successful. Youngblood returns to the team a new man, ready to confront Racki in the final game of the Memorial Cup playoffs between his team and the Thunder Bay Bombers. | The game ends with a dramatic, game-winning penalty shot goal by Youngblood with 3 seconds left; yet it is far from over as Youngblood demands to his coach, Murray Chadwick (Ed Lauter) to be left in the game as time expires to confront Racki. \"Let's go, Pretty Boy!\" says Youngblood as he and Racki engage in a violent fight to the finish with teammates and crowd including Youngblood's father Blane (Eric Nesterenko) and girlfriend Jessie (Coach Chadwick's daughter), cheering him on. The fight starts with both Youngblood and Racki using their sticks as swords until Youngblood knocks Racki's stick out of his hands. Youngblood and Racki then fight bare-handed. Youngblood emerges victorious, landing several blows to the face and body of his nemesis Racki, and is carried off the ice on the shoulders of his teammates in celebration.","m_cast":"Rob Lowe as Dean Youngblood | Patrick Swayze as Derek Sutton | Cynthia Gibb as Jessie Chadwick | Eric Nesterenko as Blane Youngblood | Ed Lauter as Murray Chadwick | Keanu Reeves as Heaver | George Finn as Carl Racki (billed as George J.
