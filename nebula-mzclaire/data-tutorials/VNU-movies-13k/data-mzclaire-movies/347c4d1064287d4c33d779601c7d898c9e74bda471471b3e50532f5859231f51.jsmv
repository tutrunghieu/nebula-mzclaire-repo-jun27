She takes a part-time job as a secretary to an ex-bootlegger and horse-playing gambler by the name of Rocco. He's a Broadway nightclub owner with a heart of gold who falls in love with Anne. However, he knows he's too old for her, so keeps his feelings to himself. | Anne \"thinks\" she's in love with his younger partner Tony Armotti, a typical playboy type who is afraid to fall in love because it might mean marriage. Tony lives in a walkup apartment above the nightclub, where he often entertains beautiful women. The stairs to the apartment are on the alley behind the club. | The entire nightclub loves Anne but Tony resents her because he wants to take care of her and protect her. Eventually after confronting Tony, Anne quits because Tony tells her he does not love her and never will. After she quits the entire nightclub patronizes Tony over whether Anne quit or was fired. He goes to where she is currently working and, after helping her escape when police raid the gambling den, convinces her to take back the job she quit.","m_cast":"Jean Simmons – Anne Leeds | Paul Douglas – Rocco | Anthony Franciosa – Tony Armotti | Julie Wilson – Ivy Corlane | Neile Adams – Patsy St. Clair | Joan Blondell – Crystal St. Clair | J.
