{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Italy in the Fifties. The image of grandeur and opulence, brought by the arrival of American troops in 1944, still has its effect on many young Italians. One of them is Ferdinand \"Nando\" Mericoni (Alberto Sordi), a connoisseur of the American world as represented in American cinema of which he is fervent devotee. Believing his future lies beyond the Atlantic, Nando moves to Rome, americanizing his life by imitating the sounds of American language and trying to recreate a Hollywood setting in his room, in his antics which leave a trail of victims, especially his now desperate parents, and his girlfriend Elvira (Maria Pia Casilio), who, probably allured by his manner, loves him despite everything. | Nando wears a studded leather bracelet, belt from herdsman, tight white t-shirt, jeans and baseball cap tube, refers to his loved ones in what he considers American terms (Elvy,papi, mami ) but also lives out everyday situations as though they were scenes in an American film in which he is the main actor. | After several misadventures, he finds his only recourse suggested by a famous film of the time, Fourteen Hours by Henry Hathaway, then he climbs the Colosseum and threatens to kill himself if someone will not help him get to the United States. After endless hours on top of the monument, Nando's dream seems to materialize with the arrival of the American ambassador. The ambassador promises him a journey to the United States and a job there to persuade him to come down, but once Nando comes down the ambassador attacks him furiously. Nando, hospitalized, recognizes the hopelessness of his dreams and desires, but in his heart he will still remain an irreducible American in Rome.","m_cast":"Alberto Sordi: Nando Mericoni (Santy Bailor) | Maria Pia Casilio: Elvira (Elvy) | Giulio Calì: Father of Nando | Anita Durante: Mother of Nando | Ilse Petersen: Molly, the American painter | Vincenzo Talarico: On.
