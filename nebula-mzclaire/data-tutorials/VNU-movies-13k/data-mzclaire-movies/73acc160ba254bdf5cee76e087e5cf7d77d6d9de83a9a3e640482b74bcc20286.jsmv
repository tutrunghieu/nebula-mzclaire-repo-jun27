{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"1925: an American archeologist, Desmond Jordan moves to Africa, seeking the \"Speaking Mountain\". This brings him into the middle of the Sahara desert, where he meets some deserters from the French Foreign Legion. Jordan escapes with Orso (Bear) from a siege by Ryker, a lieutenant of the battalion and moves towards the mountain. Ryker and El Hallem, head of local tribes, pursue Jordan, who has gone blind approaching the mountain. The lieutenant gives vent to his violence, murdering some locals and sparing only their queen, Anthea. Later she cures Jordan's blindness and, together with El Hallem (redeemed), helps the archeologist to defeat Ryker. Eventually, Jordan helps Anthea and Orso discover the secret of the mountain, an alien power that arrived with their ancestors from the stars thousands of years before.","m_cast":"Michael York - Desmond Jordan | James Farentino - Caliph of Timbuktu | Ben Kingsley - Sholomon | Andie MacDowell - Anthea | David Soul - Lieutenant Riker | Miguel Bosé - El Hallem | Daniel Olbrychski - Hared | Diego Abatantuono - Orso | Delia Boccardo - Yasmine | Ana Obregón - Tamameth | Radost Bokel - Parizade | William McNamara - Philip Jordan | Itaco Nardulli - Kerim | Mathilda May - Myriam | Jean-Pierre Cassel - Major De Brosse","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The filming was done mainly in Morocco. | The original soundtrack is by Ennio Morricone; the main theme is Saharan Dream performed by Amii Stewart.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":null,"m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":null,"m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":null,"m_country":null,"m_language":null,"m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":null,"m_external_link":"The Secret of the Sahara at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":null,"m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
