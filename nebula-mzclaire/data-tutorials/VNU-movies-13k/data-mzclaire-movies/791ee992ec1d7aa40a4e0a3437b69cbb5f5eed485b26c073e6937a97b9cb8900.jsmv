It approaches narrative in much the same way, which would be more of a problem if the film were not so enjoyably loose-jointed anyhow . . . [It] tends to drift, but it has good humor and an easygoing appeal, not to mention a thoroughly attractive cast.\" [2] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars. He felt the screenplay \"seems to meander in whatever direction the filmmakers thought they could find an inspiration\" but added, \"And yet the film is not without merit. All of the performances are interesting, and although I was not surprised that three of the four leads were good, I was surprised at how effective Don Johnson was in his role. It's the best thing he's done, and shows he can do good things.\" He concluded, \"There were times when I thought I'd seen this movie before – maybe in The Four Seasons by Alan Alda or, for that matter, in any film by Alda. Made by sensitive, sophisticated middle-age men about sensitive middle-age men who are a little less sophisticated, the movie drips with nostalgia, but sometimes what everybody seems to want isn't love, but a gift certificate at L.L. Bean. The lifestyle itself threatens to upstage the drama, and as the wholesome New Englanders go about their wholesome New England pastimes, even suffering begins to look picturesque.\" [3] | Rita Kempley of the Washington Post described the film as \"thirtysomething in needlepoint\" and commented, \"With its comfortable characters and small-town setting, it's as homey as hash – almost as if the director just threw it together like a housewife with unexpected company. It's not a grand movie, but an enjoyable midlife comedy that features Don Johnson in a breakthrough performance.\" [4] | The movie was not a box office success.[5]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Greenwald","m_produced_by":"Jeffrey Lurie","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Don Johnson | Susan Sarandon | Jeff Daniels | Elizabeth Perkins | Kate Reid | Justin Henry","m_music_by":"Richard Gibbs","m_cinematography":"Tak Fujimoto","m_edited_by":"Robert Florio Janet Bartels-Vandagriff","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"TriStar Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 23, 1988","m_running_time":"101 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$9 million","m_box_office":"$3,790,493 [1] | Sweet Hearts Dance is a 1988 American comedy drama film directed by Robert Greenwald.
