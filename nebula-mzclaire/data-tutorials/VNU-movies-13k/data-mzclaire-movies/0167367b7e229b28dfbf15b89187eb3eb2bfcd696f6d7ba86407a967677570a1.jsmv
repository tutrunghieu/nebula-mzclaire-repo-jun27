{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In a small town in British Columbia a school bus skids into a lake, killing 14 children. The grieving parents are approached by a lawyer, Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), who is haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his drug-addict daughter. Stephens persuades the reluctant parents to file a class action lawsuit against the province, school district, or other entity for damages, arguing that the accident is a result of negligence. | The case depends on the few surviving witnesses to say the right things in court; particularly Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), a 15-year-old now paralyzed from the waist down. Before the accident, Nicole was an aspiring songwriter and was being sexually abused by her father, Sam (Tom McCamus). | One bereaved parent, Billy Ansel, distrusts Stephens and pressures Sam to drop the case; Nicole overhears their argument. In the pretrial deposition, Nicole unexpectedly accuses the bus driver Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose) of speeding, halting the lawsuit. Stephens and Nicole's father know she is lying but can do nothing. Two years later, Stephens sees Driscoll working as a bus driver in a city.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film received overwhelming critical acclaim upon its release.
