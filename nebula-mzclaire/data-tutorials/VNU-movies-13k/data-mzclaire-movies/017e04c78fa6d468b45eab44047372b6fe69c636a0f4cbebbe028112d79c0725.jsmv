{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Salvatore Giuliano, the infamous bandit, together with his rag-tag band of guerrillas, attempted to liberate early 1950s Sicily from Italian rule and make it an American state. Giuliano robs from the rich conservative landowners to give to the peasants, who in turn hail him as their savior. As his popularity grows, so does his ego, and he eventually thinks he is above the power of his backer, Mafia Don Masino Croce. The Don, in turn, sets out to kill the upstart by convincing his cousin and closest adviser Gaspare to assassinate him.","m_cast":"Christopher Lambert as Salvatore Giuliano | Terence Stamp as Prince Borsa | Joss Ackland as Don Masino Croce | John Turturro as Gaspare \"Aspanu\" Pisciotta | Barbara Sukowa as Camilla, Duchess of Crotone | Richard Bauer as Hector Adonis | Giulia Boschi as Giovanna Ferra | Ray McAnally as Trezza | Barry Miller as Dr. Nattore | Andreas Katsulas as Passatempa | Michael Wincott as Cpl.

Many critics criticized the film's incoherent narrative, muddy visual style, and the casting of Lambert in the lead as Giuliano. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave The Sicilian \"two thumbs down\". Ebert complained about the cinematography: \"The film alternates between scenes that are backlit where you can't see the faces and other scenes that were so murky that you couldn't see who was talking.\" Siskel attacked the film's star, \"Let me just go after Christopher Lambert... because here is the center of the film. This would be as if the Al Pacino character in The Godfather were played by a member of the walking dead.\"[11] In his Chicago Sun-Times review, Ebert claimed The Sicilian continues director Michael Cimino's \"record of making an incomprehensible mess out of every other film he directs.\"[12] | Vincent Canby of The New York Times said, \"Cimino's fondness for amber lighting and great, sweeping camera movements are evident from time to time, but the film is mostly a garbled synopsis of the Puzo novel.\"[13] Variety added \"Cimino seems to be aiming for an operatic telling of the short career of the violent 20th-century folk hero [based on Mario Puzo's novel], but falls into an uncomfortable middle ground between European artfulness and stock Hollywood conventions.\"[14] Hal Hinson of the Washington Post felt it was \"unambiguously atrocious, but in that very special, howlingly grandiose manner that only a filmmaker with visions of epic greatness working on a large scale with a multinational cast can achieve.\"[15] Leonard Maltin rated the film a \"BOMB\", calling it a \"militantly lugubrious bio of Salvatore Giuliano\".[16] | Producer McNall was personally disappointed by the film. \"Given that The Sicilian was a descendant of Puzo's The Godfather,\" wrote McNall, \"I had expected something with the same beauty, drama, and emotion. Cimino had shown with The Deer Hunter that he was capable of making such a movie. But he had failed.\" McNall even quoted Ebert's review in his appraisal of The Sicilian, \"Ebert criticized the cast, the cinematography, the script, even the sound quality. He was right about all of it.\"[10] | Rotten Tomatoes gives The Sicilian a 13% \"Rotten\" rating, based on 16 reviews.[17]","m_production":"Due to the huge success of The Godfather, Mario Puzo was given $1 million for the movie rights to his novel The Sicilian.[2] David Begelman, head of Gladden Entertainment at the time, hired Michael Cimino to direct.[2] When producer Bruce McNall met with Cimino at a dinner in Los Angeles, he complained loudly about the script and Begelman's interference with casting.[3] Cimino wanted Christopher Lambert for the lead role and Begelman was concerned about a French actor starring in a movie about an Italian hero in an English-speaking movie.[3] To move forward, Begelman and McNall gave Cimino what he wanted with regards to the script and casting.[4] | Gore Vidal did some uncredited rewrite work on the film. Vidal sued both screenwriter Steve Shagan and the Writer's Guild of America to receive screenplay credit. \"I was defrauded of my work.\"[5] Vidal eventually won the suit against WGA.[6] In the DVD commentary of Year of the Dragon, Cimino said he learned a lot from working with Vidal.[7] | The film was shot on location in Sicily in the spring and summer of 1986.[2] In late April 1986, Begelman and McNall discovered that the film was over budget and behind schedule. The problems involved mostly hang-ups with personnel and equipment, nothing on the scale of Cimino's Heaven's Gate. One exception was some low-level Mafia men who controlled certain locations and union workers. Cimino suggested that Begelman and McNall meet with Mafia men to overcome the impasse. Upon meeting them in a restaurant off the main piazza, the producers discovered that the Mafia men wanted to appear in the film. \"Once we all understood,\" wrote McNall, \"the fix was easy. There were plenty of little roles for walk-ons and extras. And if a real role didn't exist, we could pretend to involve some of the guys and throw them a day's pay.\" Once the problem was solved, Cimino had access to the countryside and the local labor pool.[4] | After location work was finished, Cimino took the footage straight to his editing room to begin cutting. Cimino did not report any of his progress on the editing as the months passed until he delivered a 150-minute cut of the film and declared that he was done. Under his contract with the producers, Cimino had the right to final cut as long as the film was under 120 minutes long. Cimino insisted that no more cuts could be made and pressed Begelman and McNall to present the current version to 20th Century Fox, the film's domestic distributor. Before viewing the film, the Fox executives said to the producers that the film was so long that it limited the number of showings a theater could present each day. It had to be trimmed or Fox wouldn't release it.[8] | When Begelman and McNall relayed Fox's ruling to Cimino, he exploded. \"I've been cutting for six months. There's nothing more to take out!\" he shouted. The producers responded that there had to be a way to tell the story in 120 minutes. Cimino answered, \"Fine! You want it shorter, you got it.\" A few days later, Cimino delivered a new version of the film in which all of the action scenes were cut out. \"In the script a big wedding scene in the mountains is followed by an attack on the wedding party.\" wrote McNall. \"In what we saw the wedding was followed by a scene at a hospital, where all the people in nice clothes were being treated for their wounds. He just cut out the battle.\" Begelman did not wait till the film ended to get on the phone and immediately called Cimino. Cimino said that his contract allowed him final cut in a 120-minute film and what he gave them qualified.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Sicilian by Mario Puzo","m_directed_by":"Michael Cimino","m_produced_by":"Joann Carelli Michael Cimino Bruce McNall Sidney Beckerman (executive producer)","m_screenplay_by":"Steve Shagan Gore Vidal (uncredited)","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Christopher Lambert | Terence Stamp | Joss Ackland | John Turturro | Richard Bauer","m_music_by":"David Mansfield","m_cinematography":"Alex Thomson","m_edited_by":"Françoise Bonnot","m_production_company":"Gladden Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"October 23, 1987 (1987-10-23) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"115 minutes (theatrical) 146 minutes (director's cut)","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English Italian","m_budget":"$16.5 million (Estimated)[a 1]","m_box_office":"$5,406,879 (Domestic)[1] | The Sicilian is a 1987 action film based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo.
