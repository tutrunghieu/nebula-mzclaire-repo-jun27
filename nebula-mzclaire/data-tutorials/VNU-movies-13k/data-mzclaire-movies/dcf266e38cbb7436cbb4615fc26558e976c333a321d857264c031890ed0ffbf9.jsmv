{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Oreste Jacovacci from Rome and Giovanni Busacca from Milan meet each other during the call to arms at the start of World War I. Although completely different in character, they are united in their lack of idealism and their desire to avoid any danger and get out of the war unscathed. They and a varied group of civilians and fellow soldiers (including the prostitute Costantina, played by Silvana Mangano) go through many ups and downs during their training, battles and rare moments of leave. They are considered \"inefficient\" due to their limited military valour and so are made message-runners to the staff, a very dangerous job. Having succeeded in their mission, a sudden change in which side hold which trench leaves them in enemy territory, where they are captured by the Austrians wearing Austrian uniforms they had found in a barn. | They are accused of espionage and condemned to be shot by firing squad. Overcome with fear, they let slip that they are in possession of information crucial to the success of the battle and that they have decided to change sides to save their lives. The Austrian officials' arrogance and a contemptuous joke against the Italians (\"...courage?! Liver they say... That those in the know only eat liver with onions, and we'll soon eat that! [referring to the occupation of Venice where the dish is traditional]\") give the pair new strength and dignity sufficient to keep the information secret right up until their execution - First Giovanni Busacca refuse to give any informations and insult the Austrian officer then, when Busacca was sent to face the firing squad, also Jacovacci refuse pretending Busacca was the only one to have the informations. The battle then ends in an Italian victory, without anyone knowing of the pair's sacrifice.","m_cast":"Alberto Sordi: Oreste Jacovacci | Vittorio Gassman: Giovanni Busacca | Silvana Mangano: Costantina | Folco Lulli: Bordin | Bernard Blier: Captain Castelli | Romolo Valli: Lieutenant Gallina | Vittorio Sanipoli: Major Venturi | Nicola Arigliano: Giardino | Geronimo Meynier: Messenger | Mario Valdemarin: Lorenzi | Elsa Vazzoler: Bordin's wife | Tiberio Murgia: Rosario Nicotra | Livio Lorenzon: Sergeant Barriferri | Ferruccio Amendola: De Concini | Gianni Baghino: a soldier | Carlo D'Angelo: Captain Ferri | Achille Compagnoni: chaplain | Luigi Fainelli: Giacomazzi | Marcello Giorda: the general | Tiberio Mitri: Mandich | Gérard Herter: Austrian captain | Guido Celano: Italian major","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was born out of an idea by Luciano Vincenzoni, influenced by \"Two friends\", a story by Guy de Maupassant. Initially thought of as a star vehicle just for Gassman, it was the producer De Laurentiis who decided to add another character, played by Sordi. The screenplay combined characters and situations from two famous books - \"A Year on the Plateau\" by Emilio Lussu and “Con me e con gli alpini” by Piero Jahier. In an interview, the director himself stated: | Lussu and Jahier are considered as the film's two screenwriters. In particular I turned to Lussu, saying that he deserved to be rewarded for the borrowings from his book, but (perhaps because he was convinced Italian comedy was rubbish) he told me that he would have nothing to do with it and we could realise the film just as we liked[8] | The journalist and writer Carlo Salsa, who had actually fought in these areas in the First World War, was a script consultant, helping with the story, dialogue and background, all particularly vivid and original. The scenes were mostly shot in the province of Udine, at Gemona del Friuli, near Venzone, at Sella Sant'Agnese, in the fort at Palmanova and in the Nespoledo district of Lestizza from 25 May to mid June 1959. Other scenes were filmed in Campania at San Pietro Infine.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mario Monicelli","m_produced_by":"Dino De Laurentiis","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Alberto Sordi Vittorio Gassman Silvana Mangano Romolo Valli","m_music_by":"Nino Rota","m_cinematography":"Giuseppe Rotunno, Leonida Barboni, Roberto Gerardi, Giuseppe Serrandi","m_edited_by":"Adriana Novelli","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"September 1959 (1959-09) (premiere at VFF) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"135 minutes","m_country":"Italy/France","m_language":"Italian | The Great War (Italian: La grande guerra) is a 1959 Italian film directed by Mario Monicelli.
