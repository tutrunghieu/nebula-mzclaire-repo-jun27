{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Introduced by Tom Wingfield as a memory play, it is based on his recollection of his disillusioned and delusional mother Amanda and her shy, crippled daughter Laura. Amanda's husband abandoned the family long ago, and her memory of her days as a genteel Southern belle surrounded by devoted beaux may be more romanticized than real. Tom is an aspiring writer who works in a warehouse to support his family, and the banality and boredom of everyday life leads him to spend most of his spare time watching movies in local cinemas at all hours of the night. Amanda is obsessed with finding a proper \"gentleman caller\" for Laura, who spends most of her time with her collection of glass animal figurines. To appease his mother, Tom eventually brings Jim O'Connor home for dinner, but complications arise when Laura realizes he is the man she loved in high school and has thought of ever since. He dashes her hopes of a future together when he announces he is engaged. Infuriated, Amanda lashes out at her son for raising his sister's hopes and Tom leaves, never to return to his family.","m_cast":"Joanne Woodward as Amanda Wingfield | John Malkovich as Tom Wingfield | Karen Allen as Laura Wingfield | James Naughton as Jim O'Connor","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Paul Newman","m_produced_by":"Burtt Harris","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Joanne Woodward John Malkovich Karen Allen James Naughton","m_music_by":"Henry Mancini","m_cinematography":"Michael Ballhaus","m_edited_by":"David Ray","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Cineplex Odeon Films","m_release_dates":"October 23, 1987 (1987-10-23) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"134 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English | The Glass Menagerie is a 1987 American drama film directed by Paul Newman.
