{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film, which claims to be a true story, sets out to detail the existence of the \"Fouke Monster,\" a seven foot tall Bigfoot-like creature that has reportedly been seen by residents of a small Arkansas community since the 1950s. It is described as being completely covered in reddish-brown hair, leaving three-toed tracks, and having a foul odor. | Several locals from the small town of Fouke, Arkansas, recall their stories, often appearing as themselves, claiming that the creature has killed several large hogs, as well as other animals. One farmer claims that the beast carried off his 300 lbs boar with little effort, even leaping a fence with the pig tucked under its arm. In one scene, a kitten is shown as having been \"scared to death\" by the creature. The narrator informs the audience that while people have shot at the creature in the past, it has always managed to escape. In another scene, hunters attempt to pursue the creature with dogs, but the dogs refuse to give chase. Strange, otherworldly howls can be heard coming from the Boggy Creek area just outside Fouke. A police constable states that while driving home one night, the creature suddenly ran across the road in front of him. | In a later sequence, culled from the actual newspaper accounts inspiring the film, the creature is shown menacing a family in a remote country house. After being fired upon, the creature attacks, sending one family member hurling through the front door of their home, before being rushed to the hospital. | The creature has never been captured, and is said to still stalk the swamps and bayous of south Arkansas, where townsfolk periodically encounter it, even today.","m_cast":"The Legend of Boggy Creek is one of several films by Charles B. Pierce, all of which are based on actual events. Pierce's films include: 1973's Walking Tall, 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1975's Macon County Line, and 1976's The Town That Dreaded Sundown and Jackson County Jail. | Pierce originally planned to call the film Tracking the Fouke Monster.[3] | Return to Boggy Creek did not involve Charles B. Pierce in any aspect, but was directed by Tom Moore. The film carries over none of the original's docudrama elements. It stars Dawn Wells of Gilligan's Island fame, and Dana Plato of Diff'rent Strokes. Wells portrays the mother of three children who become lost in the swamp until the creature comes to their rescue.[4] | A third film, originally titled The Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek, Part II, involved Pierce and was written as a sequel to the original film, thus the reason for styling the title as \"II\" instead of \"III.\" It follows the adventures of a University of Arkansas professor (Pierce) and his students, one of which is Pierce's son, on their trip to Fouke, Arkansas, to find and study the creature. A few scenes in the beginning of the movie were shot at the university, including an Arkansas Razorbacks football game.[5] The movie was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.[6] The \"Big Creature\" in the film was portrayed by James Faubus Griffith.[5] | This film's story is unrelated to the others in the franchise, shifting from Arkansas to Texas. It deals with a bigfoot-like creature attacking a group of teenagers that are vacationing in the fictional area of Boggy Creek, Texas. The film was written and directed by Brian T. Jaynes. It was originally produced in 2010 and released straight to DVD on September 13, 2011.[7] | This low-budget indie film was originally released in 2009 under the title The Skunkape Story,[8][9] but was later re-edited and released to home video in 2011 as The Legacy of Boggy Creek. The docudrama chronicles the events that began after the original attacks in Fouke. It was written and directed by Dustin Ferguson.[10] | The Legend of Boggy Creek was released theatrically to major financial success given its budget of only $160,000, earning around $20 million at the box office.[2] | According to Variety, the film earned $4.8 million in theatrical rentals in North America.[11] | It was the 10th highest grossing film of 1972.[12] Return to Boggy Creek and Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues were released to theaters later, in 1977 and 1985, respectively. Neither of the sequels were as successful as the original film. The final two films have been released straight-to-video. | Both The Legend of Boggy Creek and Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues have been released on VHS several times. Between 2002 and 2011, Hen's Tooth Video, Education 2000 Inc., Sterling Entertainment, Unicorn Video, RHR Home Video, and Cheezy Flicks Entertainment all released The Legend of Boggy Creek on Region 1 DVD.[13] Several of these versions are now out of print. The version RHR Home Video offers is the only true widescreen print available. | In 2005, Elite Entertainment released Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues on Region 1 DVD. Additionally, in 2004, the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode that lampooned the film was released on DVD by Rhino Entertainment.[14] Only the Rhino Entertainment version is still in print. Return to Boggy Creek has only been issued on VHS by CBS Home Entertainment with no plans for a DVD release as of 2011.[15] | On September 13, 2011, Boggy Creek: The Legend Is True was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Hannover House. It features a Widescreen transfer and a handful of special features.[16] Also in 2011, The Legacy of Boggy Creek was released on DVD by RHR Home Video.[17] | Its docudrama format was purposefully echoed in 1999's The Blair Witch Project.[18][19] In 2008, Duane Graves and Justin Meeks accurately recreated the drive-in feel of the movie in their blatant Boggy homage titled The Wild Man of the Navidad, released by IFC Films.[20][21][22] | ^ \"Charles B.
