{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Speed Racer is an 18-year-old whose life and love has always been automobile racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle, mechanic Sparky, and girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000, a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother's cars, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, but remains primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family. | E.P. Arnold Royalton, owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn says that he has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally. | After they drive together and work naturally as a team, Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With the help of his family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours. | Speed enters the Grand Prix against great odds: Royalton has placed a bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect, and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack \"Cannonball\" Taylor. Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor, who uses a cheating device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches it is revealed in a flashback montage that he really is Rex, who has faked his death and undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance as part of his plan to save his family and the sport of racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, and Royalton is sent to jail.","m_cast":"Emile Hirsch as Speed Racer.

Depp, without a director, also departed from the project. The studio considered director Gus Van Sant as a replacement for Temple,[12] though it would not grant writing privileges to Van Sant.[13] In December 1997, the studio briefly hired Alfonso Cuarón as director.[14] In the various incarnations of the project, screenwriters Marc Levin, Jennifer Flackett, J. J. Abrams, and Patrick Read Johnson had been hired to write scripts.[15] | In September 2000, Warner Bros. and producer Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer-director Hype Williams to take the helm of the project.[16] In October 2001, the studio hired screenwriters Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring for $1.2 million split between them to write a script for the film.[15] Eventually, without production getting under way, the director and the writers left the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded a revival of the project by presenting a take for the film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer.[11] With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project.[17] | In October 2006, directors Lana and Lilly Wachowski were brought on board by the studio to write and direct the film. Producer Joel Silver, who had collaborated with the Wachowski's for V for Vendetta and The Matrix Trilogy, explained that they were hoping to reach a broader audience with a film that would not be rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Visual effects designer John Gaeta, who won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for the Wachowskis' The Matrix, was brought in to help conceive making Speed Racer into a live-action adaptation. Production was set to begin in summer 2007 in European locations for a summer 2008 release.[19] In November 2006, the release date for it was set for May 23, 2008.[20] Producer Joel Silver described Speed Racer as a family film in line with the Wachowskis' goal to reach a wider audience.[21] | In February 2007, the Wachowskis selected Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, Germany to film.[22] In the following March, Warner Bros. moved the release date two weeks earlier to May 9, 2008.[23] The studio received a grant of $12.3 million from Germany's new Federal Film Fund, the largest yet from the organization, for its production in the Berlin-Brandenburg region.[24] The amount was later increased to $13 million.[25] Principal photography commenced on June 5, 2007 in Berlin,[21] and was shot entirely against greenscreen,[26] lasting 60 days.[5] The Wachowskis filmed in high-definition video for the first time.[27] With the camera, the Wachowskis used a layering approach that would put both the foreground and the background in focus to give it the appearance of real-life anime.[28] The film has a \"retro future\" look, according to Silver.[18] Filming concluded on August 25, 2007.[29] | In 2007, the Wachowskis purchased the rights to the sound effects and theme song of the television series for use in the film.[28] The film's soundtrack was composed by Michael Giacchino, performed by Hollywood Studio Symphony and released by Varèse Sarabande.[30][31] It was used along with orchestral score; Warner Bros. added an updated version of the \"Go, Speed Racer, Go\" theme song, which plays during the end credits, and was produced by Ali Dee Theodore and Jason Gleed, and performed by Ali Dee and the Deekompressors.[31] Razor & Tie released this version was as a extended play on January 1, 2008 to promote the film's release, and as a single released along with film's soundtrack on May 6, 2008.[31][32][33] | During its production, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) made allegations of animal cruelty against the film, reporting that one of the two chimpanzees used in the production was allegedly beaten after biting an actor.[34] The incident was confirmed by the American Humane Association (AHA) Animal Safety Representative on the set, who reported that the stand-in for the Spritle character portrayed by Litt had been bitten without provocation. The AHA representative also reported that \"toward the end of filming, during a training session in the presence of the American Humane Representative, the trainer, in an uncontrolled impulse, hit the chimpanzee.\" The AHA Film Unit referred to this abuse as \"completely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior in the use of any animal.\" The AHA has rated Speed Racer \"Unacceptable\" chiefly because of this incident, with AHA noting \"the aforementioned training incident tarnishes the excellent work of the rest of production\" and that it \"has no method of separating the actions of one individual in the employ of a production from the production as a whole.\"[35]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Speed Racer  by Tatsuo Yoshida","m_directed_by":"The Wachowski Brothers[n 1]","m_produced_by":"Joel Silver | Grant Hill | Larry Wachowski[n 1] | Andy Wachowski[n 1]","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Emile Hirsch | Christina Ricci | John Goodman | Susan Sarandon | Matthew Fox | Benno Fürmann | Hiroyuki Sanada | Rain | Richard Roundtree","m_music_by":"Michael Giacchino","m_cinematography":"David Tattersall","m_edited_by":"Roger Barton | Zach Staenberg","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

The film was written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers,[n 1] and stars Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Fox, Benno Fürmann, Hiroyuki Sanada, Rain and Richard Roundtree. The plot revolves around Speed Racer, an 18-year-old automobile racer who follows his apparently deceased brother's career. His choice to remain loyal to his family and their company Racer Motors causes difficulties after he refuses a contract offered by E.P. Arnold Royalton, the owner of Royalton Industries. | The film had been in development since 1992, changing actors, writers and directors until 2006, when producer Joel Silver and the Wachowskis collaborated to begin production on Speed Racer as a family film. Speed Racer was shot between early June and late August 2007 in and around Potsdam and Berlin, at an estimated budget of $120 million. The film score was composed by Michael Giacchino, and the film's soundtrack, which contains the sound effects and theme song from the original series, was released on May 6, 2008. | Speed Racer premiered on April 26, 2008 at the Nokia Theater, and was released in regular theaters in North America on May 9, 2008. Although it grossed over $93 million, it was considered a box office bomb due to its production cost. It was subsequently nominated in multiple categories at the Teen Choice Awards, and was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Awards. The film was criticized for its storyline, characters and dialogue but received praise for its capacity to entertain the target audience and the performance of its cast. Speed Racer also divided critics over its use of special effects. The film received mostly negative reviews by the time of its release. Years later, however, commentators called it a cult and underrated film. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Speed Racer (PG)\". British Board of Film Classification. September 5, 2008.
