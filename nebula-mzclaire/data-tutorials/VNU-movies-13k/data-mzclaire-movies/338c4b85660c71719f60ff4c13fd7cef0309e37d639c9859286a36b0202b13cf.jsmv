Following the war, the Soviets incorporated Estonia into the USSR. | A young man, Endel Nelis, arrives in Haapsalu, Estonia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the early 1950s, having left Leningrad to escape the secret police. He finds work as a teacher and founds a sports club for his students, where he starts teaching them his great passion – fencing. Disapproving, the school's principal starts investigating Endel’s background. Meanwhile, Endel's friend (and coach) Alexi warns him not to return to Leningrad under any circumstances. | Fencing becomes a form of self-expression for the children, and Endel becomes a role model and father figure. He learns to love the children, many of whom have been orphaned as a result of the Russian occupation. When the children want to participate in a national fencing tournament in Leningrad, Endel must make a choice; risk everything to take the children to Leningrad or put his safety first and disappoint them.","m_cast":"Märt Avandi – Endel | Ursula Ratasepp – Kadri | Hendrik Toompere – school principal | Liisa Koppel – Marta | Joonas Koff – Jaan | Lembit Ulfsak – Jaan's grandfather | Piret Kalda – Jaan's mother | Egert Kadastu – Toomas | Ann-Lisett Rebane – Lea | Elbe Reiter – Tiiu | Jaak Prints – assistant to the principal | Kirill Käro – Aleksei | Leida Rammo – guard in a dormitory | Raimo Pass – officer | Erkki Tikan – officer | Maria Avdjuško – an official in Leningrad | Alina Karmazina – coach from Armenia","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Klaus Härö","m_produced_by":"Kai Nordberg Kaarle Aho","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Märt Avandi Ursula Ratasepp Hendrik Toompere","m_music_by":"Gert Wilden Jr","m_cinematography":"Tuomo Hutri","m_edited_by":"Tambet Tasuja Ueli Christen","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"13 March 2015 (2015-03-13) (Estonia) | 13 March 2015 (2015-03-13) (Finland) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"98 minutes","m_country":"Finland Estonia Germany","m_language":"Estonian Russian","m_budget":"2 million euro | The Fencer (Finnish: Miekkailija, Estonian: Vehkleja)[1] is a 2015 internationally co-produced drama film adapted from the life story of Endel Nelis, an accomplished Estonian fencer and coach.[2] It was directed by Klaus Härö and written by Anna Heinämaa.
