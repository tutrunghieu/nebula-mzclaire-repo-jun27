{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Molly de Mora (Paula Marshall) invites her divorced parents (Bette Midler and Dennis Farina) to her wedding reception, where they see each other for the first time in 14 years. A shouting match between the two ensues. Following this, their spark is rekindled during the wedding reception. Over the next few days they fall in love again and run off together, thereby upsetting the newlyweds' honeymoon and their respective (current) spouses. If the scandal was made public it would be more controversial than usual, since the bride's husband hopes to stand for election to Congress. After searching for her parents and getting to know Joey Donna (Danny Nucci), her mother's number one paparazzi nicknamed \"The Cockroach\", whom she hires to help her find them, Molly decides that her parents deserve a chance to be together and gives them her honeymoon to Hawaii. When Keith objects to her decision, it is revealed that he slept with her stepmother. Knowing now that her marriage was a mistake, Molly runs off with Joey as her parents run off to Hawaii.","m_cast":"Bette Midler as Lilly Leonard | Dennis Farina as Dan de Mora | Paula Marshall as Molly de Mora | Gail O'Grady as Rowena | David Rasche as Alan | James Denton as Keith Marks | Danny Nucci as Joey Donna | Blu Mankuma as Piano Player | Jayne Eastwood as Aunt Iris | Michael J.
