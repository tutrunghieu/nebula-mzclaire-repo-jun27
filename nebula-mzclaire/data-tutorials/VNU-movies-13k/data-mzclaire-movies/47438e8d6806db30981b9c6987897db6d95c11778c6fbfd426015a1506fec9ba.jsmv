{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"At the New York Zoo, a lion named Samson tells his son Ryan stories of his adventures in the wild, but Ryan fails to unleash his roar. That night, when the zoo closes, all the animals are free to roam. Samson and his friends, a squirrel named Benny, a giraffe named Bridget, an anaconda named Larry, and a koala named Nigel compete in a turtle curling championship while Ryan goes off with his friends. During the game, Ryan accidentally scares a herd of gazelle into a stampede, which ruins the game. Samson berates Ryan for putting the animals in danger, and they have a falling-out, which ends when Ryan storms off right before Samson can apologize. Ryan wanders into a green box and gets shipped away by a truck, which the legend tells will take him to the wild. With the help of a pigeon named Hamir, Samson and Benny go after him, sneaking into a garbage disposal truck, but Nigel, Larry, and Bridget are coming along as well, accidentally throwing Benny off the truck. After passing through Times Square and nearly being crushed in the garbage disposal, the group encounters a pack of rabid stray dogs, but Samson manages to lead them to the safety of the sewers without even scaring these dogs off. There, they take directions to the docks from two street wise alligator brothers, Stan and Carmine. The next morning, the group steals a tugboat while trying to locate the box Ryan is in. With the help of Larry, they drive the boat, but end up going into the wrong direction, away from Ryan's ship. Luckily, they reunite with Benny, who has enlisted a flock of Canada geese to help lead the group to the right direction of Ryan's ship. Days later, Nigel goes mad and, under the impression they have hit an iceberg, jumps overboard. | It soon turns out that the boat has run aground in Africa, where the group quickly discovers that all the animals in the area are being evacuated by the carriers, as a nearby volcano can erupt at any moment. They soon witness Ryan escaping, but he runs deep into the jungle. Samson attempts to find him, but it is quickly revealed that he has in fact never been in the wild before after trying to eat a grumpy hyrax. The rest of the group head back to the ship, but Samson decides to keep trying to find his son. He soon starts seeing plants and rocks change colors in a mysterious way. Meanwhile, Nigel is captured by a group of wildebeests, who dwell in the volcano. There, he is pronounced and hailed as 'The Great Him' by their leader, Kazar. This was based on an 'omen' Kazar received when he was a young: about to be devoured by lions, a toy koala fell from the sky (actually from a plane) and scared the lions away, saving his life. Kazar wants to change the food chain; he would rather see \"prey become predators\" and vice versa. For this, he needs to eat a lion. Bridget and Larry are also captured and held prisoner. | Meanwhile, Ryan hides up an old tree, but is attacked by a gang of vultures led by Scraw and Scab acting under orders from Kazar. The branch breaks and traps his paw. Samson hears Ryan's cries and runs to save him, scaring off the birds. The two reunite, but are interrupted by the wildebeests who were sent by Kazar. Ryan is shocked when Samson tells him to run. The two retreat to a tree where Samson reveals the truth. He was born in the circus and like Ryan, was unable to roar. Samson's disappointed father claimed that if he had been born in the wild, he would've known how to roar before allowing him to be sent to the zoo, where he lied to avoid the shame. The wildebeests discover them and, in the scuffle, send the tree over the cliff, with Samson still hanging on. Ryan falls off, and is captured and taken to the volcano. | Benny finds Samson and encourages him to be himself, even if he's not from the wild. They soon find out why the plants and rocks are changing colors: a group of chameleons led by Cloak and Camo were leading Samson to Ryan, and revealed that Ryan is trapped inside the volcano. Not only that, they want that Samson must go there, so they can also try to defeat Kazar's army of his kind. Samson uses the chameleons' camouflage abilities to slip into Kazar's lair. Inside the volcano, Nigel tries his best to stall the wildebeests from cooking his friends, which causes Samson to eventually appear. Samson decides to fight Kazar in order to protect Ryan and his friends, but ends up getting overwhelmed. Ryan, seeing Samson in danger, climbs onto a catapulting device and launches himself at Kazar, finally letting out a roar. With Kazar distracted, Samson attacks the evil wildebeest and manages to defeat him. Impressed, Ryan tells Samson that he is happy to have him for a dad, which touces the other wildebeests so much, they refuse to serve Kazar any further. Samson manages to gain the courage he has needed and roars powerfully enough to push back a charging Kazar. The animals, along with the wildebeests flee except Kazar, who is trapped in the erupting volcano. Samson, Ryan, Benny, Nigel, Bridget, Larry, Blag, Cloak, Camo, and the other wildebeests manage to escape on the boat and travel back to the New York Zoo.","m_cast":"Kiefer Sutherland as Samson, a male lion, captain of the New York Central Park zoo and main protagonist Dominic Scott Kay as young Samson | Jim Belushi as Benny, a heroic Eastern gray squirrel and the only one who knows Samson's not from the wild | Janeane Garofalo as Bridget, an insecure masai giraffe and Benny's love interest | Greg Cipes as Ryan, a male lion cub and Samson's son | Eddie Izzard as Nigel, an eccentric British koala, co-captain of the zoo | Richard Kind as Larry, a green dim-witted anaconda snake | William Shatner as Kazar, A male blue wildebeest who is the leader of the wildebeests and the main antagonist | Patrick Warburton as Blaggar \"Blag\", Kazar's henchman and secondary antagonist | Chris Edgerly as Cloak | Bob Joles as Camo / Ringleader | Lenny Venito as Stan, A male Sewer alligator. | Joseph Siravo as Carmine, A male Sewer alligator. | Colin Cunningham as Hyrax | Colin Hay as Fergus Flamingo | Miles Marsico as Duke | Jack DeSena as Eze | Christian Argueta / David Cowgill as Hamir | Jonathan Kimmel as Scab | Eddie Gossling as Scraw | Clinton Leupp as Mama Hippo | Kevin Michael Richardson as Samson's father | Eric Idle as singing Wildebeest","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Steve \"Spaz\" Williams","m_produced_by":"Clint Goldman Beau Flynn Will Vinton (executive producer)","m_screenplay_by":"Ed Decter John J.
