{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Thomas Avery (Martin Sheen) is an American ophthalmologist who goes to France following the death of his adult son, Daniel (Emilio Estevez), killed in the Pyrenees during a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago (the Way of St. James), a Catholic pilgrimage route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. Tom's purpose is initially to retrieve his son's body. However, in a combination of grief and homage to his son, Tom decides to walk the ancient spiritual trail where his son died, taking Daniel's ashes with him. | While walking the Camino, Tom meets others from around the world, all looking for greater meaning in their lives. He reluctantly falls in with three other pilgrims in particular. Joost (Yorick van Wageningen) is an overweight man from Amsterdam who says he is walking the route to lose weight to get ready for his brother's wedding and also that his wife will desire him again. He is a friendly extrovert who is the first to start walking with Tom. Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) is a Canadian fleeing an abusive husband, who says she is walking the pilgrimage to quit smoking. Jack (James Nesbitt) is an Irish travel writer who when younger had desires to be a great author like William Butler Yeats or James Joyce but never wrote the novel he dreamed of. He is the last to join the quartet and has been suffering from \"writer's block\". As the pilgrims travel the Camino, they occasionally meet and talk with other pilgrims—two Frenchmen, a young Italian and Father Frank, an elderly priest from New York. Thomas occasionally sees visions of Daniel alive and smiling among other people. | On the pilgrimage, the group experiences challenges, such as when a young Romani steals Tom's backpack. Although the thief escapes, his father drags him back to Tom to return the pack, with embarrassed apologies and an offer to attend a street party in compensation. | After the group arrives at Santiago de Compostela, Tom is accompanied by the other three members to Muxía. He scatters the remainder of Daniel's ashes at the sea there. | With Daniel's backpack on his back, Tom sets out on another journey.","m_cast":"Martin Sheen as Thomas \"Tom\" Avery | Deborah Kara Unger as Sarah | James Nesbitt as Jack | Yorick van Wageningen as Joost | Emilio Estevez as Daniel Avery | Tchéky Karyo as Captain Henri","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was inspired by Emilio Estevez's own son, Taylor.[3] It started in 2003 as a project when Taylor, at the time 19 years old, and Sheen, whose TV series The West Wing was in hiatus, traveled the pilgrimage route. Taylor, who served as an associate producer on the film, had driven the length of the Camino with his grandfather. On the way, he met the woman who would become his wife; thus, the Camino held special meaning for him. After the trip, a series of discussions started between Sheen and his son for a movie about the Camino de Santiago.[4][5][6] Sheen originally suggested it be a low-budget documentary, but Estevez was not interested in such a small project, wanting instead a bigger experience.[6] | Estevez also found inspiration in his vineyard, Casa Dumetz, where he wrote much of the dialogue for the film.[7] | Exploring the universal themes of loss, community, and faith, he saw parallels with the characters of the film The Wizard of Oz (1939).[6] The script took six months to get a first draft.[1] | According to the opening credits, the story is also based on selected stories from Jack Hitt's book Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route into Spain (1994). | Filming started on 21 September 2009 and took 40 days. The production company and actors walked between 300 and 350 kilometers during filming. Estevez had a very small crew and shot with available light; night-time sequences were filmed by candle and firelight. Considering the Camino is special to local people on the route, the filmmakers felt great pressure to get the details right.[1] | According to a Christian Broadcasting Network interview, a key scene almost did not happen. With church leadership opposed to allowing the crew to shoot inside the famous cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, Estevez says he took a leap of faith and asked everyone on set to pray for access. \"And it worked\", claimed Sheen. The crew was given permission just 48 hours before they were scheduled to shoot the scenes, which they felt were critical to the film.[8] | Sheen originally suggested Michael Douglas or Mel Gibson for the lead role, but Estevez had written the main character's role specifically for his father.[6][9] Aside from the main actors, those seen on-screen are real pilgrims from all over the world. One episode in the film involves a group of actual Romani people from Burgos.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Emilio Estevez","m_produced_by":"David Alexanian Emilio Estevez","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Martin Sheen Deborah Kara Unger James Nesbitt Yorick van Wageningen Emilio Estevez","m_music_by":"Tyler Bates","m_cinematography":"Juan Miguel Azpiroz","m_edited_by":"Raúl Dávalos","m_production_company":"Filmax Elixir Films","m_distributed_by":"Icon Entertainment International Producers Distribution Agency (US)","m_release_dates":"September 10, 2010 (2010-09-10) (TIFF) | November 19, 2010 (2010-11-19) (Spain) | October 7, 2011 (2011-10-07) (USA) |  | ","m_running_time":"121 minutes","m_country":"United States Spain","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$4,430,765 | The Way is a 2010 American drama film directed, produced and written by Emilio Estevez, starring his father Martin Sheen, Deborah Kara Unger, James Nesbitt, Yorick van Wageningen, and Renée Estevez. | The film honors the Camino de Santiago and promotes the traditional pilgrimage.
