The film made heavy use of visual special effects that were cutting-edge at the time of its release. It follows the adventures of a half-man, half-animal individual named Harry Haller, who in the Germany of the 1920s, is depressed, resentful of his middle class station, and wants to die not knowing the world around him. He then meets two strange people who introduce him to life and a bizarre world called the Magic Theater. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Fabian, Jenny (April 21, 2000), \"Jung hearts run free\", The Guardian (London)Â .","m_external_link":"Steppenwolf at the Internet Movie Database | ","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Steppenwolf_official_release.jpg/220px-Steppenwolf_official_release.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Fred Haines Novel by Hermann Hesse"}
