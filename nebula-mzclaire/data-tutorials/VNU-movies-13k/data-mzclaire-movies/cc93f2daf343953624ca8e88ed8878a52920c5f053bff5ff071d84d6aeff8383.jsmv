{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set in Liverpool in mid-1950s. The story concerns 11-year-old Bud and his loving mother and siblings. He lives a life rich in imagination, centered on family relationships, church, and the struggles of a shy boy at school. Music and snatches of movie dialogue allow him to enrich his narrow physical environment. \"Together these fragments\", wrote Stephen Holden in the New York Times, \"evoke a postwar England starved for beauty, fantasy and a place to escape.\"[2]","m_cast":"Marjorie Yates - Mother | Leigh McCormack - Bud | Anthony Watson - Kevin | Nicholas Lamont - John | Ayse Owens - Helen | Tina Malone - Edna | Jimmy Wilde - Curly | Robin Polley - Mr. Nicholls | Peter Ivatts - Mr. Bushell | Joy Blakeman - Frances | Denise Thomas - Jean | Patricia Morrison - Amy | Gavin Mawdslay - Billy | Kirk McLaughlin - Labourer / Christ | Marcus Heath - Black Man","m_reception":"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 82% approval rating based on reviews from 11 critics, with an average rating of 7 out of 10.[6] On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 85/100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[7] | A 2009 appreciation said:[8] | Working with the most basic and most ethereal of cinematic materials — time and memory — Mr. Davies has devised a mosaiclike film language. Childhood recollections are consecrated as moments out of time and assembled into a symphonic collage, guided more by emotional logic than by plot or chronology. The working-class milieu that tends to be associated with the drab naturalism of the British kitchen-sink school, here comes swaddled in sensory delights: stately tracking shots and overhead angles, gusts of Mahler and Nat King Cole. The overall effect is one of muted rapture, a swelling ecstasy held in check by a constant tug of sadness. | Critic Armond White stated that \"If asked to name the greatest gay film ever made, I’d say, with no hesitation, The Long Day Closes.\"[9]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Terence Davies","m_produced_by":"Olivia Stewart","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Marjorie Yates Leigh McCormack Anthony Watson","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Michael Coulter","m_edited_by":"William Diver","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"22 May 1992","m_running_time":"85 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Long Day Closes is a 1992 British film directed and written by Terence Davies.
