{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story centers on Cesira (Loren), a widowed Roman shopkeeper, and Rosetta (Brown), her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, during World War II. To escape the Allied bombing of Rome, Cesira and her daughter flee southern Lazio for her native Ciociaria, a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. | After they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of a young local intellectual with communist sympathies named Michele (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. However, Michele is eventually taken prisoner by a company of German soldiers, who hope to use him as a guide to the mountainous terrain. | Cesira decides to return to Rome once the Allied troops end German occupation. On the way home, Cesira and Rosetta are gang-raped inside a church by a group of Goumier—Moroccan soldiers of the French Army. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child. When the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by German soldiers. Rosetta returns, having been out dancing with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. | Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When, however, Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. With her mother comforting the child, De Sica zooms out to end the film.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Two Women by Alberto Moravia","m_directed_by":"Vittorio De Sica","m_produced_by":"Carlo Ponti","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sophia Loren Jean-Paul Belmondo Eleonora Brown Carlo Ninchi","m_music_by":"Armando Trovajoli","m_cinematography":"Gábor Pogány","m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":"Compagnia Cinematografica Champion Cocinor Les Films Marceau Société Générale de Cinématographie (S.G.C.)","m_distributed_by":"Titanus Distribuzione","m_release_dates":"22 December 1960 (1960-12-22) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes","m_country":"Italy","m_language":"Italian German","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"2,024,049 admissions (France)[1] | Two Women (Italian: La ciociara, roughly translated as \"The [Woman] from Ciociaria\") is a 1960 Italian film directed by Vittorio De Sica.
