His method of treatment, with no violence or punishment, is met with a great deal of resistance from his unyielding and self-righteous head nurse, Lucretia Terry, who believes in traditional methods such as strait-jackets and padded cells for treating the mentally ill. | Head of the hospital Dr. Harrington is weak-willed. Terry's assistant, nurse Bracken, supports her superior's stand. After much trial and error and the harrowing near-rape of a patient, MacLeod's ideas prevail in spite of the opposition and meet some success. | Patients include a distraught mother, Lorna Medford; a former prostitute, Marion; a pyromaniac, Edna, and a former schoolteacher, Irene.","m_cast":"Opening credits | Closing credits \"We are the caretakers of their hope — their future\"","m_reception":"Variety commented, \"Miss Crawford doesn't so much play her handful of scenes as she dresses for them, looking as if she were en route to a Pepsi board meeting\", and called the film a \"superficial, ineptly-plotted drama\"[5] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times noted, \"Altogether, this woman's melodrama is shallow, showy, and cheap - a badly commercial exploitation of very sensitive material.\"[5] | Despite some negative reviews, the film went on to gross over $3 million worldwide, ranking #57 on Variety's list of top grossing films.[6]","m_production":"Co-writer/co-producer Jerry Paris also appears in The Caretakers as a passerby Lorna bumps into on the street. | Joan Crawford arranged for each day's scenes with veteran actor Herbert Marshall, an old friend who was in frail health, to be shot first, thus allowing him to finish his work early in the day.[4] | Crawford was on the board of directors of PepsiCo and Pepsi-Cola product placements include a scene at the hospital picnic, which features a wagon dispensing the soft drink.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the book by Dariel Telfer","m_directed_by":"Hall Bartlett","m_produced_by":"Hall Bartlett","m_screenplay_by":"Henry F.
