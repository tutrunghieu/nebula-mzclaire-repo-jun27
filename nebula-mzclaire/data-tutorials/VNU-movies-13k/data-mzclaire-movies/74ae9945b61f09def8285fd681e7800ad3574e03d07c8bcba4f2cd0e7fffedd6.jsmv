{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film opens with vague impressions of nature and supernatural forces before centering on a Christ-like figure telling a story to a group of bald pupils, most of whom are children. He tells a story about cosmic forces in conflict. In particular, he warns about the threat of Sateen, an evil inter-spatial force of immense magnitude. The film cuts to The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia where two fictional teams are playing a basketball game. The owner of the Atlanta team, Raymond Armstead (Lance Henriksen), sits courtside and promises an interviewer that the team will win at all costs. Since Raymond is a new owner and the source of his wealth is unknown, the interviewer presses him on the source of his wealth. He eventually answers that the money comes \"from God\". | Raymond is later seen visiting a mansion where a group of men sit at a conference table. At the head of the table, Dr. Walker (Mel Ferrer), tells Raymond that the group has invested a lot of money in Raymond. He reminds Raymond that his girlfriend, Barbara Collins (Joanne Nail), is unique among women because her womb possesses the power to transmit Sateen's cosmic force into human form. Her 8-year-old daughter Katy (Paige Connor) has already demonstrated telekinetic powers, and the committee's goal is to have Raymond father a male child with Barbara. The male child would eventually mate with his half-sister Katy and help establish the reign of Sateen. | Katy is only partially aware of her powers, and she experiments with them throughout the film. A Visitor, Jerzy Colsowicz (John Huston), is sent to Earth by the Christ-like figure, and he starts to hover around Katy. He possesses the same powers and knows that they are meant to be used for the good of mankind. He occasionally visits a rooftop in downtown Atlanta, where other bald disciples of the Christ-like figure gather in support of his mission. | A police detective, Jake Durham (Glenn Ford), investigates some of the strange and fatal occurrences that have involved Katy. For instance, Barbara ends up paralyzed by a bullet wound, and spends the rest of the movie in a wheelchair. During his investigation, unseen forces cause him to die in a car accident. | Raymond fails to seduce Barbara, and the committee decide to proceed with other, more violent methods. Barbara never has a chance to bear the intended male child because Raymond and Katy execute her by tying a wire around her neck and sending her down the stairs in her chair lift. Before they can succeed, the Visitor returns and summons an army of birds that thwart Katy and kill Raymond. The next day, all of the men that Raymond had conspired with are found dead at their round table. | In the final scene, the Visitor returns to the Christ-like figure and his bald apostles. He reveals that he has brought Katy with him. She is now bald, and the film ends with her smiling and embracing the Visitor who insists that children are not to be harmed.","m_cast":"Mel Ferrer as Dr. Walker | Glenn Ford as Det.
