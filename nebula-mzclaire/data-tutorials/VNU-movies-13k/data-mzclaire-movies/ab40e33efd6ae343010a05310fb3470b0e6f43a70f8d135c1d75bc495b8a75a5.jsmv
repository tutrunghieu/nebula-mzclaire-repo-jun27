{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Based on Hancock's childhood memories of Bournemouth, the movie is set in 1963 in the sleepy fictional seaside town of Piltdown. Hancock plays Wally Pinner, the unhappily married Punch and Judy Man. Wally and the other beach entertainers, the Sandman (John Le Mesurier) who makes sand sculptures, and Neville the photographer (Mario Fabrizi) are socially unacceptable to the town's snobbish elite. | Wally's wife, Delia (Sylvia Syms), runs a typical seaside curios shop of the time below their flat, and is socially ambitious. To achieve this she needs to have Wally invited to entertain at the official reception for Lady Jane Caterham (Barbara Murray), who is to switch on the town's illuminations, and at the Mayoress' suggestion the Reception Committee invites Wally to entertain. | The illumination ceremony ends in farce when Wally's electric shaver shorts out some of the lights, causing some of the illuminated signs to display unflattering comments about the town. The dinner degenerates into a food fight when one of the drunken guests heckles Punch, and when Lady Jane rounds on Wally, Delia floors her with a punch. Her dreams of social acceptance are gone, but Wally and Delia retire, wiser and closer.","m_cast":"Tony Hancock — Wally Pinner | Sylvia Syms — Delia Pinner | Ronald Fraser — Mayor | Barbara Murray — Lady Caterham | John Le Mesurier — The Sandman | Norman Bird — Committee Man | Kevin Brennan — Landlord | Eddie Byrne — Ice Cream Assistant | Norman Chappell — Footman | Mario Fabrizi — Nevile Shanks | Carole Ann Ford — Girl in seaside kiosk | Gerald Harper — First Drunk | Walter Hudd — Clergyman | Hattie Jacques — Dolly Zarathusa, the Fortune Teller | Hugh Lloyd — Edward Cox | Michael Ripper — Waiter | Peter Vaughan — Committee Man | Russell Waters — Bobby Bachelor","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jeremy Summers","m_produced_by":"Gordon Scott (as Gordon L.
