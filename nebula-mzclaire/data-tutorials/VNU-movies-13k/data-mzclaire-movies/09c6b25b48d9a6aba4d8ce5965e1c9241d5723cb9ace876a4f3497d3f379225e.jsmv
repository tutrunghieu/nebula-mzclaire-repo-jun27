The continued rebroadcasts and accompanying DVD releases have served to re-animate the controversy over the Arrow's cancellation and introduce the story to a new generation.[5]","m_production":"Although the miniseries is based on history, it is a work of fiction, employing composite characters, and depicting some events that actually did not take place. It acknowledges that there is no hard evidence to support the fictional final scenes, depicting one Arrow that escaped the torches used to tear the other Arrows apart, in accord with allegations attributed to reporter June Callwood. There are errors in illustrations, such as the wing design (the classified design does not appear on the models used, other than on one model the morning after Jim Chamberlin made his modifications); during the \"destruct and dispose\" operation, an Apollo lunar module is shown in its final configuration, although that design was arrived at by Grumman Aircraft in the later 1960s out of sheer necessity to reduce weight. | Wetaskiwin resident Allan Jackson's efforts to build a full-scale model of the Arrow were discovered during the research phase of pre-production. An offer was made to complete the model and use it in the miniseries. A CBC crew of model makers and set designers completed the full-scale model in time for principal photography that took place in Winnipeg. The production eventually used a combination of archival film, remote-control flying models and computer animation for the static, ground and flying sequences. | The full-scale Arrow model differs slightly from those built in 1957-59. It was featured throughout the film but the wing structure had a pronounced outer panel dihedral that was \"corrected\" by CGI work. The wing design was seen on-screen \"only\" on a wind tunnel model crafted after an \"all-nighter\" by Chamberlin that was stable at Mach 2.5 and higher. | At the end of film production, Jackson's model was returned but had to be cut into sections in order to fit on the flat-bed trucks used to transport the model to Alberta. After arriving at the Reynolds Alberta Museum in Wetaskawin, Jackson and a team of volunteers reconstructed the model for display at the Abbotsford Air Show in 1997. A wind gust damaged the tail of the model in 1999 leading to its removal from an outside display area of the museum to be repaired indoors at the museum storage facility. Students and instructors from Edmonton's NAIT's Aircraft Structures program have volunteered close to 400 hours restoring the full-scale model to be displayed at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in 2009 as part of celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of powered flight in Canada and the 50th anniversary of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. The restored model remains in storage in 2010 and is not accessible to the public.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Don McBrearty","m_produced_by":"Aaron Kim Johnston | Eric Jordan | Paul Stephens | Mary Young Leckie","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dan Aykroyd | Sara Botsford | Michael Ironside","m_music_by":"Christopher Dedrick","m_cinematography":"Rene Ohashi","m_edited_by":"Ralph Brunjes","m_production_company":"The Film Works Tapestry Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Morningstar Entertainment","m_release_dates":"12 January 1997 (1997-01-12) (Canada) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"180 min.","m_country":"Canada","m_language":"English | The Arrow is a four-hour miniseries produced for CBC Television in 1996, starring Dan Aykroyd as Crawford Gordon, experienced wartime production leader during World War II and president of A.
