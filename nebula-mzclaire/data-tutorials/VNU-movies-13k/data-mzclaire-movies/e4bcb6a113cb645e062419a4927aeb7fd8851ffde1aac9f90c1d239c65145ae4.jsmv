{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Abby McClure (Doris Day) is a widow with three sons who runs the lumberyard her husband owned. Her matchmaking sister Maxine (Pat Carroll) tricks her into calling widower Jake Iverson (Brian Keith) and inviting him to the business dinner party Abby is having later that night. Not interested in the trouble his sexy, adultery-minded neighbor Cleo (Elaine Devry) is trying to get him into, Jake arrives at Abby's, only to be bored by all of the matchmaking dialogue. Jake makes up an excuse to leave, but later runs into Abby at an all-night supermarket. Embarrassed by being caught in a fib, Jake meets Abby at a local drive-in run by the wise-cracking Herbie (George Carlin) and the two stay out until 2 a.m. A romance develops, much to the chagrin of Jake's teenage daughter, Stacey (Barbara Hershey); and Abby's three sons, Flip, Mitch and Jason (John Findlater, Jimmy Bracken, and Richard Steele). The children make certain that neither Jake nor Abby can be comfortable at the other's home, so the pair wind up more than once at the drive-in, before finally falling in love. Getting fed up with the situation, they elope, not telling their children that they have married until the next day after being discovered in bed together. | Although now married, Abby's sons fight with Iverson's possessive daughter Stacey, while Flip and Stacey both are hostile to the idea of a step-parent. Even Abby's sheepdog and Jake's poodle are incompatible. Neither of their homes are large enough for the family of six—which doesn't include Abby's live-in maid Molly (Alice Ghostley), and while they move into Abby's house and eventually put Jake's up for sale, the newlyweds borrow a camper, which they use as a bedroom. | The morning after a bedtime argument, Abby drives off in a rage in the camper, with Jake falling out in the process, clad only in boxers and clutching a teddy bear. After running through the neighborhood, he enlists Herbie to give him some clothing and a ride back to his house. Once Abby discovers what has happened, she returns only to find Jake gone. She is joined by a band of hippies she meets when she shows up at the drive-in. When the camper collides with a livestock truck carrying chickens, Abby and the hippies are arrested. Hearing of the accident, Jake and the children rush to her rescue, colliding with the same chicken truck. The angry driver assaults Jake, and the children (and the pets) unite in his defense. At the station house parents and children are joyfully reconciled, and the family finally buys a huge two-story house big enough for a family of six, a maid, and two dogs. | The title of the movie comes from a scene where the family goes out for Chinese food, and one of the kids notices that because they are a large group, they get something extra. \"Hey! With six you get eggroll!\"","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"It was the first film made by the newly-formed Cinema Center Films, a subdivision of CBS network.[2] | The cast includes several actors in small parts—some who go uncredited—who are much better known for other performances, such as Jamie Farr, William Christopher, Ken Osmond, Allan Melvin, Jackie Joseph, Milton Frome, Vic Tayback, Peter Leeds, Howard Morris, Maudie Prickett. and Creed Bratton. | The film was released only four months after United Artists' Yours, Mine and Ours. While both films have the same premise—that of a widow and a widower marrying each other and creating a blended family—the United Artists film was based on a true story and was a huge commercial success (if not critical) becoming the 11th highest grossing film of the year. | Although there are similarities between this film, Yours, Mine and Ours and the later ABC television show The Brady Bunch that premiered in 1969, the original pilot script for The Brady Bunch predated the scripts for both of these films.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Howard Morris","m_produced_by":"Martin Melcher","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Doris Day Brian Keith","m_music_by":"Robert Mersey","m_cinematography":"Ellsworth Fredericks Harry Stradling Jr.","m_edited_by":"Adrienne Fazan","m_production_company":"Cinema Center Films Arwin Productions","m_distributed_by":"National General Pictures (1968, original) Paramount Pictures (2005, DVD)","m_release_dates":"August 7, 1968 (1968-08-07) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"95 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$10,095,200[1] | With Six You Get Eggroll is a 1968 American romantic comedy film directed by Howard Morris, and stars Doris Day, Brian Keith, Barbara Hershey, George Carlin (in his film debut) and Pat Carroll.
