{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set two years after the events of the Fourth Shinobi World War. | Kakashi Hatake became the Sixth Hokage, and the moon begins to descend towards Earth, with the moon now becoming a meteor that would destroy everything on impact. The crisis is caused by Toneri Ōtsutsuki, a descendant of Hamura Ōtsutsuki through the Branch House, determined to fulfill his ancestor's legacy that mankind must be punished for using chakra as weapon hostilities for over a millennia. | During the Rinne Festival, Hinata Hyuga hopes to give Naruto Uzumaki a personal gift of love - a red scarf - she knitted herself in remembrance of one Naruto used to wear back in the Academy, and Sakura Haruno offers to help. However, she is unable to because Naruto is receiving various gifts, including another scarf, for his hero reputation. Toneri infiltrates Konoha then kidnaps Hinata's sister, Hanabi Hyuga, but fails to seize Hinata due to Naruto's intervention. The scarf she made gets torn in the fight. Deployed for a mission to rescue Hanabi, Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Sai, and Shikamaru Nara prepare to set out. Shikamaru is given a special clock by Kakashi that serves as a countdown to the Earth's destruction if the moon continues to fall. On the journey through the abandoned Shinobi village of the Ōtsutsuki Clan, Naruto gradually begins to realize the concept of love from experiencing Hinata's memories while caught in a genjutsu and from spending more time with her one on one. At some point, Toneri transplants Hanabi's eyes into himself to awaken the Tenseigan that was sealed by his ancestors over the last millennium. He also succeeds in proposing to Hinata to marry him; she \"accepts\" his offer, which causes Naruto to fall into deep depression after being thoroughly beaten by Toneri and rejected by Hinata. At the same time, the hidden villages defend themselves against the meteorites breaking off from the moon as they evacuate civilians all over from Toneri's genocidal assault. In Naruto's absence, Sasuke Uchiha returns to protect Konoha. | After a three-day recovery process, Naruto wakes up and sees Sakura severely weakened due to saving his life, and helps him realize that no matter what happened, Hinata truly loves him. With new-found strength, Naruto leads the charge into Toneri's moon base. There, Toneri asks Hinata to knit a red scarf for him. But in reality, Hinata only accepted Toneri's proposal as she was contained by the spirit of Hamura to aid him as the \"Byakugan Princess\" to destroy the Tenseigan altar because Toneri had misinterpreted Hamura's decree. But Toneri realized the deception and brainwashes Hinata while destroying the scarf she had originally made for Naruto. Naruto's team finally catches up and a massive attack on Toneri's palace begins. The team splits, with Naruto rescuing Hinata from the ceremony, while the others secure Hanabi. However, Toneri's Tenseigan chakra cloak grants him the power to slice the moon in half, placing Hinata in a giant bird cage. Naruto enters Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, and a huge duel ensues. Near the end, Naruto grasps the last remaining shred of the scarf and channels his chakra and delivers a punch strong enough to pin Toneri against the wall and depower him, stopping the moon from falling. Hinata also takes Hanabi's eyes from Toneri and returns them back to her sister. Toneri then discovers the truth about Hamura's decree. Learning the error of his ways, Toneri decides to stay on the moon to atone his sins as it returns to orbit. Naruto reveals to Hinata that the scarf he had earlier was his late mother's, then he confesses his love for Hinata and the two kiss. | During the end credits, scenes show Naruto and Hinata's wedding, attended by their friends and family. In a post-credits scene, set during the time of the series' epilogue, the couple play with their children: Boruto and Himawari.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Amy McNulty of Anime News Network, while criticizing the unengaging villain, overarching plot and score for having no impact, praised the top-notch animation and story for taking a more character-driven romance approach to it than previous films, concluding that \"Despite the (awkward) title, the movie is not actually the final film in the franchise, but it's the last of an era and a fitting capstone for the series and its fandom.\"[16] Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, saying that \"If 'The Last' lacks some of the emotional punch of the previous feature, 'The Road to Ninja,' Kobayashi compensates with flamboyant visuals that mix CG, drawn animation and elegant calligraphic figures, fans should stay through the credits for a surprising final scene.\"[17] | During its first weekend, The Last earned ¥515 million (US$4.35 million).[18] The film has grossed ¥1.29 billion after three weekends.[19] And by the end of December 2014, it had earned about ¥1.75 billion (US$14.76 million) and became the top-grossing feature film in the franchise.[4]","m_production":"The film is directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi[5] while manga author Masashi Kishimoto is providing the story concept, character designs, and exercising complete editorial supervision.[6] The film was first announced at Jump Festa 2012.[7][8] It was premiered on December 6, 2014, which made it the first movie in the franchise to be released two years after the previous film.[6] Its first teaser was revealed on July 31, 2014.[9] | The film was heavily promoted in the lead up to the Naruto manga finale in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, with new concept designs and information revealed on a weekly basis.[10][11] A new character voiced by Jun Fukuyama made an appearance in the movie.
