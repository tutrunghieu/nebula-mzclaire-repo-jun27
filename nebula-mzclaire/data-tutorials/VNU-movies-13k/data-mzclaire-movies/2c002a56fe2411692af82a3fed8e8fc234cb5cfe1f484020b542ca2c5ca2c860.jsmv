{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"During the American Civil War, mercenary Angel Eyes interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens about Bill Carson, a fugitive who stole a cache of Confederate gold. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the contract, and kills Stevens as he leaves. Angel Eyes returns to Baker for his fee, then shoots Baker, fulfilling his contract with Stevens. | Meanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez is rescued from three bounty hunters by \"Blondie\", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie shoots Tuco's noose and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. As Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, he abandons him penniless in the desert. | Tuco survives and tracks Blondie to a town being abandoned by Confederate troops. As he prepares to kill Blondie, Union forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape. Following an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a desert until Blondie collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside is a delirious Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. When Tuco returns with water, Carson is dead and Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that he knows the name on the grave. | Tuco and Blondie travel to a frontier mission, disguising themselves as Confederate soldiers. After Blondie's recovery, the two leave in their Confederate uniforms, only to be captured by Union soldiers and remanded to the POW camp of Batterville. At roll call, Tuco answers for \"Bill Carson,\" getting the attention of Angel Eyes, now a disguised Union sergeant at the camp. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Realizing that Blondie will not yield to torture, Angel Eyes offers him an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes. | Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town. Tuco, having fled to the same town, takes a bath in a ramshackle hotel and is surprised by Elam, a bounty hunter searching for him. Tuco shoots Elam. Blondie investigates the gunshots and finds Tuco, and they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but discover that Angel Eyes himself has escaped. | Tuco and Blondie travel to Sad Hill, now held by Confederate troops on one side of a strategic bridge against the advancing Union troops. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies to allow access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie reveals the name on the grave as \"Arch Stanton.\" After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse, and Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. He finds Arch Stanton's grave and begins digging. Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. A moment later, Angel Eyes surprises them both, also at gunpoint. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing just a skeleton. Blondie writes the real name of the grave on a rock and, placing it facedown in an area full of similar rocks, silently challenges Tuco and Angel Eyes to a three-way duel. | The trio stare each other down. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie directs him to a grave beside Arch Stanton's marked \"Unknown.\" Inside are bags of gold. Tuco is initially elated, until Blondie orders him into a hangman's noose beneath a tree. Blondie binds Tuco's hands and forces him atop an unsteady grave marker, takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams at him, Blondie returns into sight. Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco, alive and angry, onto his share of the gold, before riding off into the horizon.","m_cast":"Clint Eastwood as \"Blondie\" (a.k.a. the Man with No Name): The Good, a subdued, cocksure bounty hunter who teams with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an ambivalent partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. \"I've never seen so many men wasted so badly,\" he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. | Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for (which is usually finding—and killing—people). When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. | Eli Wallach as Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez (known as \"The Rat\" according to Blondie): The Ugly, a comical, oafish (though very dangerous, cagey and resilient), fast-talking Mexican bandit who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave—only Blondie does. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. | Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton. A drunken Union officer who befriends Tuco and Blondie. He feels that the bloody confrontation his men are involved in is a futile waste, and dreams of destroying Branston Bridge—a wish carried out by Blondie and Tuco. Mortally wounded in the ensuing battle, he dies smiling just after hearing the bridge's destruction. | Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace. A thuggish prison guard who works for Angel Eyes and brutally tortures Tuco to get him to reveal the hidden location of the treasure. Angel Eyes turns Tuco over to Wallace so that he can turn Tuco in for the reward money. Tuco, however, kills Wallace and escapes. | Luigi Pistilli as Father Pablo Ramírez. Tuco's brother, a Catholic friar. He holds Tuco in contempt for his choice of life as a bandit, but ultimately loves him. | Al Mulock as Elam, the one-armed bounty hunter. Wounded by Tuco in the film's opening scene, he loses his right arm. He seeks revenge, only to be shot and killed by Tuco, who then proclaims: \"When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk.\" | Antonio Casas as Stevens. Killed by Angel Eyes, who was paid to carry out the killing by Baker. | Antonio Casale as Bill Carson/Jackson. | Sergio Mendizábal as blond bounty hunter. One of three bounty hunters killed by Blondie during an attempted arrest of Tuco. | John Bartha as Sheriff. Takes custody of Tuco. Hat shot off by Blondie. | Claudio Scarchilli as Pedro, a member of Tuco's gang. Killed by Blondie. | Sandro Scarchilli as Chico, a member of Tuco's gang. Killed by Blondie. | Antonio Molino Rojo as Captain Harper, the good captain at the Union prison camp who is slowly losing a leg to gangrene. Harper warns Angel Eyes not to be dishonest on his watch, but Angel Eyes holds him in contempt and deliberately ignores his orders. | Benito Stefanelli as Angel Eyes gang member. Henchman killed by Tuco. | Aldo Sambrell as Angel Eyes gang member. Henchman killed by Blondie. | Lorenzo Robledo as Clem, henchman sent to follow Blondie when he leaves Angel Eyes' hideout, after Tuco kills the bounty hunter. Blondie discovers him and shoots him in the stomach. | Enzo Petito as Mr. Milton, the guileless store keeper robbed by Tuco. | Livio Lorenzon as Baker, the Confederate soldier involved in the money scheme with Stevens and Carson. Killed by Angel Eyes, who was paid to carry out the killing by Stevens. | Rada Rassimov as María, a prostitute who is beaten by Angel Eyes for information about Bill Carson. | Chelo Alonso (uncredited) as Stevens' wife.","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the last film in the Dollars Trilogy, and thus does not have an official sequel. Following the film's release, Leone went on to direct two more Westerns (Once Upon a Time in the West and Duck, You Sucker!) and was involved in the production of other Spaghetti Westerns (My Name is Nobody and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe), but none of these bore direct relations with his previous films. | However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2 (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2). According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in taking part in the film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.[67]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Sergio Leone","m_produced_by":"Alberto Grimaldi","m_screenplay_by":"Age & Scarpelli Luciano Vincenzoni Sergio Leone Sergio Donati (uncredited) English Version: Mickey Knox","m_story_by":"Luciano Vincenzoni Sergio Leone","m_starring":"Clint Eastwood Lee Van Cleef Aldo Giuffrè Mario Brega Eli Wallach","m_music_by":"Ennio Morricone","m_cinematography":"Tonino Delli Colli","m_edited_by":"Eugenio Alabiso Nino Baragli","m_production_company":"Produzioni Europee Associati (PEA) Arturo González Producciones Cinematográficas Constantin Film United Artists","m_distributed_by":"PEA (Italy) United Artists (US & UK)","m_release_dates":"15 December 1966 (1966-12-15) (Italy) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"161 minutes","m_country":"Italy West Germany Spain","m_language":"Italian English","m_budget":"$1.2 million[2]","m_box_office":"$25.1 million[3] | The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Italian title: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. \"The Good, the Ugly, the Bad\") is a 1966 Italian epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in the title roles respectively.[4] The screenplay was written by Age & Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Leone (with additional screenplay material provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati),[5] based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli was responsible for the film's sweeping widescreen cinematography and Ennio Morricone composed the film's score, including its main theme. It was a co-production between companies in Italy, Spain, West Germany, and the United States. | The film is known for Leone's use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of violence, tension, and stylistic gunfights. The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way.[6] The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef. | The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was marketed as the third and final installment in the Dollars Trilogy, following A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office. Because of general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now seen as a highly influential example of the Western film genre and one of the greatest films of all time. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ A Fistful of Dollars (The Christopher Frayling Archives: A Fistful of Dollars) (Blu-ray).
