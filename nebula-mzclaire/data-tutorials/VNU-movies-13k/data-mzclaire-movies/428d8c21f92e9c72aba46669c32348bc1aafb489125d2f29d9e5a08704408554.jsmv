{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"As a leader of the local community, Chairman Amin (Shahir Huda Rumi) bans every kind of image in his water-locked village in rural Bangladesh. He even goes on to claim that imagination is also sinful since it gives one the license to infiltrate into any prohibited territory. But change is a desperate wind that is difficult to resist by shutting the window. The tension between this traditional window and modern wind grows to such an extent that it starts to leave a ripple effect on the lives of a group of typically colorful, eccentric, and emotional people living in that village. But at the very end of the film, Television, which he hated so much, comes to the rescue and helps Chairman Amin reach a transcendental state where he and his God are unified. A new twist to the story makes him embrace IMAGE and IMAGINATION.","m_cast":"Shahir Huda Rumi | Chanchal Chowdhury | Mosharraf Karim | Nusrat Imrose Tisha","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mostofa Sarwar Farooki","m_produced_by":"Chabial.
