During one such outing one of the waitresses made it clear through her attitude that she didn't approve of Baker, who is white, being friends with Ingram who is black. To get back at her, Ingram would pop his eyes from their sockets when she passed their table, frightening her and when she tried to point it out to other waitresses and patrons he would then relocate his eyes back in their sockets and then he and Baker would pretend nothing happened. According to the film's producer and co-writer Robert D. Weinbach, the role for Professor Nolter was originally intended for famed horror actor Vincent Price, however due to difficulties with Price's agent the idea was abandoned.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jack Cardiff","m_produced_by":"Robert D.
