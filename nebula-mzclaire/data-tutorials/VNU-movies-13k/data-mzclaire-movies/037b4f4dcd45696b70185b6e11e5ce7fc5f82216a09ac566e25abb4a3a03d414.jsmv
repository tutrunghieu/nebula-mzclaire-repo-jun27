{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1910, the last year of Leo Tolstoy's life, his disciples, led by Vladimir Chertkov, manoeuvre against his wife, Sofya, for control over Tolstoy's works after his death. The main setting is the Tolstoy country estate of Yasnaya Polyana. Tolstoy and Sofya have had a long, passionate marriage, but his spiritual ideals and asceticism (he is opposed, for example, to private property) are at odds with her more aristocratic and conventionally religious views. | Contention focuses on a new will that the \"Tolstoians\" are attempting to persuade him to sign. It would place all of his copyrights into the public domain, supposedly leaving his family without adequate support. The maneuvering is seen through the eyes of Tolstoy's new secretary, Valentin Bulgakov, who finds himself mediating between the two sides. He also has a love affair with one of the Tolstoians, Masha. | Ultimately, Tolstoy signs the new will and travels to an undisclosed location where he can continue his work undisturbed. After his departure, Sofya unsuccessfully attempts suicide. During the journey, Tolstoy falls ill. The film ends with his death near the Astapovo train station where Sofya is allowed by their daughter to see him just moments before his death.[3] The closing credits state that five years after his death the Russian senate reverted the copyrights of Tolstoy's work to Sofya.","m_cast":"Christopher Plummer as Leo Tolstoy[3] | Helen Mirren as Sofya, Leo's wife. | Paul Giamatti as Vladimir Chertkov, the leader of Tolstoy's devoted disciples. | James McAvoy as Valentin Fedorovich Bulgakov, a private secretary. | Kerry Condon as Masha, a fictional member of the Tolstoyans. | Anne-Marie Duff as Sasha, Leo and Sofia's daughter. | Patrick Kennedy as Sergeyenko | John Sessions as Dr. Dušan Makovický, a Slovak, Leo's personal doctor.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Filming took place in the German federal states of Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg (Studio Babelsberg) and Thuringia, the city of Leipzig in Saxony and at historical locations in Russia.[3] The location for Jasnaja Poljana, the residence of the Tolstoy family, was the Schloss Stülpe palace near Luckenwalde in Brandenburg.
