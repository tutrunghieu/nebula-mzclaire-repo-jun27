{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Travis Bickle, an honorably discharged U.S. Marine, is a lonely, depressed young man living on his own in New York City. He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom. | Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent, but Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path. Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and attempts to find an outlet for his frustrations by beginning a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers Travis to illegal gun dealer Easy Andy, from whom he buys a number of handguns. At home, Travis practices drawing his weapons and constructs a sleeve gun to hide and then quickly deploy a gun from his sleeve. One night, Travis enters a convenience store moments before an attempted armed robbery and he shoots and kills the robber. The shop owner takes responsibility for the shooting, taking Travis' handgun. On another night, teenage prostitute Iris enters Travis's cab, attempting to escape her pimp Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins. Sport drags Iris from the cab and throws Travis a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, which continually reminds him of her and the corruption that surrounds him. Some time later, Travis hires Iris, but instead of having sex with her, attempts to dissuade her from continuing in prostitution. He fails to completely turn her from her course, but she does agree to meet with him for breakfast the next day. Travis leaves a letter to Iris at his apartment saying he will soon be dead, with money for her to return home. The letter is intercepted by Sport, who gives the money to a gangster who comes to have sex with Iris. | After shaving his head into a mohawk, Travis attends a public rally, where he plans to assassinate Senator Palantine, but Secret Service agents notice him with his hand in his coat and chase him. He flees and later goes to the East Village to invade Sport's brothel. A violent gunfight ensues and Travis kills Sport, a bouncer, and a mafioso. Travis is severely injured with multiple gunshot wounds. Iris witnesses the fight and is hysterical with fear, pleading with Travis to stop the killing. After the gunfight, Travis attempts suicide, but has run out of ammunition and resigns himself to lying on a sofa until police arrive. When they do, he places his index finger against his temple gesturing the act of shooting himself. | Travis, after having recovered from his wounds and returning to work, receives a letter from Iris' father thanking him for saving her life and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh, where she is going to school. Later, he reconciles with Betsy after dropping her off at home in his cab. When she tries to pay her fare, Travis simply smiles at her and drives away. In the final shot, Travis looks in the rearview mirror and suddenly becomes agitated.","m_cast":"Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle | Jodie Foster as Iris | Harvey Keitel as Sport | Cybill Shepherd as Betsy | Albert Brooks as Tom | Leonard Harris as Charles Palantine | Peter Boyle as Wizard | Harry Northup as Doughboy | Norman Matlock as Charlie T | Martin Scorsese as Passenger Watching Silhouette | Victor Argo as Melio | Steven Prince as Andy - Gun Salesman | Joe Spinell as Personnel Officer | Diahnne Abbott as Concession Girl | Bob Maroff as Mafioso","m_reception":"Filmed on a budget of $1.3 million, Taxi Driver was a financial success, grossing $28,262,574 in the United States,[35] making it the 17th-highest-grossing film of 1976. | Roger Ebert instantly praised it as one of the greatest films he had ever seen, claiming: | Taxi Driver is a hell, from the opening shot of a cab emerging from stygian clouds of steam to the climactic killing scene in which the camera finally looks straight down. Scorsese wanted to look away from Travis's rejection; we almost want to look away from his life. But he's there, all right, and he's suffering.[36] | It was also nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (De Niro), and received the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.[37] It has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.[38] The film was chosen by Time as one of the 100 best films of all time.[39] | Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 99% based on reviews from 68 critics; the site's consensus states: \"A must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.\"[40] Metacritic gives the film a score of 93 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[41] | The July/August 2009 issue of Film Comment polled several critics on the best films to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Taxi Driver placed first, above films such as Il Gattopardo, Viridiana, Blowup, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, La Dolce Vita, and Pulp Fiction.[42] | In the American Film Institute's top 50 movie villains of all time, Bickle was named the 30th greatest film villain. Empire also ranked him 18th in its \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll.[43] | Time Out magazine conducted a poll of the 100 greatest movies set in New York City. Taxi Driver topped the list placing at No. 1.[44] | ","m_production":"According to Scorsese, it was Brian De Palma who introduced him to Schrader. In Scorsese on Scorsese, the director talks about how much of the film arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He admits attempting to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state somewhere between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man and Jack Hazan's A Bigger Splash as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.[12] | In Scorsese on Scorsese, the director mentions the religious symbolism in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the samurai's \"death with honour\" principle.[12] | When Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in Kris Kristofferson's song \"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\": \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fictionâ€”a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which is in fact the American sexplotation film Sexual Freedom in Denmark with added Swedish sound.[13] | Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike, Taxi Driver came into conflict with the MPAA for its violence (Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shoot-out, and the film got an R rating). To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's cab, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. | In writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of Arthur Bremer (who shot presidential candidate George Wallace in 1972)[14] and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground. The writer also used himself as inspiration; prior to writing the screenplay, Schrader was in a lonely and alienated position, much like Bickle is. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. He wrote the script in under a month while staying in his former girlfriend's apartment while she was away. | Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the national trauma of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening. Thus, Bickle chooses to drive his taxi anywhere in the city as a way to feed his hate.[15] | While preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a cab driver's license, and when on break would pick up a cab and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming 1900. De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of Arthur Bremer. When he had time off from shooting 1900, De Niro visited an army base in Northern Italy and tape-recorded soldiers from the Midwestern United States, whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character. | When Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a Mohawk. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted, \"Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... and you knew that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... we thought it was a good idea.\" | Jodie Foster was not the first choice to play Iris. Scorsese considered Melanie Griffith, Linda Blair, Bo Derek, and Carrie Fisher for the role. A newcomer, Mariel Hemingway, auditioned for the role but turned it down due to pressure from her family. After the other actresses turned down the role as well, Foster, an experienced child actor, was chosen. | In the original draft, Schrader had written the role of Sport as a black man. There were also additions of other negative black roles. Scorsese believed that this would give the film an overly racist subtext, so they were changed to white roles. The Terminal Bar was featured in a scene in the film.[16] | Schrader originally set the film in Los Angeles, but it was moved to New York City because taxicabs were much more prevalent there than in Los Angeles.[citation needed] | Taking place in an actual apartment, the tracking shot over the murder scene at the end took three months of preparation just because the production team had to cut through the ceiling in order to get it right.[17]","m_sequel":"In late January 2005, a sequel was announced by De Niro and Scorsese.[58] At a 25th-anniversary screening of Raging Bull, De Niro talked about the story of an older Travis Bickle being in development. Also in 2000, De Niro mentioned interest in bringing back the character in conversation with Actors Studio host James Lipton.[59] In November 2013, he revealed that Schrader had done a first draft but both he and Scorsese thought that it was not good enough to go beyond.[60] | At the Berlinale 2010, De Niro, Scorsese, and Lars von Trier announced plans to work on a remake of Taxi Driver. The film would be produced in a similar manner to von Trier's The Five Obstructions.[61] | In December 2011, Scorsese was interviewed about combining his passion for 3D as a new medium with the legacy of older films, and said, \"If I could go back in time, I'd shoot Taxi Driver in 3D. Robert De Niro in the mirror as Travis Bickle. Imagine how intimidating. 'You talking to me? You talking to me?' Amazing possibilities.\"[62][63]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Martin Scorsese","m_produced_by":"Julia Phillips | Michael Phillips","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Robert De Niro | Jodie Foster | Albert Brooks | Harvey Keitel | Leonard Harris | Peter Boyle | Cybill Shepherd","m_music_by":"Bernard Herrmann","m_cinematography":"Michael Chapman","m_edited_by":"Tom Rolf | Melvin Shapiro | Marcia Lucas (sup)","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"FebruaryÂ 8,Â 1976Â (1976-02-08) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"113 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$1.3 million","m_box_office":"$28.3 million[1] | Taxi Driver is a 1976 American vigilante film[2][3][4] with neo-noir[5][6][7] and psychological thriller[5][8][9][10] elements, directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader.

The film also ranks #17 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[11] In 2012, Sight & Sound named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, ranked with The Godfather Part II, and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. The film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1994. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Taxi Driver (1976)\".
