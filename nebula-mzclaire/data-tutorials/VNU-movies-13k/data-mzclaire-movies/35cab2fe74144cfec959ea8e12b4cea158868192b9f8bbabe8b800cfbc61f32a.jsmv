{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Kansas (Hopper) is a stunt coordinator in charge of horses on a western being shot in a small Peruvian village. Following a tragic incident on the set where an actor is killed in a stunt, Kansas decides to quit the movie business and stay in Peru with a local woman. Kansas thinks he has found paradise, but is soon called in to help in a bizarre incident: the Peruvian natives are \"filming\" their own movie with \"cameras\" made of sticks, and acting out real western movie violence, as they don't understand movie fakery. The film touches on the ideas of fiction versus reality, especially in regards to cinema. The movie is presented in a way that challenges the viewer's traditional cinematic understanding of storytelling, by presenting the story in a non-chronological fashion, and by including several devices typically only seen behind the scenes of filmmaking (rough edits and \"scene missing\" cards), and the use of jarring jump cuts.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The movie won the Critics Prize at the Venice Film Festival; despite this, it failed financially and critically after a two-week run at New York City's Cinema 1.[2] (Contrary to some sources, including statements by Hopper himself, the film did play in other theaters across the country after its New York premiere, even playing at drive-ins under the name Chinchero.) Because of its resulting demise, Hopper did not direct again until 1980's Out of the Blue. | The book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time recounts the film's production in some detail, claiming that the studio was so eager to cash in on the youth market following the success of Easy Rider that they gave Hopper carte blanche, and they were horrified with the results.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Dennis Hopper","m_produced_by":"Paul Lewis, Bob Rafelson, Michael Gruskoff (executive)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dennis Hopper Stella Garcia Julie Adams Sylvia Miles Peter Fonda Henry Jaglom Michelle Phillips Kris Kristofferson Tomas Milian | Dennis Hopper Stella Garcia Julie Adams Sylvia Miles Peter Fonda Henry Jaglom Michelle Phillips Kris Kristofferson","m_music_by":"Severn Darden, Chabuca Granda, Kris Kristofferson, John Buck Wilkin","m_cinematography":"László Kovács","m_edited_by":"Dennis Hopper, David Berlatsky, Antranig Mahakian","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"September 28, 1971 (1971-09-28) (New York City) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"108 min","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$1 million | The Last Movie is a 1971 drama film from Universal Pictures.
