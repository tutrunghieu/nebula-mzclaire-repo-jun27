Although Tammy Grimes had originated the title role and had won the Tony Award for Best Actress for her performance, MGM executives wanted Shirley MacLaine for the film. After she signed, producer Hal Wallis claimed she was under contract to him, and MacLaine was forced to withdraw from the project. When Debbie Reynolds was cast instead, MacLaine publicly accused her of agreeing to accept a lower salary in order to land the role, and director Charles Walters, who preferred MacLaine, tried to persuade Reynolds to turn down the part.[2] | Exteriors were filmed in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in western Colorado. | Only five of the seventeen musical numbers from the stage musical were used in the film, and Meredith Willson wrote \"He's My Friend\" to extend the song score.[3] Peter Gennaro, who had choreographed the original Broadway production, staged the musical sequences. | During production, M-G-M was putting all its resources into its forthcoming Doctor Zhivago (1965), and at least $1 million was cut from the budget of Molly Brown. Running out of money to complete the film, director Charles Walters proposed cutting the rousing dance number \"He's My Friend\". To save the number, cast and crew ultimately decided to film it in one rigorous day using multiple cameras to reduce shooting time.[4] | The film was the 12th largest grossing attraction of 1964, grossing $11,070,559 at the domestic box office.[1] It earned $7.5 million in US theatrical rentals.[5][6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Charles Walters","m_produced_by":"Lawrence Weingarten","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Debbie Reynolds Harve Presnell Ed Begley","m_music_by":"Meredith Willson","m_cinematography":"Daniel L.
