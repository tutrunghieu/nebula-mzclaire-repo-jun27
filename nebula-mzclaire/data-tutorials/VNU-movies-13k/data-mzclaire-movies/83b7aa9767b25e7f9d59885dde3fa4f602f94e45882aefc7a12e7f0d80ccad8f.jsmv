{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Approximately thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star, the last remaining Jedi, Luke Skywalker, has disappeared. The First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by Luke's twin sister, General Leia Organa, opposes them while searching for Luke to enlist his aid. | Resistance pilot Poe Dameron meets village elder Lor San Tekka on the planet Jakku to obtain a map to Luke's location. Stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren destroy the village and capture Poe, while Ren kills Tekka. Poe's droid, BB-8 escapes with the map, and encounters the scavenger, Rey near a junkyard settlement. Ren tortures Poe using the Force, and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, unable to bring himself to kill for the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter; Poe dubs FN-2187 \"Finn\". They crash on Jakku, and Finn survives, but is unable to determine if Poe did as well. He encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 flee the planet in the Millennium Falcon, which they steal from a junkyard. | The Falcon breaks down, is caught in a tractor beam, and is captured by a larger ship piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, looking to reclaim their former vessel. Two rival gangs, seeking to settle debts with Han, board and attack, but Han and company manage to escape in the Falcon. The gangs inform the First Order of the events. At the First Order's Starkiller Base – a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses energy from stars – Supreme Leader Snoke orders General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Ren's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Ren replies that Solo means nothing to him. | The Falcon crew views BB-8's map and determines it is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meet with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers assistance in getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn to a vault on the lower level and finds the lightsaber that once belonged to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping. | Starkiller Base fires and destroys the Republic capital and a portion of its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, revealing that he survived the earlier crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Ren captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base. However, when he interrogates her about the map, she is able to resist his mind-reading attempts. Discovering she can use the Force, she escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a nearby guard. | At the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy the superweapon by attacking a critical facility. Leia urges Han to return their son alive. Using the Falcon, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Ren, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Ren refuses and kills his father, enraging Chewbacca, who fires and hits Ren. He sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy Starkiller Base. | The injured Ren pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. A lightsaber battle between Ren and Finn ensues, leaving Finn badly wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Ren, before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring a wounded Ren to him. Rey and Chewbacca escape with Finn in the Falcon. On D'Qar, the Resistance celebrates while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the aquatic planet Ahch-To. She finds Luke and presents him with the lightsaber.","m_cast":"Harrison Ford as Han Solo: | Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: | Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: | Adam Driver as Kylo Ren: | Daisy Ridley as Rey: | John Boyega as Finn: | Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: | Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata: | Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke: | Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux: | Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: | Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: | Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: | Tim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb, both from Return of the Jedi.[30][31] Kipsang Rotich returns as the voice of Nien Nunb[32] and Erik Bauersfeld returns to voice Ackbar.[33] Kenny Baker, originally announced as part of the cast, was credited as \"consultant\" for R2-D2.[34][35] Ewan McGregor has an uncredited vocal cameo as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Rey's vision sequence, while archival audio of Frank Oz and Alec Guinness as Yoda and Kenobi, respectively, are also used in the same scene; Oz recorded new dialogue for the film, but it was replaced with pre-existing audio from The Empire Strikes Back.[36] | Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma, the commander of the First Order's legions of stormtroopers.[37] Dave Chapman and Brian Herring served as puppeteers for BB-8,[38] with Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz credited as \"Vocal Consultants\".[39] Ken Leung appears as Statura, an admiral in the Resistance.[40] Simon Pegg appears as Unkar Plutt, the Junkyard dealer on Jakku.[25][41] Greg Grunberg plays Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley, an X-wing pilot.[42][43] Kiran Shah plays Teedo, a scavenger on Jakku who rides a semi-mechanical Luggabeast.[44] Jessica Henwick appears as Jess \"Testor\" Pava or Jess Testor, an X-wing pilot.[45][46][47] Brian Vernel appears as Bala-Tik, the leader of the Guavian Death Gang.[48][49] Yayan Ruhian, Iko Uwais, and Cecep Arif Rahman appear as Tasu Leech, Razoo Qin-Fee, and Crokind Shand, members of the Kanjiklub Gang, a criminal organization.[50][51][52] Warwick Davis appears as Wollivan, a tavern-dweller in Maz Kanata's castle.[53][54] Anna Brewster appears as Bazine Netal, a First Order spy, also at Maz Kanata's castle.[55] Thomas Brodie-Sangster[56] and Kate Fleetwood[57] play First Order Petty Officers, Thanisson and Unamo, respectively.

It was the 24th film in cinematic history to surpass $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark, doing so in 12 days.[280][281] It was the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.[282] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $780.1 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the most profitable film of 2015 and the most profitable film in the last seven years.[283][284] | The Force Awakens was released in the United States and Canada on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews,[N 1] of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens.[288] On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million from 14,300 screens, marking the biggest single and opening day record[289] and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day.[290] Without Thursday night grosses, the film earned the second largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million).[291] In total, it earned a record $247,966,675 for its debut weekend from nearly 28.8 million tickets sold,[292] including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters,[293][294] which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by Return of the Jedi – the 2nd lowest-grossing film in the series – in its original run.[295] Minus the $57 million it earned from previews, the film earned $190.8 million on straight Friday to Sunday, giving it an average of $63.6 million per day.[291] 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record.[293] Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($59,982 per theater),[296] biggest holiday opening,[297] biggest PG-13 rated opening,[298] and biggest December opening.[299] The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 58% of the audience male, 71% adults, 20% families and 9% teenagers.[291] | Internationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.[300] It opened on December 16, 2015 in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.[301] It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6 million for a two-day international total of $72.7 million, reaching first place in all 44 markets.[302] It grossed a total of $129.5 million in three days after adding $56.8 million on its third day, topped the daily box office in all countries except for South Korea where it was the second,[302] and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6 million.[303] It broke opening day records in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($14.3 million), Germany ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million), Sweden ($1.7 million), Norway ($1.1 million) and in 16 other countries.[288][301][303][304] Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million), Mexico ($3.4 million), Italy ($3.1 million) and Japan ($3 million).[302] After the five days, The Force Awakens had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens in 72 markets, a new record for December opening[300][305] and the third biggest international opening of all time.[306] International markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million) and Japan ($13.4 million) and Russia ($12.3 million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia and Sweden.[300][307] IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters.[294] | After five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which is the biggest worldwide opening, making it only the second time in cinematic history – after Jurassic World – that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally.[305][308] This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million.[308] | Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office[309] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.[310] Revenues from IMAX also dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 10 days.[311] Internationally, the film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million.[312] Of the notable major markets, the film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million.[313] As of February 21, the largest markets outside of the United States and Canada are the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million) and France ($88.2 million).[314] | The Force Awakens crossed the $1 billion mark on the 12th day of its general release (December 26, 2015), making it the fastest film to reach this mark. It became the twenty-fourth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the fifth film of 2015 to do so, making 2015 the first year to have five films gross more than $1 billion.[311] The film experienced another decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 40.8% to $88.2 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[315] to set a third-weekend record.[316] | On January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following Avatar) to gross over $700 million in North America,[317] and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.[318] On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation,[319] and in the same weekend set a Saturday to Sunday opening weekend record for the studio in China with $52.6 million.[320] On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.[321] It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avengers: Age of Ultron to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by The Revenant in its sixth weekend.[322] In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.[322] | On February 5, The Force Awakens became the first film to earn over $900 million in the United States and Canada, doing so on its fiftieth day of release, becoming the first film to reach that milestone unadjusted for inflation.[323][324] On the following day, it became the third film in cinematic history to pass $2 billion in ticket sales worldwide (after Titanic and Avatar) and the second in original release (after Avatar).[325] Also, it became the third film to earn over $600 million in Europe.[325] In North America and the United Kingdom and Ireland, it fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend respectively during the weekend February 26–28, 2016,[326][327] and in the U.S. it fell off $1 million for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.[328] | With a production budget of $306 million,[2] plus $175 million for marketing, printing and advertising costs, The Force Awakens was predicted to be a major box office success.[329] The cost of the film was subsidized by £31.6 million ($47 million USD) from the UK film incentive program.[330] Total costs, after accounting for profit participations, production and distribution of home videos, as well as other ancillary mediums, is expected to run $423 million.[331] Reports in April 2015 from The Hollywood Reporter and Amboee Brand Intelligence predicted the film would earn up to $540 million worldwide for its opening, breaking the record for the biggest worldwide opening, as well as breaking the record for the biggest U.S. opening. They also believed that The Force Awakens would have the widest release ever, across 4,500 theaters in North America.[332] But it ended receiving a total of 4,134 theaters, and nevertheless had the widest December opening.[207] Box office analyst, Phil Contrino likened the film to Avatar (2009), which opened to $77 million in North America and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying The Force Awakens would earn $1 billion \"without blinking\" and could cross $2 billion.[332] In August 2015, Deadline.com predicted an opening weekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a $300 million opening in North America.[333] In November, box office analysts reported opening weekend projections were at $175–250 million.[207][334][335] In December, capital analyst Barton Crockett suggested that the film will be the first to gross over $3 billion worldwide at the box office.[336] | Analysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first Star Wars film made more when this adjustment is made.[337] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[337] Paul Dergarabedian, one of Hollywood's best-known box office analysts, said that while Avatar and The Force Awakens were both released on the same date of December 18, higher ticket prices in 2015 and IMAX screenings could push Star Wars \"into the box office stratosphere\".[338] On December 23, Mark Hughes of Forbes stated that The Force Awakens had matched the most optimistic projections for its opening, and he predicted that The Force Awakens would likely surpass Titanic as the second-highest-grossing film of all time. He also stated that The Force Awakens could catch Avatar as the top-grossing film of all time, but only if it managed to avoid major week-to-week declines in ticket sales.[339] | By January 13, analysts concluded that it was unlikely that The Force Awakens would surpass Avatar's global gross.[340][341] While The Force Awakens is hugely successful in North America, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as Germany, India, Latin America, and parts of Asia. One cited reason for this is that overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in the U.S.[340][341][342] The Star Wars franchise has also traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, which is why part of the marketing for The Force Awakens heavily focused on appealing to that territory.[341][343] Pamela McClintock stated that, for these territories, Star Wars \"doesn't have the same legacy as it does in North America and more mature markets. It's also a faster burn, meaning it likely won't stay in theaters as long as Avatar did.\"[340] Dergarabedian said, \"As in all box-office trajectories, the higher the altitude, the tougher it becomes to rack up sales at the kind of breakneck pace as in the beginning of the run.\"[340] | Nancy Tartaglione of Deadline.com argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, The Force Awakens did well overseas.[342] Avatar did well internationally because of its novelty, the marketing campaign advertising it as showcasing the newest 3D technology that can only be fully appreciated in the theaters, and because of its extended time in overseas theaters.[341] While The Force Awakens had appeal with its special effects, analysts feel that it lacked the novelty factor; they also cite that its gross was additionally stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done. Films do not play in overseas theaters as long as they did back when Avatar was released.[341] Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [The Force Awakens] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\"[340] Moreover, Mike Fleming of Deadline.com argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney an astounding $923M, and the Cash on Cash Return twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.31\".[344] | Star Wars: The Force Awakens received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.[345] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 92% approval rating, based on 354 reviews, with a rating average of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy.\"[346] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[347] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, under-25s and under-18s gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it an \"A\" or \"B\".[348] | Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave The Force Awakens five stars out of five and wrote that it \"sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past. That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\"[349] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it five stars out of five, writing that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot ... ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\"[350] Variety's Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans.\"[351] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising and heart-thumping adventure.\"[352] Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original Star Wars, it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind ... the energy, humor and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured.\"[353] The Associated Press called it \"basically the same\" as the original film, but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"[354] | Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans ... The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\"[355] Christopher Orr, writing in The Atlantic, called the film \"a mashup masterpiece\" that \"may be completely derivative\" but is \"a delight nonetheless.\"[356] The Charlotte Observer's Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\"[357] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best Star Wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015.\"[358] Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Money, found it was the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike.\"[359] Jack Bottomley, writing for Starburst, awarded the film 10 out of 10 saying, \"From old joys to fresh twists, this is a unique blockbuster experience that celebrates the franchise whilst also expanding it.\"[360] | Some critics found the film too derivative of previous Star Wars films.[90] Andrew O'Hehir wrote for Salon that it was \"the work of a talented mimic or ventriloquist who can just about cover for the fact that he has nothing much to say.\"[361] Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted.\"[362] Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture.\"[363] Brian Merchant wrote for Motherboard: \"Science fiction is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod ... one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"[364] | Several awards held their nominations before the December release of The Force Awakens, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies.[365] However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards's slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors,[366] and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of The Force Awakens,[365] where it was named one of Top Ten Films of the year.[367] | The film received five Academy Award nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, including Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects.[368] The film garnered four nominations at the 69th British Academy Film Awards for Best Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Production Design, including two wins, one for Best Special Visual Effects and a BAFTA Rising Star Award for John Boyega.[369] It was nominated for Best Picture at the 2016 Critics' Choice Awards.[370] The film received seven Visual Effects Society Awards nominations, winning four, including Outstanding Visual Effects in an Effects Driven Feature Motion Picture.[371] It received the most nominations at the 21st Empire Awards, including Best Film, Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film, Best Director for J.J. Abrams, Best Male Newcomer for John Boyega, and Best Female Newcomer for Daisy Ridley.[372] It became the most nominated film in Saturn Award history with a total of 13 nominations at the 42nd Saturn Awards, where it won in eight categories, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Actor for Ford, Best Supporting Actor for Driver, Best Music, Best Special Effects, Best Editing, and Best Make-Up.[373][374] | Daisy Ridley and John Boyega each received several nominations and accolades for their performances. They were nominated as Best Newcomers at various critics circle and associations, including the Alliance of Women Film Journalists,[375] the Florida Film Critics Circle,[376] and the Online Film & Television Association Awards.[377] The Force Awakens received eleven nominations at the MTV Movie Awards, the most for the ceremony, including Movie of the Year, Best Female Performance for Ridley, Best Breakthrough Performance for Boyega, and Best Visual Performance for Lupita Nyong'o and Andy Serkis.[378] | In addition to several awards and nominations, The Force Awakens appeared on several critics' lists of the ten best films of 2015.[379]","m_production":"Star Wars creator George Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it.[81] In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm, and with it the Star Wars franchise, to The Walt Disney Company.[82] Speaking alongside Lucasfilm's new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: \"I always said I wasn't going to do any more and that's true, because I'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.\"[83] | As creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe.[82] Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII–IX, which Lucas requested would only be read by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan Horn, and Kevin Mayer.[84] Lucas later stated that Disney had discarded his story ideas[85][86] and that he had no further involvement with the film.[87] Lucas' son Jett told The Guardian that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise, despite having hand-picked Abrams to direct, and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation.\"[88] | In November 2015, Lucas said that Disney was \"not that keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\"[89] In December 2015, after the film's release, he said: \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different ... I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\"[90][91] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.[92] | Episode VII's first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.[93][94][95][96] Early drafts had Luke appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\"[97] Luke became the film's MacGuffin and does not appear in person until the final scene.[97] Several directors were considered, including David Fincher,[98] Brad Bird,[99] Ben Affleck and Guillermo del Toro;[100] After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy,[101] J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.[102][103] | Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.[96] The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties.[104] Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release.[105] He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks.[106] Abrams said that the key for the film was to return to the roots of the first Star Wars film and be based more on emotion than explanation.[107] In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.[108] | A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Maria Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\";[109] Forsberg developed the language by studying languages such as Hindi and Gujarati.[109] | In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–IX would not feature storylines from the expanded universe, though other elements could be included as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.[110] | Abrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from Episode VII, such as Finn and Rey's last names and their backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams is collaborating with Episode VIII director Rian Johnson, and then Johnson will work with Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow, to ensure a smooth transition and \"that everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\".[111] | In May 2013, it was confirmed that Episode VII would be filmed in the United Kingdom.[112] Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce Episode VII in the UK.[112] Osborne committed £25 million ($37 million) of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and the film industry.[113] | Beginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of Episode VII for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[114] | The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness films.[115] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, also long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[116] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[117] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Daniel Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisor Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.[118][119][120][121] | Casting began around August 2013, with Abrams meeting with potential actors for script readings and screen tests. Open auditions were held in the UK, Ireland, and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas.[122][123][124] Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.[125] Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement on April 29, 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks prior. Actors testing had strict non-disclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or publicists from commenting on their potential involvement.[126] | Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013,[82] their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.[34] Saoirse Ronan,[127] Michael B. Jordan,[128] and Lupita Nyong'o[129] auditioned for new characters; industry publications reported Jesse Plemons was considered, possibly for Luke Skywalker's son;[130] Adam Driver for an unnamed villain;[131] and Maisie Richardson-Sellers for an unknown character.[132] In March 2014, actor Dominic Monaghan said that Abrams was looking for three unknown actors to play the leads in Episode VII and that rumors of bigger-name stars were untrue.[133] | Daisy Ridley was chosen for the film by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his Girls schedule. By March 2014, talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began and continued into April 2014. In April, John Boyega began talks after dropping out of a Jesse Owens biopic.[126] Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, stating that it would have \"bored\" him.[134] | On April 29, 2014, the cast was announced with a photo of the first table read of the script at Pinewood Studios near London,[34] picturing director Abrams with Ford, Ridley, Fisher, Peter Mayhew, producer Bryan Burk, Lucasfilm president and producer Kathleen Kennedy, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Hamill, Serkis, Oscar Isaac, Boyega, Driver, and writer Lawrence Kasdan. The announcement was originally planned for May 4 (Star Wars Day), but was announced early for fear of media leaks. In June 2014, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.[135] | To prepare for his role, Hamill grew out his beard[136] and was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.[137] Fisher was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.[137] Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO,[138] but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO suit to accommodate him.[139] | In May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the Star Wars set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.[140] In October 2014, Warwick Davis, who played Wald and Weazle in The Phantom Menace and Wicket in Return of the Jedi, announced that he would appear in The Force Awakens, but did not reveal his role.[141] In November 2014, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, is in the film.[58] Isaac's uncle, a Star Wars fan, was cast as an extra at the invitation of Abrams upon visiting the set.[142] | In December 2015, The Mail reported that Ford will be paid $25 million plus a 0.5% share of the revenue. Ridley and Boyega each will receive $460,000 plus a share if the movie grosses over $1 billion. Fisher received $1.5 million and Abrams was paid $5.1 million plus a 2% share of the revenue. For the original 1977 film, Ford was paid $10,000 (equivalent to $39,000 in 2015).[143] | In February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.[107] The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[144] That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would be taking place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots which would be used for scenery in the film.[145] In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,[146] filming in secret in the U.A.E. emirate of Abu Dhabi by a second-unit.[147][148] Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65mm IMAX format.[149] In July, Bad Robot reported on Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.[150] | On May 4, 2014 (Star Wars Day), the studio posted a selfie taken by Iger with an unidentified actor in a Chewbacca costume.[151] Iger stated the photo was taken when he visited Pinewood Studios two weeks earlier to discuss the shoot, \"which was just about to start\", with Abrams, Kennedy, and Horn.[152] Principal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.[153][154][155] Abrams and members of the cast went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built at the location, including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower and a big market, and explosives were used to create a \"blast crater.\" Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.[156] Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.[157] | In June, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle.\"[96] Production was suspended for two weeks to accommodate Ford's injury.[158] Ford's son Ben stated that Ford's ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.[159] Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said in July that Ford was recovering rapidly.[160] Abrams also fractured a vertebra in his own back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident.[96] However, he kept this to himself and did not tell anyone about it for over a month.[161] In February 2016 it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK) Ltd for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.[162] | One of the film's storyboard artists, Simon Duric, said \"The security on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe. Most of the time on a film you can sit at your desk with a copy of the script next to you. On this, you couldn’t. That’s fine but it was tricky in places. We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts. If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in a big black sheet. We were told in an email to be [wary] of drones.\"[163] | In July 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.[164][165] Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the north west of England.[166] Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford during mid-August.[167][168] In September 2014, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire, was used as a filming location and featured set constructions of several spaceships from the Star Wars Universe.[169][170] Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean was used as a location for forest scenes.[171][172] Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.[173] | Cinematographer Daniel Mindel stated that The Force Awakens would use real locations and scale models over computer-generated imagery to make it aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy.[174] Rian Johnson, director of Episode VIII, reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\"[175] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars.[176] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research,[177] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[178][179] | In February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's Star Wars films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch will also work on the special effects for the film.[180] | Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.[96] In August 2015, Abrams gave the estimated running time of the film as 124–125 minutes.[181] Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value, except to be sitting around.\"[182] The film was converted to 3D in post-production.[183] | It's all a continuation of an initial set of ideas. It's a bit like adding paragraphs to a letter that's been going on for a number of years. Starting with a completely new film, a story that I don't know, characters that I haven't met, my whole approach to writing music is completely different—trying to find an identity, trying to find melodic identifications if that's needed for the characters, and so on. | In July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to compose the score.[185] The music for the film's first two trailers was reworked from earlier Williams compositions.[186][187][188] He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.[188][189] In May 2015, Williams stated that he would return to themes from the previous films, such as ones for Luke, Leia and Han, in ways that \"will seem very natural and right in the moments for which we've chosen to do these kinds of quotes. There aren't many of them, but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.[184] | Recording sessions for The Force Awakens began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.[190] The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.[191] Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings.[192][193] | Williams said the recording process was \"very luxurious\", with 12 sessions scattered over a five-month period between June and November. The score was recorded by a freelance orchestra, with sessions continuing on and off over that five-month period. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music, although nearly an hour of that was discarded, modified, or rerecorded as Abrams re-edited the film. Williams's theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus. Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.[194] Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.[188][189][195] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.[196] Williams's score is more than two hours long.[189] | Lin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene, similar to the Mos Eisley Cantina. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical Hamilton, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose the cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score for the film. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two began to collaborate on the music for the scene, over a period of two months.[197] | South Korean boy band EXO released their song \"Lightsaber\" in collaboration with the film for its release in their home country on November 11.[198] The promoted track was subsequently released as part of their Sing for You album with a Chinese version,[199] as well as also being released in Japanese.[200] Chinese pop singer Luhan provided the Chinese theme \"Inner Force\" for the Chinese release of the film.[201]","m_sequel":"Rian Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct Episode VIII.[175] It is scheduled for release on December 15, 2017.[380] Some second-unit filming took place in September 2015 in Ireland,[381][382] with principal photography beginning in February 2016 at Pinewood Studios.[383][384][385] Hamill, Fisher, Driver, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Nyong'o, Gleeson, Daniels, Christie, Serkis, and Mayhew will reprise their roles in the film, and are joined by Benicio del Toro, Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran.[386] Jimmy Vee will replace Baker as R2-D2.[387][388] | In August 2015, Colin Trevorrow was announced as the director of Episode IX,[389] scheduled for release on May 24, 2019.[390]","m_based_on":"Characters  by George Lucas","m_directed_by":"J.

J. Abrams. The seventh installment in the main Star Wars film series, it stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow. Produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and Abrams' Bad Robot Productions and distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, The Force Awakens is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi; it follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight alongside the Resistance, led by veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor group to the Galactic Empire. | The Force Awakens is the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy announced after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous six films, returned to compose its score. Star Wars creator George Lucas served as creative consultant during the film's early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in England, and concluded in November 2014. It is the first live-action film in the franchise since Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, released in 2005. | Star Wars: The Force Awakens was widely anticipated, with Disney backing the film through extensive marketing campaigns.[4][5] It premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015, four days before its release in North America. The film received mostly positive reviews. J.J Abrams' direction, the dialogue, the action sequences, the characters, visual effects, John Williams' musical score, and the performances of the cast, particularly those of Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver were the areas that received the most praise. The film broke many box office records, becoming the highest-grossing installment of the franchise, the highest-grossing film in North America, and the third highest grossing film of all time with a worldwide gross of more than $2 billion.[6][7] It received five Academy Award nominations and four British Academy Film Award nominations, where it won Best Special Visual Effects. Two sequels, Episode VIII and Episode IX, are scheduled for 2017 and 2019 respectively. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\".
