{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The first three X-Men films and Deadpool set opening records in North America: X-Men had the highest July opening yet,[111] while X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand earned the fourth highest opening weekends yet and Deadpool got the largest opening weekend in February.[112][113][114] The records for the first three films have since been surpassed. The next three X-Men films after X-Men: The Last Stand opened lower than their predecessor and didn't set opening records.[115] In North America, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series, and it also has the highest opening weekend.[110][114] Outside North America, X-Men: Days of Future Past has the highest opening weekend and is the highest-grossing film in the series.[110] Worldwide, Deadpool is the highest grossing film in the series.[110] | The X-Men film series is the second highest-grossing film series based on Marvel Comics characters after Marvel Cinematic Universe.[116] In North America, it is the seventh highest-grossing film franchise, having earned over $1.8 billion.[117] Worldwide, it is the seventh highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $4.3 billion.[110] | Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe praised the first three X-Men films as \"more than a cash-guzzling wham-bang Hollywood franchise... these three movies sport philosophy, ideas, a telethon-load of causes, and a highly elastic us-versus-them allegory.\" Morris praised X-Men: The Last Stand for \"put[ting] the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position. Realism at this time of year? How unorthodox!\"[138] Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews, but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating \"their powers are so various and ill-matched that it's hard to keep them all on the same canvas.\"[139] | The first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone. However, when director Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt \"Singer's sensitivity to [the discrimination themes] made the first two X-Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups.\"[140] James Berardinelli felt, \"X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as taut or satisfying as X-Men 2, but it's better constructed and better paced than the original X-Men. The differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, there seems to be a single vision.\"[141] David Denby of The New Yorker praised \"the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work\", but called Ratner's film \"a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes.\"[142] Singer's third film in the series, X-Men: Days of Future Past was also highly praised. Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that \"Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down\".[143] | The X-Men films were well-received by fans of the comic books, but there was criticism of the large cast, and the limited screentime for all of them. Richard George of IGN praised the depictions of Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto, Jean Grey, Storm, William Stryker, Mystique, Beast and Nightcrawler; however, George thought many of the younger X-Men characters, such as Rogue, Iceman, Pyro and Kitty Pryde were \"adjectiveless teenager[s]\", and was disappointed by Cyclops' characterization. He observed the filmmakers were \"big fans of silent henchmen\", due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants; such as Lady Deathstrike.[144] Spider-Man director Sam Raimi said he was a fan of the series, particularly Singer's films.[145] Film historian Kim Newman also tonally compared Batman Begins to Singer's films.[146] | Richard George of IGN stated that the success of the first X-Men film paved the way for comic-book film adaptations such as the Spider-Man series, Fantastic Four, V for Vendetta and Singer's Superman Returns.[144] Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine called the first X-Men film as the \"catalyst\" for films based on Marvel Comics characters stating \"Singer’s 2000 movie is the catalyst for everything that’s come since, good and bad. Without it, there’s no Marvel Studios.\"[147] Comic-book writer Mark Millar said that Singer's X-Men \"revolutionized\" superhero films.[148]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":null,"m_produced_by":"Lauren Shuler Donner","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"See below","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":null,"m_running_time":null,"m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$1.261 billion (9 films)","m_box_office":"$4,362,322,072 (9 films) | The X-Men film series is an American series of superhero films based on the fictional superhero team of the same name, who originally appeared in a series of comic books created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and published by Marvel Comics. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct X-Men (2000) and its sequel, X2 (2003), while Brett Ratner directed X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). | After each film earned higher box-office grosses than its predecessor, several spin-off films were released, X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), X-Men: First Class (2011) and The Wolverine (2013). X-Men: Days of Future Past, a sequel to both X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class, was released in 2014. Deadpool and X-Men: Apocalypse followed in 2016. | X-Men, X2, X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past and the spin-offs The Wolverine and Deadpool were all met with positive reviews, with X-Men: Days of Future Past as the best-received film in the series. In the cases of X-Men and X2, critics especially highlighted their dark, realistic tones and subtexts dealing with discrimination and intolerance, while Deadpool was highlighted for its \"faithful\" interpretation of the source material and for its R rating. X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: Apocalypse were met with mixed reviews from critics. | With nine films released, the X-Men film series is the seventh highest-grossing film franchise of all-time, having grossed over US$4.3 billion worldwide. It is set to continue with the release of a third Wolverine film in 2017. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Jensen, Jeff (July 21, 2000). \"Generating X\". Entertainment Weekly.
