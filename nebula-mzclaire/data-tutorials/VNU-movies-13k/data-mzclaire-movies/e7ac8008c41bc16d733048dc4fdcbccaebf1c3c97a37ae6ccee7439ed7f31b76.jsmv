{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Long ago, a drop of sunlight became a golden flower capable of healing illness, decay and injury. For hundreds of years the flower is used by Mother Gothel to retain her youth until it is discovered by soldiers of a nearby kingdom, Corona. They use the flower to heal their ailing queen, who soon afterwards gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's hair has the flower's healing properties. However, attempting to take just the hair by cutting a piece from it destroys its power, and so she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter's return. | Nearing her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel asks Gothel for permission to leave the tower and discover the source of the lanterns, but Gothel refuses, telling her that the outside world is a dangerous place. Elsewhere, a thief known as Flynn Rider has stolen Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his cohorts, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to show Flynn to Gothel in order to prove she can take care of herself, but when Gothel becomes enraged at Rapunzel's insistent desire to leave, she asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return. Gothel agrees and departs. Rapunzel convinces Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the crown. | During their excursion, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with the frightening people Gothel warned Rapunzel about, but who instead are charmed by Rapunzel's innocence. When the royal soldiers appear searching for Flynn, the pub regulars help the pair escape. The soldiers give chase, led by Maximus, one of the lead horses in the royal army, and locate them at a dam. The dam is inadvertently breached, and the resulting deluge traps Flynn and Rapunzel in a flooding cave. Fearing this is the end, Flynn reveals his real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel starts to reveal that her hair glows when she sings – but then realizes that this is their key to escape, as her hair provides enough light to find a way out of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to challenge Eugene's interest in her. | The next morning, Maximus finds the pair and tries to capture Eugene, but Rapunzel arranges a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reaches the kingdom and enjoys the festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown. When he sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, Eugene leaves Rapunzel and intends to let them have the crown. Instead, the brothers tie Eugene onto a boat and confront Rapunzel, claiming Eugene is escaping with the crown. Gothel then stages a rescue by betraying the brothers and returns Rapunzel to the tower as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are arrested by the royal guards. | Back at the tower, Rapunzel recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had subconsciously incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess, she confronts Gothel. As Eugene is being led to execution, he is rescued by the Snuggly Duckling regulars and carried back to Gothel's tower by Maximus. Eugene enters the tower by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel bound with chains and gagged with a handkerchief. Gothel then stabs him with a knife and attempts to leave with a struggling Rapunzel. Rapunzel agrees to lifelong captivity if she is allowed to heal Eugene, but before she has the chance to save him, Eugene slices off her hair, turning it from golden blonde to brown and destroying its magic. Gothel's age rapidly catches up to her, and she falls from the tower, disintegrating into dust. As Eugene dies, a heartbroken Rapunzel's tear, which still contains a bit of the sun's power, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom, where Rapunzel is re-united with her parents. The kingdom breaks out in celebration, and Eugene is pardoned for his crimes. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Tangled premiered in Paris on November 17, exclusively screening at the Grand Rex theatre two weeks in advance of its French wide release.[63] With over 3,800 tickets sold on its opening day, it set a new record for films showing in a single theater.[64] It had a worldwide opening weekend of $86.1 million,[65][66] and reached the summit of the worldwide box office once, on its eleventh weekend (Feb 4–6, 2011), with $24.9 million.[67][68] Tangled earned $200,821,936 in North America, and $390,973,000 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $591,794,936.[3] It was the third Disney film appearing in the Top 10 films of 2010.[69] As of 2014, it was the fourth highest-grossing film worldwide produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, behind Frozen, The Lion King, and Big Hero 6.[70] | Tangled earned $11.9 million on its opening Wednesday,[71] breaking the record for the largest pre-Thanksgiving Wednesday opening, a record previously held by Disney·Pixar's Toy Story 2.[72] In its first weekend of release, it earned $48.8 million (the highest opening for Walt Disney Animation Studios, surpassing The Lion King ($40.9 million), and later surpassed by both Wreck-It Ralph ($49 million) and Frozen ($67.4 million)), placing second for the period behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, which earned $49.1 million.[73] Tangled had the sixth highest opening weekend for a film that did not debut at #1.[74] Over the traditional Wednesday-Sunday Thanksgiving holiday period, it tallied $68.7 million, again finishing in second place.[73] Tangled also marked the second largest 3-day and 5-day Thanksgiving opening after Toy Story 2.[73] During its second weekend (post-Thanksgiving), Tangled declined 56% to $21.6 million, although it jumped to first place at the box office.[75] With a final gross of $200.8 million, it is the tenth highest-grossing film of 2010,[76] and the tenth 2010 film to pass the $200 million mark;[77] it was the fourth slowest film to pass this mark.[78] Unadjusted for inflation, it is the sixth highest-grossing film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, behind The Lion King ($422.8 million), Frozen ($400.7 million), Big Hero 6 ($221.3 million), Beauty and the Beast ($219 million), and Aladdin ($217.4 million).[79] | On its opening weekend, it earned $17.4 million in eight territories and ranked second for the weekend behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 ($117.3 million).[80] It reached first place at the weekend box office outside North America three times in 2011.[81][82][83] It marked the seventh highest-grossing 2010 film and the third highest-grossing 2010 animated film.[84] In Russia and the CIS, it set an opening-weekend record among non-sequel animated films (first surpassed by Rio) and among Walt Disney Animation Studios films (surpassed by Frozen).[85] Its highest-grossing markets outside North America was Germany ($44.2 million), where it is the highest-grossing 2010 animated film,[86] followed by France and the Maghreb region ($39.4 million) and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($32.9 million).[87] | Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 90% based on 215 reviews and an average score of 7.5/10.[88] The site's consensus is: \"While far from Disney's greatest film, Tangled is a visually stunning, thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio's classic animated canon.\"[88] Another review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score from 0–100 out of reviews from mainstream film critics, calculated a score of 71 based on 34 reviews.[89] According to CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, the average grade cinemagoers gave Tangled was an \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.[90] | A. O. Scott of The New York Times positively reviewed the film as \"the 50th animated feature from Disney, and its look and spirit convey a modified, updated but nonetheless sincere and unmistakable quality of old-fashioned Disneyness.\"[91] Time film critic Richard Corliss wrote that Tangled \"wades into the DreamWorks style of sitcom gags and anachronistic sass,\" while praising the film for achieving \"the complex mix of romance, comedy, adventure and heart that defines the best Disney features.\"[92] Corliss included Tangled at 19 in a list of top 25 All-time Best Animated films.[93] Kenneth Turan from The Los Angeles Times awarded the film four stars out of five; he described the film as a \"gorgeous computer-animated look that features rich landscapes and characters that look fuller and more lifelike than they have in the past.\"[94] Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media gave the film five out of five stars, writing, \"Fantastic princess adventure is fun, with great messages.\"[95] Gael Cooper of NBC News expressed that Tangled may be the best Disney film of all time.[96] | James Berardinelli commented on his review website ReelViews that the film is \"entertaining and enjoyable, but not groundbreaking.\" He also stated Rapunzel is \"not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle\" as well as stating \"the songs are neither catchy nor memorable.\"[97] Todd McCarthy, film reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter opened his review with, \"It would have been nice if Disney's self-touted 50th animated feature were one of its best, a film that could stand with the studio's classics, but the world will have to make do with Tangled, a passably entertaining hodgepodge of old and new animation techniques, mixed sensibilities and hedged commercial calculations.\"[98] | Music in the film received mixed reviews. Bill Graham from Collider.com praised them for their variations to the tempo and tone, memorable lyrics, and \"blending old with new,\" However, he also stated that \"the film’s constant mixture of tones can feel a bit off-putting for some.\"[99] Roth Cornet from ScreenRant was positive towards them, saying that \"Alan Menken’s music is as catchy, uplifting and effecting as one would expect.\"[100] Scott of The New York Times positively reviewed the music, saying that it \"takes you back to a charmed world of swoony longing and sprightly mischief,\" with a slick and efficient atmosphere and grace notes of self-conscious classicism.[91] Corliss from Time was also positive to the songs, noting that though \"don't sound on first hearing like top-drawer Menken,\" the songs still \"smoothly fill their functions.\" He described the opener, \"When Will My Life Begin?,\" as the \"heroine's 'I wanna' song,\" a Disney tradition that stretches back to Snow White's \"Some Day My Prince Will Come.\" \"I See the Light\" was described as \"a generically tuneful love ballad, which is sure to be nominated for a Best Song Oscar.\"[92] | James Berardinelli, on the other hand, negatively commented the songs as \"neither catchy nor memorable.\"[97] Tim Robey from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review, saying that they were only \"OK – there’s nothing you want to whistle on the way home.\"[101] Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian, who gave the movie two out of five star, described the songs as \"sporting a laboured selection of Broadway-style showtunes,\" and hence are actually added for profit.[102] | When first put into production, the film was promoted as having the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which was later changed to Rapunzel.[103] Disney's previous animated feature The Princess and the Frog in 2009, while being well-received by various critics[104] and taking in nearly $270 million worldwide, was not as successful as Disney had hoped. Catmull would later admit in writing that Disney Animation's faith that the The Princess and the Frog's excellent quality would bring in all audiences notwithstanding the word \"princess\" in the title was their version of \"a stupid pill.\"[105] In order to market the film to both sexes and additional age groups, Disney changed the film's name from Rapunzel to Tangled while also emphasizing Flynn Rider, the film's prominent male character, showing that his story is just as important as Rapunzel's.[106] Disney was criticized for altering the classic title as a marketing strategy. Floyd Norman, a former Disney and Pixar animator and story artist, said, \"The idea of changing the title of a classic like Rapunzel to Tangled is beyond stupid. I'm convinced they'll gain nothing from this except the public seeing Disney as desperately trying to find an audience.\"[107] | Justin Chang of Variety compared it to changing the title of The Little Mermaid to Beached.[108] Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle's blog, Margot Magowan accused Disney of sexism, writing, \"Can you imagine if Disney...switched a movie title so it wouldn't risk highlighting a male star? It's awful that this kind of radical gender discrimination exists for our smallest people – little kids who come into this world with huge imaginations and aspirations, big dreams that get squashed by a bunch of billionaire guys who run massive entertainment franchises.\"[109] | On November 24, 2010, the day of the film's release, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard disputed reports that the title change was a marketing decision. They said they changed the title from Rapunzel to Tangled, because Rapunzel is not the only main character in the film. They went on to say that you cannot call Toy Story \"Buzz Lightyear,\" and they really needed a title that represented what the film is, and that it's a duo, and it stars Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.[110] | In March 2014, executive producer John Lasseter explained that Disney had changed the name to improve the film's appeal to the four quadrants: \"There was an audience perception that these movies were just for little girls[,] but when boys, men, whatever actually see these movies[,] they like them. So on Rapunzel ... we changed the name and we called it Tangled. We did marketing that made the people who would not normally show up say, 'Hey, this looks pretty good.'\"[111] | The film has been nominated for a number of awards. Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated Tangled for two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song for \"I See the Light\", but lost to Toy Story 3 and Burlesque respectively.[112] The film also received two nominations for the Broadcast Film Critics Association in the same categories, though lost to Toy Story 3 and 127 Hours,[113] as well as nominations for two Annie Awards, for Best Animated Feature Film and for Writing in a Feature Production.[114] | Tangled was also nominated for two Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, Best Animated Film and Best Original Song for \"I've Got a Dream,\" which it lost to Toy Story 3 and Burlesque.[115] \"I See the Light\" has been nominated for Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to \"We Belong Together\" from Toy Story 3.[116] It has also been nominated for 37th Saturn Award for Best Animated Film.[117] | Tangled won best 3D scene of the year at the second annual International 3D Society Creative Arts Awards.[118] | Tangled was also nominated for favorite film in the British Academy Children Awards for Favorite Film, competing against films like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Parts 1 & 2, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Cars 2, and Kung Fu Panda 2.[119][120] | ","m_production":"On September 10, 2009, it was announced that actress and singer-songwriter Mandy Moore had been cast as the voice of Rapunzel, and actor Zachary Levi would provide the voice of Flynn Rider.[5][6][22] Mandy Moore approached the project through auditioning, when she heard that a film about the story of Rapunzel was being made.[19][23] Moore later expressed that she had dreamed to be a Disney princess since she was young and said that with the role of Rapunzel, she had fulfilled her \"ultimate childhood dream\".[24] She described herself as a \"girly fan\" of Disney classics[24] like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, and that it was an honor for her to be part of this \"legacy\" – the lineage of such Disney icons.[25] Since the film was going to be a musical, it was required that all auditionees had to read several scenes and perform a song of their choice, to ensure that the voice actors could both act and sing.[26][27] For this singing section, Moore chose \"Help Me\" by Joni Mitchell,[19] a song that she herself had covered on her fourth studio album, Coverage (2003).[28][29] Moore revealed that she had to attend several audition sessions[25][26] and described the experiences as \"pretty fun\" but didn't put much hope in getting the part because she believed there would be much competition for this role;[23] she just performed her best without any anxiety.[19] When she received a callback from Disney telling that she got the part, Moore described herself as being \"over the moon\": \"I was working in New York at the time. I was with some friends and my husband – and I screamed as soon as I found out the news.\"[19] | The film reportedly cost more than $260 million to produce.[2] | In Tangled, as with most animated films, all voice actors had to record their dialogue separately from one another to avoid bleeding into each other's tracks.[30] Mandy Moore later recalled that during recording, she had never met Donna Murphy and only met Zachary Levi once when they recorded \"I See the Light\".[30] Moore thought that this was \"a good exercise in employing your imagination\".[31] When recording action scenes, the voice actors had to jog a little in place in order to make their voices sound realistic.[31] For the songs, Moore and Levi recorded on a soundstage with a 65-piece orchestra under the supervision of composer Alan Menken. They sang live with the orchestra for several times in order to help everyone \"get a vibe\" and a feel for the music and the singing, then were asked to go in isolation booths to record the actual tracks.[32][33] In order to aid animators in animating the characters, the filmmakers did interviews with the voice actors and filmed their facial expressions throughout the recording sessions.[31] Disney animated films are usually animated to synchronize with recorded dialogue rather than asking the vocal talent to synchronize their delivery to animation after it is rendered. Thus, Moore felt that the recording process was challenging because at that time she had no animation to look at except for a few sketches.[19] | Due to scheduling conflicts with other projects (Moore had to travel to different places like London or New York, and Levi could only record on weekends for five hours once every six weeks), they did not necessarily record dialogue in the same order as in the final film. \"[When I came in], maybe that sequence or scene had been recorded by Mandy (Moore) already, maybe it hadn't. We'd end up doing the same scene five times, depending,\" Levi said.[27] After watching the finished film, Moore was disappointed because she felt that her voice sounded \"shrill\", while Levi thought that his performance sounded \"incredibly nasally\".[31] | The film was made using computer-generated imagery (CGI), although Tangled was modeled on the traditional look of oil paintings on canvas. The Rococo paintings of French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard, particularly The Swing, were used as references for the film's artistic style, a style described by Keane as \"romantic and lush.\"[34] To create the impression of a painting, non-photorealistic rendering was used.[35] | Glen Keane originally wanted the film to be animated using a traditional 2D animation process. However, Disney executives David Stainton and Dick Cook announced that they would only approve the film for production if it were created using the 3D computer graphics.[36] In response to that demand, Glen Keane held a seminar called \"The Best of Both Worlds\", where he, with 50 Disney CGI artists and traditional artists, focused on the pros and cons of each style.[37] After the meeting, it was decided that the film would be made in 3D CG animation, but in a way as to become an extension of the traditional 2D Disney \"aesthetic\", a term which referred to the naturalistic animation that conforms to the fundamental principles of animation as documented by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in the book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation.[36] | Due to limitations in computer technology, especially regarding attempts to capture the complexity of a human form, many basic principles of animation used in traditionally animated movies had been absent from earlier CGI films; but technological advancements have made it easier to blend the two, combining the strengths of each style.[35] Keane stated repeatedly he was trying to make the computer \"bend its knee to the artist\" instead of having the computer dictate the artistic style and look of the film.[10] By making the computer become as \"pliable as the pencil\", Keane's vision of a \"three dimensional drawing\" seemed within reach, with the artist controlling the technology. Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started, and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own.[34] Keane said, \"There’s no photoreal hair. I want luscious hair, and we are inventing new ways of doing that. I want to bring the warmth and intuitive feel of hand-drawn to CGI.\"[38] | One of the main goals of the animators was to create movement that mimicked the soft fluidity of the hand-drawn art found in older Disney animated films. Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand-drawn style.[35] \"He took the house from Snow White and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move, and it had dimension and kept all of the soft, round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor. Kyle helped us get that Fragonard look of that girl on the swing... We are using subsurface scattering and global illumination and all of the latest techniques to pull off convincing human characters and rich environments.\"[34] | Rather than focusing on realism, the 3D team used an aesthetic approach.[35] Robert Newman, the film’s stereoscopic supervisor said that \"We’re using depth more artistically than ever before, and we’re not as concerned with the literal transcription of depth between camera and projector as we are the interpretation of it.\" To do this, they used a new technique called multi-rigging, which is made up of multiple pairs of virtual cameras. Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene, like background, foreground and characters, without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs. When sandwiched together later in production, the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world, but which created an appealing look to the film.[39] | As a counterpart to the appealing and cute design of Rapunzel,[40] the directors wanted to make Flynn Rider \"the most handsome, most attractive male lead Disney has ever had.\"[41] They held a large \"Hot Man Meeting\" where they gathered about 30 women from the studio and asked them what they considered attractive in a man.[42] They brought in hundreds of images of their favourite male actors and celebrities, which were torn and pasted back again.[42][43] After much deliberation, his look was eventually narrowed down to one concept drawing.[41][42] | Existing technology continued to present difficulties: in particular, animating hair turned out to be a challenge. Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted.[44] As late as January 2010, the directors were still not sure if the Rapunzel character's length of hair was going to work. These problems were finally solved in March:[45] An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires, originally developed for Bolt, was eventually used. To make hair float believably in water, and to surmount other similar challenges, discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects, freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly, which would have taken days instead of minutes.[46]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Rapunzel  by Brothers Grimm","m_directed_by":"Nathan Greno | Byron Howard","m_produced_by":"Roy Conli | John Lasseter | Glen Keane","m_screenplay_by":"Dan Fogelman","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mandy Moore | Zachary Levi | Donna Murphy","m_music_by":"Alan Menken","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Tim Mertens","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures","m_release_dates":"November 14, 2010 (2010-11-14) (El Capitan Theatre) | November 24, 2010 (2010-11-24) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$260 million[2][3]","m_box_office":"$591.8 million[3] | Tangled is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy-comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Loosely based on the German fairy tale \"Rapunzel\" in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm, it is the 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi,[4] the film tells the story of a lost, young princess with long magical hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. Against her mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of a handsome intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen. | Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled, reportedly to market the film as gender-neutral.[2] Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fifth most-expensive film of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled. | Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film was well received by critics and audiences alike. The film earned $591 million in worldwide box office revenue,[3] $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2011; A sequel short, Tangled Ever After, was released later in 2012. A television series will premiere in 2017. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Tangled: 100 minutes (Starz 08/2011 Schedule, Page 4)\" (PDF).  | ^ a b c Chmielewski, Dawn C.; Eller, Claudia (November 21, 2010). \"Disney Animation is closing the book on fairy tales\".
