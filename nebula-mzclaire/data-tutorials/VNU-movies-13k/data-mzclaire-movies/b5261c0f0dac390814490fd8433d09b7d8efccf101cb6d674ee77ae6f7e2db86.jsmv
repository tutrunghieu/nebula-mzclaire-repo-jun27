Their production company, the Long Bow Group, is a small non-profit company based in the Boston area. According to Gordon, \"One of the reasons we wanted to make [The Gate of Heavenly Peace] was to give more depth to [the 1989] movement and not just show the final, violent conclusion, which is where people tend to focus.”[3] Despite the hundreds of hours of Western media coverage, Hinton felt that \"everything was reduced to slogans and hand clapping. I wanted to hear more Chinese voices, because I knew they would show a range of opinion. We felt a film that did that could help open up people's minds about these events. It's not all black and white.\"[3] In addition to Hinton and Gordon, China scholars such as Geremie Barmé, Gail Hershatter, and Jeffrey Wasserstrom helped to provide context and perspective. Over three hundred hours of archival footage were collected, and the film took over five years to complete. Says Hinton, \"It was not an easy decision to get into something like this. I knew that any documentary – to say nothing of something of this scale, between the funding and the research and the actual making of the film – would probably take years of our lives. Once we decided to make the film, it did take nearly six years.\"[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Richard Gordon Carma Hinton","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Deborah Amos","m_music_by":"Mark Pevsner","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"1995","m_running_time":"180 min","m_country":" United States","m_language":"English Mandarin | The Gate of Heavenly Peace (Chinese: 天安门; pinyin: Tiānānmén) is a 1995 documentary film, produced by Richard Gordon and Carma Hinton, about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ “Assessing Both Sides in Tiananmen Square Massacre,” Stephen Holden, The New York Times, October 14, 1995 | ^ Pauline Chen, “Screening History: New Documentaries on the Tiananmen Events in China,” Cineaste, vol. 22, no. 1 (Winter, 1996) | ^ a b “Tiananmen Square Story on Film,” Paul Desruisseaux, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Oct. 27, 1995 | ^ “Squaring Off Over Tiananmen Square,” Jerry White, The Independent, January–February 1996 | ^ \"6 Years After the Tiananmen Massacre, Survivors Clash Anew on Tactics,\" Patrick E.
