Main characters are a student, who is home in a very small outpost in the desert for a visit, an electrician and his child apprentice, and the local women. The film is characterized by a succession of images of the daily life of the characters which seem unique to their particular setting. The viewer must interpret the scenes without much help from narrator or plot. The film is thus a solitary experience of moments of beauty, struggle, alienation, and humor. It premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section.[1]","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Festival de Cannes: Waiting for Happiness\". festival-cannes.com.
