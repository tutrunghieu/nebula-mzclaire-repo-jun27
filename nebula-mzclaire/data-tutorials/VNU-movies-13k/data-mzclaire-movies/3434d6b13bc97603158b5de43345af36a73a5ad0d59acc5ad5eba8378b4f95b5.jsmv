{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The story starts in a forest called Holiday Woods with seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays: Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Halloween and Independence Day. Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington, a skeleton known as The Pumpkin King, leads them in organizing the annual Halloween holiday. However, in a monologue, Jack reveals he has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something more. Wandering dejectedly in the woods, he stumbles across the seven holiday doors and accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town, whose residents are charged with organizing the annual Christmas holiday. Impressed by the bright and cheery feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of Christmas, to the Halloween Town residents. However, they fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween, although there is one Christmas character they can relate to: the fearsome lobster-like king of Christmas Town who flies at night, named \"Sandy Claws\". Jack is dismayed that no one understands the feeling of Christmas, obsessively tries to study the holiday but fails to grasp any further explanation of it. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the feeling and there's no reason why he shouldn't be able to, and announces that the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year. | Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of Santa. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman created by the town's mad scientist, starts falling in love with Jack. However, after a vision of a burning Christmas tree, she alone realizes that his plans to run Christmas will become disastrous, but has no luck convincing him. Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town. Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. | Christmas Eve arrives and Sally attempts to stop Jack with fog, but fails to do so thanks to Jack's ghost dog Zero and his glowing nose allowing Jack to embark into the sky on a coffin-like sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, guided by Zero. Down on the ground, Sally prays that her premonition does not come true. Jack begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts (shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, pumpkin jack-in-the-boxes, vampire teddy bears, toy ducks with sharp teeth, man-eating wreaths, bats, etc.) only terrify the recipients. The children alert their parents, who call the police, who call the military. The air raid siren is activated, and Jack is spotted with search lights, after which he is then shot at by air raid artillery cannons. Initially mistaking the firing for a celebration, he simply flies higher. However, after a reindeer is hit, and his sleigh is grazed, he realizes that he is being targeted, but the next cannon destroys the sleigh, and Jack falls from the sky to Earth, devastating Halloween Town's citizens. Thought to have been dead by the attack, Jack crash-lands in a cemetery unharmed. Although he is depressed by the failure of his plan, he quickly regains his old spirit, having come up with new ideas for next Halloween. He then rushes back home to rescue Santa and put things right. | Meanwhile, Sally attempts to free Santa, but is captured by Oogie. Jack slips into the lair and frees them, then angrily confronts Oogie. Almost immediately, Oogie springs several traps on Jack, who manages to dodge them, and Oogie attempts to flee. However, Jack pulls one of Oogie's loose threads, revealing him to be nothing more than a collection of snakes and insects, which are all incinerated, save for the last one, which Santa squashes with his boot. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions, and Santa, while still annoyed with Jack for attempting to take over his job, assures him that he can fix things, and leaves to get rid of the evil toys and deliver the right presents to the world's children. | After Jack returns to Halloween Town, the townspeople celebrate that he's alive, and Santa, after fixing Christmas, returns and makes snow fall over Halloween Town in reconciliation between himself and Jack. The townspeople are confused by the snow at first, but soon begin to play happily in it, finally realizing what Christmas is about. Jack spies Sally heading to the graveyard, and follows her. Atop the graveyard's big hill, Jack admits that he reciprocates Sally's romantic feelings for him, and they declare their new found love, and kiss on the hill.","m_cast":"Chris Sarandon (spoken) and Danny Elfman (singing) as Jack Skellington: A skeleton known as the \"Pumpkin King\" of Halloween Town.

While not used in the final film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album.","m_reception":"The film initially received positive reviews from critics; it has since gone on to receive widespread critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 94%, based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.\"[35] On Metacritic the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[36] | Roger Ebert gave a highly positive review for Nightmare. Ebert believed the film's visual effects were as revolutionary as Star Wars, taking into account that Nightmare was \"filled with imagination that carries us into a new world\".[37] | Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of \"originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. ... It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.\"[38] James Berardinelli stated \"The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain.\"[39] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed stylistic features in common with Oscar Wilde, German Expressionism, the Brothers Grimm and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.[40] | Michael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch's dog.[41] Philip Nel writes that the film \"challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters\", contrasting Jack as a \"good trickster\" with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Dr. Seuss' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster.[42] Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose \"degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that ... they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on.\"[43] This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan.[44] | Yvonne Tasker notes \"the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas\".[45] Most recently, the film ranked #1 on Rotten Tomatoes' \"Top 25 Best Christmas Movies\" list.[46] | Danny Elfman was worried the characterization of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).[47] Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character was inspired by the Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. \"Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus,\" Selick continued. \"I think those are some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it\".[16] | Nightmare has inspired video game spin-offs, including Oogie's Revenge and The Pumpkin King, and is among the many Disney-owned franchises that contribute to the mythology of the Kingdom Hearts series. A trading card game is also available. Since 2001, Disneyland has held a Nightmare Before Christmas theme for its Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction. | Around the release of the film, Disney executive David Hoberman was quoted, \"I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us.\"[8] Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before being wide released on October 29. The film earned $50 million in the United States on its first theatrical run.[48] | On October 20, 2006, Walt Disney Pictures reissued Nightmare (no longer under Touchstone) with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D. Industrial Light & Magic assisted in the process.[14] It made a further $8.7 million in box office gross.[49] Subsequently, the 3-D version of Nightmare has been re-released annually in October.[48] The 2007 and 2008 reissues earned $14.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, increasing the film's total box office gross to $75 million.[48] The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010.[50] The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema.[51][52] | The film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[53][54] Nightmare won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, while Elfman won Best Music. Selick and the animators were also nominated for their work.[55] Elfman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.[56] | The American Film Institute nominated The Nightmare Before Christmas for its Top 10 Animated Films list.[57]","m_production":"As writer Tim Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, [...] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before\", Burton would later recall.[4] After completing his short film Vincent in 1982,[4] then-Disney animator Burton wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas.[5] Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price,[6] but also considered other options such as a children's book.[7] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models;[8][9] Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time.[10] After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special.[8] However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \"too weird\" to the company.[11] As Disney was unable to \"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984,[6] and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman.[11] | Over the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director.[10] Disney was looking forward to Nightmare \"to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\"[12] Nightmare marked Burton's third film in a row to have a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns and he did not want to be involved with \"the painstakingly slow process of stop motion\".[10] To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs,[1] while Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming.[10][13] Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation.[14] At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming.[15] In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the movie. | Elfman found writing Nightmare's 11 songs as \"one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington.\"[8] Caroline Thompson still had yet to be hired to write the screenplay.[1] With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, \"there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, reconfiguring and developing the film visually.\"[16] The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book.[8][16] In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\"[17] | On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \"It's as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films.\"[16] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, \"I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\"[16] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation.[10] Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.[1] | The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \"around four hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.[18] Sally's mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, [...] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronised mouth movements.\"[19] | The stop motion figurine of Jack Skellington was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack. | The owners of the franchise have undertaken an extensive marketing campaign of these characters across many media. In addition to the Haunted Mansion Holiday at Disneyland featuring the film's characters,[20] Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into Bendies figures,[21] while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art.[22] Moreover, Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume.[23] A Jack Skellington figurine is available for the Disney Infinity video game, allowing the character to be playable in the game's \"Toy Box Mode\".[24] Jack is also the titular character in the short story \"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Jack's Story\".[25] | Jim Edwards contends that \"Tim Burton's animated movie The Nightmare Before Christmas is really a movie about the marketing business. The movie's lead character, Jack Skellington, the chief marketing officer (CMO) for a successful company, decides that his success is boring and he wants the company to have a different business plan.\"[26]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Story and Characters by Tim Burton","m_directed_by":"Henry Selick","m_produced_by":"Tim Burton Denise Di Novi","m_screenplay_by":"Caroline Thompson","m_story_by":"Michael McDowell (adaptation)","m_starring":"Chris Sarandon Danny Elfman Catherine O'Hara William Hickey Glenn Shadix Ken Page","m_music_by":"Danny Elfman","m_cinematography":"Pete Kozachik","m_edited_by":"Stan Webb","m_production_company":"Touchstone Pictures1 Skellington Productions","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 29, 1993 (1993-10-29) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"76 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$18 million[1]","m_box_office":"$75.1 million (North America)[2] | The Nightmare Before Christmas, often promoted as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, is a 1993 American stop motion dark fantasy musical film directed by Henry Selick, and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, a character from \"Halloween Town\" who stumbles through a portal to \"Christmas Town\" and decides to celebrate the holiday, with some dastardly and comical consequences. Danny Elfman wrote the film score and voiced the singing role of Jack. The principal voice cast also includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens and Glenn Shadix. | The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Disney. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco. Disney released the film through the Touchstone Pictures banner because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark, and scary for kids.\"[3] | The Nightmare Before Christmas was met with both critical and financial success. The film has since been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and re-released annually in the Disney Digital 3-D format from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3D. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d e Mark Salisbury, Tim Burton (2006).
