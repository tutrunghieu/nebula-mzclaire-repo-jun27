It was the film editor Hayers' first film as director. It also marked the debut of Moira Redmond.[2] It was released in the United States as Rebound. | The film is based on a story by Roy Vickers, from his 'Department of Dead Ends' series, originally published from 1934. These stories were ‘inverted’ mysteries: the reader knows the identity of the criminal, but the interest lies in how the detective solves the case and featured detectives dusting off cold cases. As with many of the criminals in Vickers’ stories, the protagonist Doug, is sympathetically depicted.[3][4] |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Violent Moment (1958)\".
