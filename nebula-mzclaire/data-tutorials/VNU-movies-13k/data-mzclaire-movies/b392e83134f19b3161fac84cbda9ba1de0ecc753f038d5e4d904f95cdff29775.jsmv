{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the 1940s Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein is a freelance crime and street photographer for the New York City tabloids, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his unique ability to capture shots that nobody else can. He is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, \"Nobody does what I do. Nobody\". | With a police radio under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift darkroom in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs. He is so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the \"Great Bernzini\". | Bernzy meets a sultry widow, Kay Levitz (Barbara Hershey), who owns a fancy nightclub. It seems the mob is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband. Kay asks if Bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome. Generally unsuccessful with women, Bernzy agrees to help Kay, and he slowly begins to fall in love with her. | After talking to his contacts, including journalist friend Arthur Nabler (Jerry Adler), he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him murdered. But when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect in the man's death. The police and the FBI are also very interested in this case. Bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, Sal (Stanley Tucci), uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal gas rationing, and the Federal government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an Italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.","m_cast":"Joe Pesci as Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein | Barbara Hershey as Kay Levitz | Stanley Tucci as Sal | Jerry Adler as Arthur Nabler | Dominic Chianese as Spoleto | Richard Riehle as Officer O'Brien | Max Brooks as Teen at Thompson Street | Richard Schiff as Thompson Street Photographer | Christian Stolte as Ambulance Attendant | Jack Denbo as Photo Editor | Timothy Hendrickson as Richard Rineman | Del Close as H.R. Rineman | Lisa Parthenakis - as young bride with soldier husband","m_reception":"Chicago Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert, was especially complimentary of the film and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, \"One of the best things about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly Speed Graphic with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, he stares death in the face to get a great picture.\"[6] Ebert said the film made him \"think\" a little bit of Casablanca (1942). | Time Out magazine liked the acting and the script, and wrote, \"The main virtue of screenwriter Franklin's debut as director is Pesci's portrayal of Weegee, the famous low-life tabloid photographer of urban disaster, lightly concealed as Bernstein, 'The Great Bernzini'... good dialogue, nice period recreation, great performances.\"[7] | Desson Howe, film critic for The Washington Post wrote, \"Public wants to be taken for an atmospheric film noir, full of intrigue, romance and street toughness. But it's all flash and no picture. Despite the usual quippy, perky performance from Pesci, as well as cinematographer Peter Suschitzky's moodily delineated images, the movie is superficial and unengaging. It's as if Life magazine decided to make an oldtime gangster movie.\"[8]","m_production":"Joe Pesci took this role right after his Oscar-winning performance in Goodfellas. It was an attempt to capitalize on his popularity at the time and help elevate Pesci from respected character actor to star status. | Director and writer Howard Franklin was unable to secure the rights to Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig's story. Franklin, then, wrote the story of a Weegee-like photographer who smokes cigars and he named him Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein. In the film, like Weegee, cops wonder if Bernzy uses a ouija board to snap his photographs and find the stories.[1] | According to journalist Doug Trapp, Franklin was inspired to write the screenplay after seeing a show of Fellig's photos in the 1980s at the International Center of Photography in New York City. And Weegee did, in real life, have a \"soul-mate\" named Wilma Wilcox, who was the woman in charge of his estate. But, Franklin has always denied that the film was about their relationship.[2] | Even though the film takes place in Manhattan, it was shot in Chicago, Illinois, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Howard Franklin","m_produced_by":"Sue Baden-Powell","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Joe Pesci Barbara Hershey","m_music_by":"Mark Isham","m_cinematography":"Peter Suschitzky","m_edited_by":"Evan A.
