{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Shiang-chyi has returned to Taipei from her trip to Paris. She goes to the skywalk where she first met Hsiao-kang, the salesman who sold her a watch, but some construction has taken place and the skywalk is gone. She stares at a large video screen for a while and then wanders around aimlessly. After crossing a street illegally, she is stopped by a police officer, who checks her ID card. Shiang-chyi then stops at a coffee shop for a short while. She realizes that her card is missing, so she goes back to the officer to ask if he still has it. He replies that he does not. | Meanwhile, Hsiao-kang is smoking in a public bathroom stall. After he finishes, he washes his hands and leaves the restroom. He then walks up some stairs on the underpass. Shiang-chyi is walking down the same flight of stairs, and they pass each other. Hsiao-kang pauses at the top of the staircase to look back down at her, but Shiang-chyi does not notice him. | Hsiao-kang then goes to audition for a new job as a pornographic actor. The director asks him a few questions and then tells him to take off his clothes. Hsiao-kang hesitates but eventually complies. He then puts on a doctor's uniform and steps out onto the balcony to start filming. | The short ends with music playing over a scene of clouds moving in real-time.","m_cast":"Chen Shiang-chyi | Lee Kang-sheng | Lu Yi-ching","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tsai Ming-liang","m_produced_by":null,"m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Chen Shiang-chyi Lee Kang-sheng","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"October 8, 2002 (2002-10-08TCanada)","m_running_time":"25 minutes","m_country":"Taiwan","m_language":"Mandarin | The Skywalk is Gone (Mandarin name: Tianqiao bu jian le) is a 2002 Taiwanese short film directed by Tsai Ming-liang and starring Chen Shiang-chyi and Lee Kang-sheng. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d Hu, Brian. \"Goodbye City, Goodbye Cinema: Nostalgia in Tsai Ming-liang's The Skywalk is Gone\". sensesofcinema.com.
