{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film covers an academic year, beginning with the teachers gathering for the autumn term, introducing themselves to each other and being welcomed by the principal, an unsmiling figure wearing rimless glasses. It ends with an informal game of football between staff and pupils and a long hand-held shot of an empty classroom. | The camera never leaves the school. The film is set in the staff room, the playground, the dining room, the principal's office, a conference room, and the classroom where François Marin (François Bégaudeau) teaches French (i.e., language arts) to a mixed group of 13- and 14-year-olds. | The film centers around Marin and the various experiences he has with students in his French literature class. The class is difficult, as Marin is unable to relate to his students due to his ethnicity and class status . Marin makes various attempts to try and garner trust and respect from his students but fails miserably . At the students protest of their dislike of the required reading material Anne Frank due to lack of cultural relevance, Marin tries to gain insight into the lives of his pupils. He assigns them to write self-portraits which describe their aspirations, hobbies and dislikes. These are eventually collated by Marin who creates an end-of-year book with them. Most of his students respond positively to this assignment including Soulemayne, a student from Mali whom Marin allows to complete a photographic autobiography . However all this new found trust and respect that Marin gets from his students quickly dissipates after a faculty meeting in which two of his students are allowed to attend as class representatives . Marin would go on to make disparaging comments about one of his students in this meeting and even more disparaging remarks about the class representatives who would serve to be whistle blowers later on in the film . The film concludes with consequences of Marin's actions and failures that ultimately leave him unscathed and one of his students expelled . The film explores themes of colonialism, displacement, assimilation versus cultural pluralism and white privilege .","m_cast":"Burak Ozyilmaz as Burak | Boubacar Toure as Boubacar | Carl Nanor as Carl, a student who arrived during the year (after expulsion from another middle school) | Esmeralda Ouertani as Esmeralda, another class representative | Franck Keita as Souleymane, a student who enters the Disciplinary Board | François Bégaudeau as François Marin, a French teacher and form teacher | Jean-Michel Simonet as The headmaster | Louise Grinberg as Louise, the class representative, first class | Rachel Régulier as Khoumba, a student who refuses to read | Vincent Robert as Hervé, the sports teacher.","m_reception":"The film has received critical acclaim, achieving a 96% rating at Rotten Tomatoes out of 150 reviews counted.

Laurent Cantet, whose parents were both teachers, carries it on and he elicits marvellous performances...As the teacher at a tough, racially mixed, inner-city school in Paris, Marin (François Bégaudeau), neither weary cynic nor wide-eyed idealist, is a decent, determined realist..not a saint, though by the end of the school year he has exhibited certain of the necessary qualities.\"[7] | The film was the featured 'opening night' selection at the 46th New York Film Festival in 2008. | The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.[8] | 2nd - Dana Stevens, Slate[8] | 2nd - Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times (tied with A Christmas Tale)[8] | 2nd - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune[8] | 2nd - Peter Rainer, The Christian Science Monitor[8] | 3rd - David Denby, The New Yorker[8] | 5th - David Edelstein, New York magazine[8] | 5th - Dennis Harvey, Variety[8] | 5th - Ella Taylor, LA Weekly (tied with A Christmas Tale)[8] | 5th - Stephanie Zacharek, Salon[8] | 7th - Andrea Gronvall, Chicago Reader[8] | 7th - Robert Mondello, NPR[8] | 8th - Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly[8] | 8th - Sean Axmaker, Seattle Post-Intelligencer[8]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Entre les murs by François Bégaudeau","m_directed_by":"Laurent Cantet","m_produced_by":"Caroline Benjo Carole Scotta","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"François Bégaudeau","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Pierre Milon","m_edited_by":"Robin Campillo","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Haut et Court","m_release_dates":"24 May 2008 (2008-05-24) (Cannes) | 24 September 2008 (2008-09-24) (France) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"128 minutes","m_country":"France","m_language":"French","m_budget":"€2.5 million[1]","m_box_office":"$28.7 million[1] | The Class is a 2008 French drama film directed by Laurent Cantet.
