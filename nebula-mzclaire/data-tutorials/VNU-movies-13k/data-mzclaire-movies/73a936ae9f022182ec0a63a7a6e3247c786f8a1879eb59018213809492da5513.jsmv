{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":null,"m_cast":"The following is a list of cast members who voiced or portrayed characters appearing in The Hobbit films. | In early October 2010, it was confirmed by the studio that Martin Freeman had officially been cast in the role of Bilbo Baggins. It was revealed that he had earlier been approached by the producers to play a role in the films, but was forced to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts with the BBC television series Sherlock. At the time, Freeman was quoted as saying, \"[I]f something could be worked out, that would be great. I did it [turned down the role] with a heavy heart, definitely.\"[90] On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, \"Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when you come across an actor who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to announce that he is our Hobbit.\"[91] | Later in October, it was revealed that several other cast members had joined the project, including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as Glóin. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, \"Richard is one of the most exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands.\"[91] McTavish was quoted on his casting, \"I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable.\"[92] Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, \"Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli.\"[93][94] On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, \"I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects [Meet the Feebles and King Kong]; he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [him] on these movies.\"[93][94] Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. On his casting Callen stated, \"I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. Given that Óin is almost 200 years old I can presume only that it was the age.\"[95] On being cast in the role, Hunter said, \"Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way back when I signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'\"[96] | On 1 November 2010, Jackson confirmed that James Nesbitt and Adam Brown had been added to the cast to play Bofur and Ori respectively.[97] It was previously reported that Nesbitt was in negotiations for a part in the film.[98] Jackson was quoted on Nesbitt's casting as saying, \"James's charm, warmth and wit are legendary as is his range as an actor in both comedic and dramatic roles. We feel very lucky to be able to welcome him as one of our cast.\"[97] Nesbitt's daughters also appear in the film series as Sigrid and Tilda, the daughters of Bard the Bowman.[89] Commenting on Brown's casting, Jackson was quoted as saying, \"Adam is a wonderfully expressive actor and has a unique screen presence. I look forward to seeing him bring Ori to life.\"[97] The role also marked Brown's first film appearance.[99] | On 7 December 2010, it was revealed that several other cast members had joined the project, including Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Sylvester McCoy as Radagast the Brown, Mikael Persbrandt as Beorn, William Kircher as Bifur, Ken Stott as Balin and Jed Brophy as Nori.[100] Blanchett was the first returning cast member from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy to be cast in the films, even though her character does not appear in the novel. On her casting, Jackson said, \"Cate is one of my favorite actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films.\"[100] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a \"wizard\" in October 2010,[101] leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown.[102] During the production of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, McCoy had been contacted about playing the role of Bilbo and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Ian Holm.[103] On the casting of Persbrandt, Jackson was quoted as saying, \"The role of Beorn is an iconic one and Mikael was our first choice for the part. Since seeing him read for the role we can't imagine anyone else playing this character.\"[100] On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented \"Fran and I have long been fans of Ken's work and are excited he will be joining us on this journey.\"[100] The casting of Brophy came after his collaboration with Jackson on several films, including Braindead, Heavenly Creatures, and all three Lord of the Rings films as various creatures. | On 7 January 2011, TheOneRing.net confirmed that Elijah Wood had joined the cast to reprise his role of Frodo Baggins in the project. As Frodo hadn't been born during the events of The Hobbit, the inclusion of Frodo indicated that parts of the story would take place shortly before or during the events of The Lord of the Rings. According to TheOneRing.net, \"As readers of 'The Hobbit' know, the tale of 'The Downfall of The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit or There and Back Again,' are contained in the fictional 'Red Book of Westmarch.' In Peter Jackson's LOTR films, the book is shown on screen and written in by Bilbo and Frodo and handed off to Samwise Gamgee....The fictional book and either the telling from it or the reading of it, will establish Frodo in the film experiencing Bilbo's story. Viewers are to learn the tale of 'The Hobbit' as a familiar Frodo gets the tale as well.\"[104] | On 10 January 2011, it was confirmed that Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis would reprise their respective roles of Gandalf the Grey and Gollum from the The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.[105] Although both actors were expected to return for their roles McKellen was previously quoted in July 2010 on TVNZ's Good Morning that: \"I'm not under contract and my time is running out. I don't want to give the producers the impression that I'm sitting waiting.\"[106] It was later revealed that Serkis would also serve as second unit director on the films.[107] Serkis stated, \"I think I understand Peter's sensibility and we have a common history of understanding Middle-earth. A lot of the crew from The Lord of the Rings was returning to work on The Hobbit. There is really a sense of Peter wanting people around him who totally understand the material and the work ethic.\"[107] | On 11 January 2011, it was confirmed that Christopher Lee would reprise his role as Saruman the White.[108] Lee had originally said he would have liked to have shown how Saruman is first corrupted by Sauron,[109] but would not be comfortable flying to New Zealand at his age.[110] Lee went on to say that if a film were made, he would love to voice Smaug, as it would mean he could record his part in England and not have to travel.[111] On 10 January 2011, it was reported that Lee had entered into negotiations to reprise the role of Saruman.[112] | On 21 March 2011, Jeffrey Thomas joined the project as the character of Thrór, as did Mike Mizrahi as Thráin II.[113] | On 4 April 2011, Bret McKenzie was added to the cast as Lindir.[114] His father Peter McKenzie played the role of Elendil in The Lord of the Rings. | On 22 April 2011, Jackson confirmed via Facebook that Ian Holm had been added to the cast as old Bilbo Baggins.[115] During the early stages of pre-production, former director Guillermo del Toro indicated that he was interested in having Holm reprise the role of Bilbo, but acknowledged that he might be too old to take on such a physically demanding role. On his potential casting, del Toro stated, \"[Holm] certainly is the paragon we aspire to. He will be involved in some manner, I'm sure.\"[41] He also indicated that he was open to the possibility of Holm narrating the films.[39] On 10 January 2011, Deadline Hollywood reported that Holm had entered into negotiations to play the older Bilbo.[112] On 3 March 2011, Holm revealed that he had been in talks with the producers about reprising the role, but that he had not heard back from them yet.[116] | In the early stages of production, the role of Thranduil had been linked to actor Doug Jones but on 29 April 2011, Jackson reported on Facebook that the role had gone to Lee Pace. On his casting, Jackson said, \"Casting these Tolkien stories is very difficult, especially the Elven characters and Lee has always been our first choice for Thranduil. He's going to be great. We loved his performance in a movie called The Fall a few years ago and have been hoping to work with him since. When we were first discussing who would be right for Thranduil, Lee came into mind almost immediately.\"[117][118] | On 30 April 2011, Jackson announced that Dean O'Gorman had been hired for the role of Fíli.[117] Jackson stated, \"Dean's a terrific Kiwi actor, who I am thrilled to be working with.\"[117] O'Gorman was a last minute replacement for Rob Kazinsky had originally been cast for the role in October 2010,[93] but left the film on 24 April 2011 \"for personal reasons\".[119] | Hugo Weaving's return to the role of Elrond was officially confirmed on 1 May 2011.[120] | On 19 May 2011, Stephen Fry and Ryan Gage were confirmed to join the project as Master of Lake-town and Alfrid respectively.[121] Fry spoke of his role, saying \"My character is an opportunity for sheer grossness... [Peter Jackson] had me eating testicles... gross appetites. I mustn't give too much away but I've got a bald cap and then on top of that a really bad combover wig and this wispy mustache and wispy beard and horrible blotchy skin and disgusting fingernails... And generally speaking a really unappetising piece of work. And a coward to boot and very, very greedy.\"[122] Gage was originally cast to play Drogo Baggins in December 2010, though according to Jackson, \"Ryan is a great young actor who we originally cast in a small role, but we liked him so much, we promoted him to the much larger Alfrid part\". | On 27 May 2011, Peter Jackson announced via Facebook that Orlando Bloom would reprise his role as Legolas.[123] Bloom revealed on 25 April 2011 that he had been in contact with Jackson, who had given him a copy of the screenplay and said that there was a high probability that he would return. He was quoted as saying, \"I'm going to bet on it... But I can't really talk too much about it because it's still sort of in the ether. But I would love to go back to work with Peter Jackson. It would be an honour.\"[124] | 19 June 2011, it was revealed that several other cast members had joined the project, including Luke Evans in the role of Bard the Bowman, Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, Barry Humphries as the Great Goblin and Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug and The Necromancer.[125] Cumberbatch portrayed both of his roles through motion capture, as did Humphries for his character.[126] The casting of Cumberbatch was prematurely revealed by his Sherlock co-star Martin Freeman during the BAFTA Television Awards in May 2011. Speculations of his undisclosed role were further fuelled when Ian McKellen wrote on his blog that Philippa Boyens showed him Cumberbatch's screen test, stating that it was \"electrifying, vocally and facially\".[127] Peter Jackson finally revealed on his Facebook page that Cumberbatch was set to play Smaug. Following this, it was also confirmed that he would be portraying The Necromancer as well.[128] | Billy Connolly joined the cast as Dáin II Ironfoot on 9 February 2012.[129] Connolly said of his character \"...this guy will terrify the life out of you. I have a mohawk and tattoos on my head.\"[130] | In addition, John Bell plays Bain,[131][132] Manu Bennett plays Azog,[133] Craig Hall plays Galion,[134] Ben Mitchell plays Narzug,[134] John Rawls plays Yazneg,[135] Stephen Ure plays Fimbul and Grinnah, Kiran Shah plays a goblin scribe,[136] and Stephen Colbert was cast in an undisclosed cameo.[137]Conan Stevens was to play Bolg,[138] but he eventually played a Gundabad Orc, also known as Keeper of Dungeons.","m_reception":"An Unexpected Journey has won the \"Technical Achievement\" award by the Houston Film Critics Society, who also nominated it for \"Best Original Song\", the award for \"Outstanding Virtual Cinematography\" by the Visual Effects Society, and the Empire Awards for \"Best Actor\" and \"Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy\".[214][215][216][217] Among others, the film has also received three Academy Award nominations, a nomination from the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association, four nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, six nominations from the Visual Effects Society, and three nominations from the Phoenix Film Critics Society.[218][219][220][215][221][222] | An Unexpected Journey — Nominations: 3; 1 award (non-competitive) | The Desolation of Smaug — Nominations: 3 | The Battle of the Five Armies - Nominations: 1 | At an industry event screening in April 2012, Peter Jackson showed a ten-minute clip of the film, and the new High Frame Rate 48 fps format received \"an underwhelming reaction at best\",[224] while Variety stated that the footage \"looked distinctively sharper and more immediate than everything shown before it, giving the 3D smoother movement and crisp sharpness\". It also reported that it lost \"the cinematic glow of the industry-standard 24 fps\" and that \"human actors seemed overlit and amplified in a way that many compared to modern sports broadcasts... and daytime television\".[225] One projectionist complained that \"it looked like a made-for-TV movie\".[226] | Peter Jackson claimed that the poor reception \"wasn't particularly surprising\" because \"it does take you a while to get used to it. Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more\".[227] However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as \"hyper-real,\" clear enough to detect \"painted sets\" and \"prosthetic noses\".[228][229] Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just takes a while to get used to – still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like \"actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie\".[230] | The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was also released in the current 24 fps standard in many theatres, some of which had not yet switched from film to digital projection.[231] | On 6 October 2011, Warner Bros. Consumer Products and U.S. toy company The Bridge Direct announced their partnership on worldwide master toy rights for The Hobbit films.[232] The toy line will include action figures, playsets and role-play accessories like swords and battle axes representing the characters and weapons in the films.[233][234] | The first wave of toy products hit store shelves in October 2012, ahead of the release of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. U.S. retailers that carry the toy line include Toys \"R\" Us, Kmart, and Walmart. Games Workshop released miniatures from The Hobbit as part of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game. The company has had rights to produce miniatures from the original book for some years but has not released any lines, save for a stand-alone game based on the Battle of Five Armies, with original designs not related to The Lord of the Rings films.[235] | While a number of companies were vying for The Hobbit deal, Warner Bros. Consumer Products awarded the license to Bridge Direct partly because some of its execs and staffers had worked on The Lord of the Rings toy line during their tenure at other toy companies, including Toy Biz and Play Along. The Bridge Direct, run by toy business veteran Jay Foreman, is best known for toys such as Inkoos activity plush, and the Zhu Zhu Pets plush line. | On 16 December 2011, Warner Bros. Consumer Products and Lego announced the development of figures and play sets based on the upcoming adaptations of The Hobbit as well as The Lord of the Rings. The launch of the Lego The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released to coincide with the release of the film adaptation's first part in December 2012.[236] | Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment now has the rights to develop a video game based on The Hobbit following the expiration in 2008 of Electronic Arts' license to The Lord of the Rings.[237] When Guillermo del Toro was set to direct he had stated that a video game, if it were to be made, would not be released to tie-in with The Hobbit film, but rather after their release. Del Toro had stated that while he would like to be involved in the video game's creation, making it at the same time as the film would complicate things due to a \"tight schedule\".[238] In October 2011, Warner Bros. confirmed that a Hobbit video game would be released in 2012, before the first film's release.[239] However, the studio did not confirm whether or not the game would be a tie-in with the film.[240] | Warner Brothers developed two free-to-play online strategy games in collaboration with Kabam for promoting the film series which were The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle Earth released for Android and iOS on 8 November 2012 and The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age playable online on web browsers and as a Facebook app that was released on 21 March 2013.[241][242][243] | Monolith Productions developed Guardians of Middle-earth,[244] which was released on 4 December 2012 for PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, and 5 December 2012 for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. Guardians of Middle-earth delivers a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game set in Middle-earth and crafted specifically for the console systems.

The game was released 8 April 2014.[245] | Two video games were developed to coincide with the film's theatrical release. | A tie-in fighting video game was released simultaneously with the film for Android and iOS platforms to negative reviews from critics and users. | Shadow of Mordor was a critically acclaimed Action-adventure video game released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 & Xbox One in October 2014 and for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 on 21 November, nearly a week prior to The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies world premiere in London, on 1 December.

They are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. Together they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. The films are subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).[4] | The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his ancestors. | The films feature an ensemble cast that also includes James Nesbitt, Ken Stott, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace and Luke Evans, with several actors reprising their roles from The Lord of the Rings, including Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis. The films also feature Manu Bennett, Sylvester McCoy, Stephen Fry, Mikael Persbrandt, Barry Humphries, and Lawrence Makoare. Also returning for production, among others, were illustrators John Howe and Alan Lee, art director Dan Hennah, cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, and composer Howard Shore, while props were again crafted by Weta Workshop, with visual effects managed by Weta Digital. | The first film in the series premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on Courtenay Place, and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and streamed over the Internet. The second film of the series premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at Leicester Square in London on 1 December 2014.[5] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Pip Bulbeck (21 October 2014). \"'Hobbit' Trilogy Reportedly Cost $745 Million to Make\".
