Reviews were predominantly negative, with TV Guide's stating, \"'The Scout' feels like a classic case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.\"[3] Variety also negatively reviewed the film, saying that Brooks and Ritchie \"never quite commit to either of the movie's disparate chords -- bailing out of the batter's box in terms of the psychological drama and, after some amusing moments at the outset, generally steering clear of broad comedy.\"[4] Time magazine's Richard Schickel praised the film, writing, \"The Scout is the best comedy-fantasy about baseball ever made, which goes to show that if Hollywood keeps trying, eventually someone will get it right.\" [5]","m_production":"In a July 1999 interview with Gavin Smith in Film Comment, Brooks said that The Scout was originally intended for Rodney Dangerfield. \"It was lying around, never going to get made, and I said I would like to do that.\" | Brooks said that he contributed to a rewrite of the script because \"it was written very silly.\" The version he worked on, he said, \"did not end like 'Rocky' with that bullshit big ending.\" But according to Brooks, the studio forced Ritchie to change the ending.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Ritchie","m_produced_by":"Andre Morgan Albert S.
