{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Following The Raid, the film opens with Bejo, a self-made Jakarta gang lord, executing Rama's brother Andi in a field outside the city. | After the disastrous raid on crime boss Tama's apartment building, Rama meets with Bunawar, a police officer deemed honest by Andi. After executing Wahyu and sending Rama's fellow survivor Bowo to receive medical attention, Bunawar invites Rama to join a clandestine anti-corruption task force. This undercover unit seeks to expose the backroom dealings of Reza and other police leaders with the Bangun and Goto crime families. While Rama initially declines, he agrees to join after learning of his brother's murder and the threat made by Bejo. Bunawar fakes Rama's death to protect his family from Reza and the corrupt cops, assigning Rama to infiltrate the crime world by befriending Uco, son of Bangun and heir to his criminal empire. | Uco is currently incarcerated; to reach him, Rama takes on the alias Yuda, assaults the son of a politician who opposes Bangun, and goes to prison. Soon after, several assailants led by a man named Beni start a prison riot and attempt to kill Uco in the chaos. Rama saves Uco from Beni during the riot; when Yuda leaves prison two years later, Bangun hires him as thanks. As Yuda, Rama proves his value to the crime family, earning their trust through his work under Bangun's consigliere Eka. Despite their power, Bangun's gang is revealed to suffer from hidden faults: Uco is hotheaded and resentful of his father, elite assassin Prakoso is estranged from his wife and son, and Bangun lives an isolated life with only Eka for counsel. Meanwhile, Rama begins to distrust and resent Bunawar, who endangers Rama by withholding information and micromanaging. While Rama succeeds in growing close to Bangun and planting a bug in Uco's wallet, he becomes frustrated with the anxiety of undercover work and his longing for his wife and son. | Capitalizing on Uco's angst, Bejo invites him to dinner at Bejo's restaurant. Sharing rumours of a Japanese plot to turn Reza against Bangun and overthrow Goto, Bejo also lets Uco personally kill his assailants from the riot; in the process, Uco notices a distinctive gang tattoo on Beni's wrist before killing Beni himself. The duo hatch a plot to start a gang war, which would let Uco prove himself to Bangun and help Bejo profit from the chaos. Uco lures Prakoso into an ambush by Bejo's gang, then lies to his father that the Japanese were responsible for Prakoso's death. Bejo's elite killers - deaf-mute Hammer Girl, her brother Baseball Bat Man, and the Assassin - kill dozens of Goto's subordinates the next day, creating the false appearance of reprisal by Bangun. In the course of the escalating conflict, Rama is attacked. He defeats a horde of assailants only to discover police IDs on their corpses after the fact. When the families meet to reconcile, Uco lashes out in anger, embarrassing Bangun into an important territory concession. Bangun beats Uco harshly on their return to the office. Shaken after killing other policemen, Rama contacts Bunawar and learns that he killed a team of Reza's corrupt cops sent to aid in the gang war. | Eka calls for Yuda to rescue Uco from Bangun's office. While Yuda is on the way, Bejo and the Assassin fight their way in with a mob of henchmen. After revealing his betrayal, Uco kills his father and shoots Eka in the leg. Before Bejo can finish him off, Yuda arrives, stalling while Eka flees. After the Assassin subdues Yuda, Bejo commands his men to kill him offsite. Eka follows, rescues Rama in a highway chase, and drives them to an abandoned scrapyard. Eka reveals that he knew Rama's identity and was also undercover. Voicing disillusionment with his work and his inability to change the harsh realities of crime in Jakarta, Eka counsels Rama that the only solution is to \"burn it all down\", telling him to exterminate the gangs before leaving the car and bleeding to death in the scrapyard. | Goto, hearing of Bangun's death and Reza's betrayal, becomes furious to learn of Bejo's coup against him, especially when Ryuichi (Goto's translator) reveals that Uco assisted Bejo into killing Bangun and turning Reza against him. Wanting to start over, Goto declares war against both Bejo and Reza. Elsewhere, Rama calls Bunawar, relaying news of Bejo's coup and learning that the gang war has dramatically escalated. Bunawar claims that Eka was a traitor that Bangun had turned, blaming Eka for their past difficulties infiltrating the gang. Rama learns that Reza, his true target, is meeting with Bejo and Uco at the restaurant. Rama breaches the restaurant warehouse and fights his way through Bejo's men. | While Uco and Bejo meet with Reza to discuss terms, Uco discovers the bug in his wallet. Uncertain who planted the bug, he later notices that Bejo has the same wrist tattoo as Beni, suggesting that the prison attack had been another attempt to spark the gang war. Realizing Bejo has been manipulating him all along, Uco comes to believe that Bejo planted the bug. Meanwhile, Rama fights and defeats Bejo's personal retinue of killers, takes the Assassin's kerambit, and disrupts the meeting. In the chaos, Uco kills Reza before betraying Bejo, who personally tried to kill Rama, by shooting him. Uco executes Bejo before turning his attentions to kill Rama, who has taken cover. | However, Rama surprises and overpowers Uco by stabbing him with the karambit. Uco dies in his arms, and Rama, wounded and exhausted, limps away. In the warehouse garage, he encounters Keiichi (Goto's son) and a mob of Goto's men, including Ryuichi, which was sent to eliminate both Bejo's gang and Reza's corrupt cops. While Bunawar learns of the night's events over his radio, Keiichi learns the same from Rama. In a silent dialogue, Keiichi asks Rama something, though whether it is a threat or an offer of employment is uncertain. The exchange ends with Rama stating, \"No...I'm done\".","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Following Merantau, director Gareth Evans and his producers began to work on a project called Berandal (which is Indonesian for \"thugs\"), a large-scale prison gang film intended to star not only Merantau actors Iko Uwais, Yayan Ruhian, and Donny Alamsyah, but also an additional pair of international fight stars. A teaser trailer was shot, but the project proved to be more complex and time consuming than they had anticipated.[8] After a year and a half, Evans and the producers found themselves with insufficient funds to produce Berandal, so they changed to a simpler, but different story with a smaller budget. They called the project Serbuan Maut (The Raid), which led to the creation of the first film.[9] | While developing The Raid in script form, Evans considered the idea of creating a link between it and the initial project, Berandal. Following the release of The Raid, it was later confirmed that Berandal would serve as a sequel to The Raid.[10][11] Evans also said that he wanted to include car chases in the sequel, as well as a third Raid film being \"a lot further down the line\".[12] | With the title for the North American market announced as The Raid 2, the sequel has a \"significantly larger\" budget than its predecessor, and its production schedule took approximately 100 days.[13] Pre-production began in September 2012 with filming in January 2013.[14][15] | In December 2012, it was announced that Julie Estelle was cast as \"Hammer Girl\"; Evans also tweeted that internationally renowned silat practitioner Cecep Arif Rahman was also given a major part in the film.[16] Marsha Timothy, Mathias Muchus, Tio Pakusadewo, and Alex Abbad, who worked with Evans in Merantau, were also cast in the film.[16] Japanese actors Matsuda Ryuhei, Endo Kenichi, and Kitamura Kazuki also joined the cast.[17] | Evans also revealed on his Twitter that Yayan Ruhian, who played Mad Dog in The Raid, will return for the sequel as a new character called Prakoso,[18] who is the machete-wielding chief assassin of Bangun. He claimed that he would not do a martial arts film without Ruhian being involved.[19] Ruhian, who is a choreographer of the film, also trained Estelle in pencak silat.[20] | In January 2013, PT Merantau Films and XYZ Films announced the start of production.[21][22][23] The filming process took about seven months and ended in July 2013.[24] | The film's lead cinematographer Matt Flannery tweeted that at least three RED cameras were used in a test shoot of a chase scene.[25][26] Gareth Evans mentioned on his Twitter that they were using RED Scarlet for 95% of the shoot, Epic for slow mo, and Go Pro 3 for quick cuts during the car chase.[27] | Sony Pictures Classics purchased the film for North American, Latin American, and Spanish markets; Alliance/Momentum for the United Kingdom and Canada; Koch Media for German-speaking territories; Korea Screen for the Korean market; and HGC for China.[28][29][30]","m_sequel":"On 6 January 2014, Total Film reported that The Raid 3 will take place two hours before the end of The Raid 2.[73] Also on 19 April 2014, during an interview with Metro, director Evans said that he is planning to take a break from martial arts movies for two or three years before filming it.[74][75][76] The Raid 3 is planned for 2018 or 2019.[77]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Gareth Evans","m_produced_by":"Ario Sagantoro | Nate Bolotin | Aram Tertzakian","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Iko Uwais | Arifin Putra | Oka Antara | Tio Pakusadewo | Alex Abbad | Julie Estelle | Ryuhei Matsuda | Kenichi Endo | Kazuki Kitamura","m_music_by":"Joseph Trapanese | Aria Prayogi | Fajar Yuskemal","m_cinematography":"Matt Flannery | Dimas Imam Subhono","m_edited_by":"Gareth Evans","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"SinemArt (Indonesia distribution) | Sony Pictures Classics (US distribution) | Stage 6 Films (US distribution)","m_release_dates":"21 January 2014 (2014-01-21) (Sundance) | 28 March 2014 (2014-03-28) (Indonesia) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"150 minutes[1]","m_country":"Indonesia","m_language":"Indonesian Japanese (some dialogue)","m_budget":"$4.5 million[2]","m_box_office":"$6.6 million[3] | The Raid 2 (Indonesian: The Raid 2: Berandal — English: \"Thug\")[4] is a 2014 Indonesian martial arts crime film written and directed by Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans; it is the sequel to the 2011 film The Raid. | The film was released on 28 March 2014.[5][6][7] It follows SWAT member Rama, the protagonist of the first film, as he is sent undercover to take down both corrupt police officials and the gangs of the criminal underworld.
