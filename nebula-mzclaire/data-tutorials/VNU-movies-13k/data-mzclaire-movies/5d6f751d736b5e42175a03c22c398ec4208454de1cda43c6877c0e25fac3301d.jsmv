Svensk Filmindustri offered Bergman to produce his next film. Thirst was based on a short story collection published by Birgit Tengroth in 1948; Herbert Grevenius, who had already worked with Bergman on It Rains on Our Love, wrote the screenplay. Bergman asked Tengroth to star in his film, who helped him in finding the right tone in the lesbian scene between Viola and Valborg. Shooting took place between 15 March and 5 July 1949.[1][2] Thirst premiered on 17 October 1949 in Sweden and on 30 August 1956 in the US.[3] | Swedish Critic Jörn Donner later called Thirst \"a commercial version of Prison\". François Truffaut saw similarities between Bergman's film and Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion and Rich and Strange.[2][1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Thirst  by Birgit Tengroth","m_directed_by":"Ingmar Bergman","m_produced_by":"Helge Hagerman","m_screenplay_by":"Herbert Grevenius","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Eva Henning Birger Malmsten Birgit Tengroth","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Gunnar Fischer","m_edited_by":"Oscar Rosander","m_production_company":"Svensk Filmindustri","m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"17 October 1949 (1949-10-17) (Sweden) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"83 minutes","m_country":"Sweden","m_language":"Swedish German | Thirst (Swedish: Törst) is a 1949 Swedish drama film directed by Ingmar Bergman.
