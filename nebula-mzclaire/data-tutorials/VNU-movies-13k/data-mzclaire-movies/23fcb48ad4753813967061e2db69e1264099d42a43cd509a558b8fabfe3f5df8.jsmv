{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"César Faz (Clifton Collins, Jr.), moves to Monterrey, Mexico after he is let go by the St. Louis Cardinals from his job as a clubhouse attendant. There he meets local children being led by Padre Esteban (Cheech Marin), enjoying baseball; he takes pitcher Ángel Macías (Jake T. Austin), under his wing and brags about his own pitching skills and how he used to coach the Cardinals. Ángel convinces César to help recruit and coach Monterrey's first-ever Little League team. With César's skills and Padre Esteban's support, the boys hone themselves into a competitive team worthy of international competition. At the final game of the World Series of Little League, Monterrey defeated the team of West La Mesa, California 4–0. Enrique Suárez (Jansen Panettiere), hit a grand slam home run, and Ángel Macías pitched a perfect game, a feat that has not since been repeated in Little League World Series history. | When the team arrives in the United States, they are met with racism, a language barrier, and visa troubles. Though the underdogs, the team scores a series of victories that endear them to the media, and new fans. They befriend a sports reporter, Frankie (Emilie de Ravin), and the groundskeeper, Cool Papa Bell (Louis Gossett, Jr.), who then assist the boys in reaching the final game.","m_cast":"Clifton Collins, Jr. as César Faz | Cheech Marin as Padre Esteban | Moisés Arias as Mario Ontiveros | Jake T.

Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said he felt that \"the film did a nice job of telling the story of the surprise upset when a youth ball team from Monterrey, Mexico, won the 1957 Little League World Series.\" He also commented that, \"although the story seems like a fable, it reflected true events.\" He further expressed concern over Lionsgate's suspending the original release date.[5] Ben Apatoff of MLB.com felt that the film was a strong family movie that appeals to baseball history buffs or any person who could relate to a child in love with the game.[1] Roger Ebert wrote: \"You sort of know how these underdog sports movies turn out. Doesn't matter. The Perfect Game so expertly uses the charisma and personalities of the actors, especially the young ones, that it's thrilling anyway.\"[6] | A. O. Scott of At the Movies said, \"[From] the second minute of the movie I knew every single thing that was going to happen and there was not a single surprise.\"[7] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \"The movie feels fradulent, whether it's sticking to the historical record or going its own way with the customary composites and revisions and fabrications.\"[8] The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 54% of critics have given The Perfect Game positive reviews, based upon a sample of 39.[9]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"William Dear","m_produced_by":"David Salzberg Christian Tureaud Jason French","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Clifton Collins Jr. Cheech Marin Moises Arias Jake T.
