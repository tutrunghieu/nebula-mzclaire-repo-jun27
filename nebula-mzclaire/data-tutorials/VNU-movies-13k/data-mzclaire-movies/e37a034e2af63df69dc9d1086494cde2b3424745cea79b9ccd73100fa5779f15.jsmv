{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"British Treasury secret agent Phillip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) is sent to investigate the hijacking of five cargo ships in the Irish Sea, tracking the latest hijacked ship—the Nantesville, carrying £8 million in gold bullion—to the Scottish Highlands and the sleepy port town of \"Torbay\" on the \"Isle of Torbay\" (patterned after Tobermory, on the Isle of Mull). | Posing as marine biologists, Calvert and his partner Hunslett (Corin Redgrave) find the local inhabitants suspicious and hostile. They suspect that Cypriot tycoon and shipping magnate Sir Anthony Skouras (Jack Hawkins), whose luxury yacht Shangri-La is anchored off the coast, may be behind the pirating of the gold bullion. While searching the surrounding area in a Royal Navy Helicopter, Calvert makes contact with a group of remote shark fishermen who appear more friendly than Torbay's locals. Calvert also meets the occupants of a Castle, Lord Kirkside and his teenage daughter, who behave strangely as well as being hostile. | As the helicopter brings Calvert back to Torbay it comes under attack from the shore and the Royal Navy pilot is killed. The helicopter crashes, explodes and plummets into the sea. Calvert escapes from the helicopter after it sinks to the bottom. When he returns to his research yacht Firecrest he finds Hunslett is missing. | Operating out of his yacht, Calvert is joined by his boss Sir Arthur Arnford-Jones, known as \"Uncle Arthur\" (Robert Morley). Together, they combat boarders and make ready for sea. On raising the anchor they find the dead body of Hunslett tied to it. | They are joined by Skouras's wife, Charlotte (Nathalie Delon), and when a pirate speedboat approaches, Calvert rams it, shoots the occupants and blows up the boat in vengeance for Hunslett's death. | Calvert recruits the shark fishermen to deal with Skouras and his modern day pirates. Guessing that the missing bullion ships are being sunk to allow the gold to be offloaded invisibly, Calvert dives in the bay and finds the Nantesville. He fights and kills one of the divers, whom he has previously encountered and who he suspects killed Hunslett. | He then secretly enters Kirkside's castle and questions the Lord's daughter, discovering that Skouras is an innocent victim whose real wife is being held hostage along with other locals down in the castle's dungeons. He then sneaks into the underground dock of the castle where the gold is being offloaded. | At midnight (eight bells) the shark fishermen ram the gates of the underground dock with their boat. The pirates are expecting them because Charlotte has been transmitting Calvert's plans to them by secret radio. A fire fight ensues in which the pirates are wiped out, after which Calvert lets Charlotte escape with a single bar of gold in her possession.","m_cast":"Anthony Hopkins as Philip Calvert | Robert Morley as Uncle Arthur | Nathalie Delon as Charlotte | Jack Hawkins as Sir Anthony Skouras | Corin Redgrave as Hunslett | Derek Bond as Lord Charnley | Ferdy Mayne as Lavorski | Maurice Roëves as Helicopter Pilot | Leon Collins as Tim Hutchinson | Wendy Allnutt as Sue Kirkside | Peter Arne as Imrie | Oliver MacGreevy as Quinn | Tom Chatto as Lord Kirkside | Edward Burnham as Macullum | Charles Gray uncredited voice of Sir Anthony Skouras","m_reception":"When Eight Bells Toll performed poorly in cinemas in the US, although it was more popular in Europe[6] and was the 11th most popular movie at the British box office in 1971.[7] | \"All thoroughly silly but routine rather than rotten,\" according to The Guardian.[8] | Connery returned to the Bond role and appeared in the successful Diamonds Are Forever, and the Bond series producers decided to continue the series when Connery left. The projected Phillip Calvert series was cancelled.","m_production":"Film rights to the novel were bought by the producing team of Elliot Kastner and Jerry Gershwin in 1966. They announced they would make the film as part of a 14-film slate over two years. Among the 14 movies were Maclean's Where Eagles Dare, which was a big hit in 1968, leading to high expectations for When Eight Bells Toll.[1] | MacLean elected to adapt his novel for the cinema himself, and kept the adaptation close to the novel. The story is very close to the source text, and features some of the same witty dialogue. Some of the twists in the ending have been changed, however, and a shootout replaces MacLean's original Agatha Christie-style summation. | Producer Elliott Kastner hoped that the film would be the first of a series of spy adventures films featuring MacLean's Philip Calvert character by capturing James Bond series fans after the anticipated demise of that series (Sean Connery was believed to be planning to quit the Bond role, and some thought that the Bond series would end after his departure). | Kastner considered Michael Jayston and Anthony Hopkins for the role of Calvert. Hopkins, then best known as a stage actor for his work at the National Theatre was chosen.[2] Hopkins says he turned down the role at first, worried about being an action star. \"It seemed too fast for me,\" he said. \"I could hear myself saying, 'Now wait a minute'. Then when I had finally overcome my fright I said to myself 'I'd be mad to turn this chance down.' I didn't.\"[3] | Bond film stunt arranger Bob Simmons helped him slim down to become a convincing Royal Naval officer trained as a commando and frogman.[4] | The main helicopter used in the film is a Westland Widgeon. There is also an Aérospatiale Alouette II. | Filming started in September 1969.[5] | The film was shot partly on location in Scotland.\"When Eight Bells Toll\".
