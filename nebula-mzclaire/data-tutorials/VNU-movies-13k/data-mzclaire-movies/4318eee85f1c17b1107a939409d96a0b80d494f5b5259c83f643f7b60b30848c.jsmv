{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1944 German-occupied Poland, the child Erik Lehnsherr is separated from his parents upon entering a concentration camp. While trying to reach them, he causes a set of metal gates to bend towards him, as though attracted by a magnetic force, before being knocked out by guards. Decades later, U.S. Senator Robert Kelly attempts to pass a \"Mutant Registration Act\" in Congress, which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. Present are Lehnsherr, now known as Magneto, and the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, who privately discuss their differing views on the relationship between humans and mutants. | In Meridian, Mississippi, 17-year-old Marie D'Ancanto accidentally puts her boyfriend into a coma upon kissing him, which is caused by her superhuman ability to absorb the life force and mutant abilities of anyone she touches. In fear, Marie, now going by the name Rogue, runs away to Laughlin City, Alberta. While at a bar, she meets Logan, also known as Wolverine, who possesses superhuman healing abilities, heightened senses, and metal claws that protrude from his knuckles. While on the road together, they are attacked by Victor Creed / Sabretooth, another mutant and an associate of Magneto. Cyclops and Storm arrive and save Wolverine and Rogue and bring them to the X-Mansion in Westchester County, New York. They are introduced to Xavier, who leads a group of mutants called the X-Men, who are trying to educate young mutants on their powers, and stop Magneto from escalating the war with humanity. | Senator Kelly is abducted by Magneto's allies Toad and the shapeshifter Mystique and brought to their lair, where Magneto uses Kelly as a test subject for a machine that artificially induces mutation. Kelly uses his new mutant abilities to escape imprisonment. After Rogue uses her powers on Wolverine, she is convinced by Mystique (disguised as classmate Bobby Drake) that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine Cerebro to find Rogue at a train station. Mystique later infiltrates Cerebro and sabotages the machine. | At the train station, Wolverine convinces Rogue to stay with Xavier, but a fight ensues when Magneto, Toad and Sabretooth arrive and kidnap Rogue. Kelly arrives at Xavier's school, but dies shortly after due to the instability of his artificial mutation, which causes his cells to break down into a puddle of water. The X-Men learn that Magneto was severely weakened while testing the machine on Kelly, and realize that he intends to use Rogue's power-transferring ability so that she can power the machine in his place, which will kill her. Xavier attempts to use Cerebro to locate Rogue, but Mystique's sabotage causes him to fall into a coma. Fellow telekinetic/telepath Jean Grey fixes Cerebro and uses it, learning that Magneto plans to place his mutation-inducing machine on Liberty Island and use it to mutate the world leaders meeting for a summit on nearby Ellis Island. | The X-Men scale the Statue of Liberty. Storm electrocutes Toad, and Wolverine stabs Mystique. Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue, and forces her to use them to start the machine. Cyclops dispatches Sabretooth with the help of Jean, who levitates his battle visor. Storm uses her weather-controlling powers and Jean uses her telekinesis to lift Wolverine up to Magneto's machine. Wolverine saves Rogue when Cyclops blasts Magneto out of the way, and destroys the machine. Wolverine touches the dying Rogue's face, and his healing abilities are transferred to her, causing her to recover. | Professor Xavier recovers from his coma. The group learns that Mystique is still alive, and impersonating Senator Kelly. Xavier tells Wolverine that near where he was found in Canada is an abandoned military base at Alkali Lake that might contain information about his past. Xavier visits Magneto in a prison cell constructed entirely of plastic, and the two play chess. Magneto warns him that he will continue his fight, to which Xavier promises that he and the X-Men will always be there to stop him.","m_cast":"Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier / Professor X | Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine | Ian McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto | Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe / Storm | Famke Janssen as Dr. Jean Grey: | James Marsden as Scott Summers / Cyclops | Bruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly | Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Raven Darkhölme / Mystique | Ray Park as Mortimer Toynbee / Toad | Tyler Mane as Victor Creed / Sabretooth | Anna Paquin as Marie / Rogue | Additionally, Shawn Ashmore appeared in a minor role as Bobby Drake / Iceman, a mutant student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters who takes a liking to Rogue. His powers include generating ice. David Hayter, Stan Lee, and Tom DeSanto make cameo appearances. George Buza, the voice of Beast in X-Men: The Animated Series, appeared as the truck driver who drops Rogue off at the bar at which Wolverine fights.[4] Other cameo appearances include Sumela Kay as Kitty Pryde, Katrina Florece as Jubilee and Donald MacKinnon as a young Colossus sketching a picture in one scene.[5][6] Gambit was considered for one of the students at the X-Mansion. Singer remembered, \"We thought about Gambit as the young boy on the basketball field, but the feeling was that if he has the basketball and then releases it and it exploded, [then] people would be like 'What's wrong with those basketballs?'\"[5]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Marvel Comics writers and chief editors Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas wrote an X-Men screenplay in 1984 when Orion Pictures held an option on the film rights, but development stalled when Orion began facing financial troubles.[8] Throughout 1989 and 1990, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont were in discussions with Carolco Pictures for an X-Men film adaptation,[9] with James Cameron as producer and Kathryn Bigelow directing. A story treatment was written by Bigelow, with Bob Hoskins being considered for Wolverine and Angela Bassett being considered for the role of Storm. The deal fell apart when Stan Lee piqued Cameron's interest on a Spider-Man film,[10] Carolco going bankrupt, and the film rights reverting to Marvel.[9] In December 1992, Marvel discussed selling the property to Columbia Pictures to no avail.[11] Meanwhile, Avi Arad produced the animated X-Men TV series for Fox Kids. 20th Century Fox was impressed by the success of the TV show, and producer Lauren Shuler Donner purchased the film rights for them in 1994,[9][12] bringing Andrew Kevin Walker to write the script.[13] | Walker's draft involved Professor Xavier recruiting Wolverine into the X-Men, which consists of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman, Beast, and Angel. The Brotherhood of Mutants, which consisted of Magneto, Sabretooth, Toad, Juggernaut and the Blob, try to conquer New York City, while Henry Peter Gyrich and Bolivar Trask attack the X-Men with three 8 feet (2.4 m) tall Sentinels. The script focused on the rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops, as well as the latter's self-doubt as a field leader. Part of the backstory invented for Magneto made him the cause of the Chernobyl disaster. The script also featured the X-Copter and the Danger Room. Walker turned in his second draft in June 1994.[14] Laeta Kalogridis,[15] John Logan, James Schamus,[4] and Joss Whedon were brought on for subsequent rewrites. One of these scripts kept the idea of Magneto turning Manhattan into a \"mutant homeland\", while another hinged on a romance between Wolverine and Storm.[12] Whedon's draft featured the Danger Room, and concluded with Jean Grey dressed as the Phoenix.[16] According to Entertainment Weekly, this screenplay was rejected because of its \"quick-witted pop culture-referencing tone\",[17] and the finished film contained only two dialogue exchanges that Whedon had contributed.[18] Michael Chabon pitched a six-page film treatment to Fox in 1996. It focused heavily on character development between Wolverine and Jubilee and included Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Beast, Iceman, and Storm. Under Chabon's plan, the villains would not have been introduced until the second film.[19] | Fox considered Brett Ratner as director,[20] and offered the position to Robert Rodriguez, but he turned it down.[21] Following the release of The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was looking to do a science fiction film and Fox offered him Alien Resurrection, but producer Tom DeSanto felt he would be more appropriate for X-Men.[9] The themes of prejudice in the comic resonated with Singer.[4] By December 1996, Singer was in the director's position, while Ed Solomon was hired to write the script in April 1997, and Singer went to film Apt Pupil. Fox then announced a Christmas 1998 release date.[22][23] In late 1997, the budget was projected at $60 million.[5] In late 1998, Singer and DeSanto sent a treatment to Fox, which they believed was \"perfect\" because it took \"seriously\" the themes and the comparisons between Xavier and Magneto and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, unlike the other scripts.[4] They made Rogue an important character because Singer recognized that her mutation, which renders her unable to touch anyone, was the most symbolic of alienation. Singer merged attributes of Kitty Pryde and Jubilee into the film's depiction of Rogue. Magneto's plot to mutate the world leaders into accepting his people is reminiscent of how Constantine I's conversion to Christianity ended the persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire; the analogy was emphasized in a deleted scene in which Storm teaches history. Senator Kelly's claim that he has a list of mutants living in the United States recalls Joseph McCarthy's similar claim regarding communists.[4] | Fox, who had projected the budget at $75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated would have cost $5 million more. Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room had to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X-Men.[12][24] Fox head Thomas Rothman argued that this would enhance the story,[12] and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey.[4] Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from The Usual Suspects, and together did another rewrite.[25][26] David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story credit.[12] The WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was more in line with Hayter's script than his.[27] | Russell Crowe was Singer's first choice to play Wolverine, but he turned it down,[4] instead recommending his friend, actor Hugh Jackman for the part.[28] Jackman was an unknown actor at the time, while a number of more established actors offered their services for the role, with Singer casting Dougray Scott. Part of Scott's contract included a sequel, but Scott backed out due to scheduling conflicts with Mission: Impossible II in early October 1999.[29][30][31] Jackman was then cast three weeks into filming, based on a successful audition.[32] | Patrick Stewart was first approached by Singer to play Xavier on the set of 1997's Conspiracy Theory, which was directed by X-Men executive producer Richard Donner.[33] James Caviezel was originally cast as Cyclops, but backed out due to scheduling conflicts with Frequency.[34] James Marsden was unfamiliar with his character, but soon became accustomed after reading various comic books. Marsden modeled his performance similar to a Boy Scout.[35] Eric Mabius expressed interest for the role of Cyclops. Angela Bassett was approached to portray Storm in late 1997,[5] as was Janet Jackson.[36] Anna Paquin dropped out of the lead role in Tart in favor of X-Men.[37] Terence Stamp was considered for Magneto[38] before Singer cast Ian McKellen, who acted in his previous film, Apt Pupil. McKellen responded to the gay allegory of the film, \"the allegory of the mutants as outsiders, disenfranchised and alone and coming to all of that at puberty when their difference manifests,\" Singer explained. \"Ian is an activist and he really responded to the potential of that allegory.\"[33] | The original start date was mid-1999,[39] with the release date set for Christmas 2000, but Fox moved X-Men to June. Steven Spielberg had been scheduled to film Minority Report for release in June 2000, but he had chosen to film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Fox needed a film to fill the void.[40] This meant that Singer had to finish X-Men six months ahead of schedule, although filming had been pushed back.[41] The release date was then moved to July 14.[42] | Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000 in Toronto and in Hamilton, Ontario.[43][44] Locations included Central Commerce Collegiate, Distillery District and Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.[45] Casa Loma, Roy Thomson Hall and Metro Hall were used for X-Mansion interiors, while Parkwood Estate (located in Oshawa, east of Toronto) was chosen for exteriors.[45] Spencer Smith Park (in Burlington, Ontario) doubled for Liberty Island.[45] Post-production was hectic, with Shuler Donner saying that \"we had to lock picture and score and edit, sometimes at the same time.\"[46] | The filmmakers decided not to replicate the X-Men costumes as seen in the comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, \"you can do that on a drawing, but when you put it on people it's disturbing!\"[9] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics,[4] but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen.[47] To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line \"What would you prefer, yellow spandex?\" – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing,[4] and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them \"blend into the night\".[48] | Oakley, Inc. provided the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized version of the company's own X-Metal Juliet.[49] Wolverine's claws required a full silicone cast of Hugh Jackman's arm, and over 700 pairs for Jackman and his stunt doubles.[50] It took nine hours to apply Rebecca Romijn's prosthetic makeup.[51] She could not drink wine, use skin creams, or fly the day before filming, because it could have caused her body chemistry to change slightly, causing the 110 prosthetics applied to her skin to fall off.[12] Between takes, the makeup department kept Romijn isolated in a windowless room to ensure secrecy. Romijn reflected, \"I had almost no contact with the rest of the cast; it was like I was making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell.\"[12] | In the late 1990s, computer-generated imagery was becoming more commonly used. Singer visited the sets of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace and Titanic to understand practical and digital effects.[5] Filming had started without a special effects company hired. Digital Domain, Cinesite, Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co., Hammerhead Production, Matte World Digital, CORE and POP were all hired in December 1999.[52] Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink admitted to have been dissatisfied with his work on X-Men in 2003, despite nearly being nominated for an Academy Award.[53] | Digital Domain's technical director Sean C. Cunningham and lead compositor Claas Henke morphed Bruce Davison into a liquid figure for Kelly's mutation scene. Cunningham said, \"There were many digital layers: water without refraction, water with murkiness, skin with and without highlights, skin with goo in it. When rendered together, it took 39 hours per frame.\" They considered showing Kelly's internal organs during the transformation, \"but that seemed too gruesome\", according to Cunningham.[54]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"X-Men  by Jack Kirby Stan Lee","m_directed_by":"Bryan Singer","m_produced_by":"Lauren Shuler Donner | Ralph Winter","m_screenplay_by":"David Hayter","m_story_by":"Tom DeSanto | Bryan Singer","m_starring":"Patrick Stewart | Hugh Jackman | Ian McKellen | Halle Berry | Famke Janssen | James Marsden | Bruce Davison | Rebecca Romijn-Stamos | Ray Park | Anna Paquin","m_music_by":"Michael Kamen","m_cinematography":"Newton Thomas Sigel","m_edited_by":"Steven Rosenblum | Kevin Stitt | John Wright","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"July 13, 2000 (2000-07-13) (Australia) | July 14, 2000 (2000-07-14) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$75 million[2]","m_box_office":"$296.3 million[2][3] | X-Men is a 2000 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the first installment in the X-Men film series. The film, directed by Bryan Singer and written by David Hayter, features an ensemble cast that includes Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ray Park, and Anna Paquin. It depicts a world in which a small proportion of people are mutants, whose possession of superhuman powers makes them distrusted by normal humans. The film focuses on the mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutant-kind: Professor Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto. | Development for X-Men began as far back as 1984 with Orion Pictures. At one point James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow were in discussions. The film rights went to 20th Century Fox in 1994 and various scripts and film treatments were commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie and Hayter in which Beast and Nightcrawler were deleted over budget concerns from Fox. X-Men marks the Hollywood debut of actor Hugh Jackman, who was a last-second choice for Wolverine, cast three weeks into filming. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in Toronto. X-Men was released to positive reviews and was a financial success, starting the X-Men film franchise and spawning a reemergence of superhero films. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"X-MEN (12)\".
