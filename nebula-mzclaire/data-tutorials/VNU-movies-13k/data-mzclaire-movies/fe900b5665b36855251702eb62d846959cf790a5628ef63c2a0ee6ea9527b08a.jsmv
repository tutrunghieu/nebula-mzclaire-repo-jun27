{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"DeeDee (Shirley MacLaine) left the ballet company after becoming pregnant by Wayne (Tom Skerritt), another dancer in the company. They marry and later move to Oklahoma City to run a dance studio. Emma (Anne Bancroft) stays with the company and eventually becomes a prima ballerina and well-known figure in the ballet community. | While the company is on tour and performs a show in Oklahoma City, DeeDee and the family go to see the show, and then have an after-party for the company at her home. The reunion stirs up old memories and things begin to unravel. | At the party, DeeDee's aspiring dancer/daughter, Emilia (Leslie Browne), who is also Emma's goddaughter, is invited to take class with the company the following day. After taking class with the company, Emilia is asked to join the company but she does not immediately accept the offer as she wants to think it over before making her final decision. DeeDee and Wayne decide that DeeDee should go to New York with Emilia, who is rather shy and doesn't make friends as easily as her younger sister. Meanwhile their son, Ethan gets a scholarship to the company's summer program while Wayne and their other daughter stay in Oklahoma City. | Once in New York, they rent several rooms in Carnegie Hall with Madame Dakharova, a ballet coach. Emilia soon starts a relationship with a Russian playboy in the company, Yuri (Mikhail Baryshnikov). DeeDee runs into the former conductor of the company and has an affair with him, which causes conflict between Emilia and DeeDee. Meanwhile, Emma argues with Arnold, the choreographer, about giving her a better role in his new ballet, which he refuses and leads Emma to suggest Emilia for the role instead. It's also revealed Emma has been seeing a married man, Carter. During rehearsal, Emilia has an argument with Arnold and storms out, going to a bar and getting intoxicated. She then shows up for the performance that night still intoxicated and Emma takes care of her, which angers DeeDee. Emilia suffers when she sees Yuri getting involved with another dancer, Carolyn. | Emma and DeeDee eventually enter into major conflict. DeeDee resents that Emma dotes on Emilia, when she has criticized DeeDee for choosing family life over her career while Emma chose not to have children. DeeDee accuses Emma of being glad she got pregnant so Emma could play the lead in Anna Karenina, which Emma later admits is true. | Eventually, misunderstandings are settled, with Emma and DeeDee working things out after a physical altercation. Emilia is announced as the star of the next season, and she and Yuri make up and agree to a professional partnership and nothing more. Deedee decides she is content with her life and the decision she made to leave professional ballet to have a family. Emma accepts that her performing days are numbered and she must embrace a different role within the company.","m_cast":"A number of actresses were offered the roles of Emma and DeeDee before Maclaine and Bancroft signed on, including Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Doris Day.[2] | Bancroft had no previous dance experience, while Maclaine had started her career as a dancer on Broadway performing in the musicals Me and Juliet and The Pajama Game. | The title \"The Turning Point\" is a double entendre, meaning a big change in a person's life and being on pointe. The film shares many similarities with Black Swan; there is even a ballet performed in The Turning Point titled Black Swan. | Choreography for the film was done by Alvin Ailey and George Balanchine, among others.","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Herbert Ross","m_produced_by":"Arthur Laurents Herbert Ross Nora Kaye","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Shirley MacLaine Anne Bancroft Tom Skerritt Mikhail Baryshnikov Leslie Browne","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Robert Surtees","m_edited_by":"William H.
