{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Twelve-year-old Dre Parker and his mother Sherry move from Detroit to Beijing after Sherry gets a job transfer at her car factory. After a day in a park, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep them apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school. During an attack, the maintenance man Mr. Han comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as a kung fu master. | After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students at an open kung fu tournament, and also requests the students leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament. Li accepts the offer, but tells Han that if Dre does not show up during the tournament, he will personally bring pain to Han and Dre. | Han promises to teach Dre \"real\" kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre go through various actions with his jacket, which teaches Dre muscle memory moves. Han then takes Dre to a temple in the Wudang Mountains where he trained with his father, and Dre witnesses a woman making a cobra reflect her movements and drinks the water from an ancient Chinese well. | As Dre's friendship with Meiying continues, Dre persuades Meiying to cut school for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin audition which was brought forward a day without their knowledge, her parents deem him a bad influence and forbid her from spending more time with him. | During the course of their training, Han gives Dre a day off. Dre goes to Han that night and finds Han, apparently drunk, smashing a car he was working on. Han tells Dre that he crashed the same car years ago, and that his wife and ten-year-old son were with him and died in the car crash. Han fixes the car every year but smashes it to remind himself of what happened, which makes Dre work much harder in his training in order to help Han forget about the incident. Han assists Dre in reading a note of apology to Meiying's father in Chinese; he accepts and promises that Meiying will attend the tournament to support Dre. | At the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his opponents, but soon begins beating them and advances to the semifinals, as does Cheng, who violently finishes off his opponents. Dre comes up against Liang, one of Li's more sympathetic students, who (under Li's goading) severely hurts Dre's leg and Liang is disqualified as a result, while Dre is taken to the infirmary. | Despite Han's insistence that he has earned respect for his performance, Dre convinces Han to mend his leg by using fire cupping in order to continue. Dre returns to the arena, facing Cheng in the final. Dre delivers impressive blows, but Cheng is told by Li to break Dre's leg, which he does with a powerful strike. Dre struggles to get up, and attempts the reflection technique to manipulate Cheng into changing his attack stance. Cheng begins reflecting Dre's movements and it goads him into charging Dre, but Dre flips and catches Cheng with a kick to his head, winning the tournament along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng, instead of the presenter, awards Dre the trophy, and the Fighting Dragon students bow to Mr. Han, accepting him as their new master.","m_cast":"Jaden Smith as Dre Parker (德瑞∙帕克 Déruì Pàkè) – A young boy from Detroit, Michigan who is bullied by another student, and learns to stand up to him in a kung-fu tournament. | Jackie Chan as Mr. Han (S: 韩先生, T: 韓先生, P: Hán-xiānsheng) – The maintenance man who teaches Dre kung-fu. | Taraji P.

The site's consensus reads: \"It may not be as powerful as the 1984 edition, but the 2010 Karate Kid delivers a surprisingly satisfying update on the original.\"[22] Metacritic, another review aggregator, rated the film 61/100 based on 37 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[23] | Ann Hornaday described Jaden Smith as a revelation, and that he \"proves that he's no mere beneficiary of dynastic largesse. Somber, self-contained and somehow believable as a kid for whom things don't come easily, he never conveys the sense that he's desperate to be liked. 'The Karate Kid' winds up being so likable itself.\"[24] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it a positive review, rating the film three and a half out of four stars, and calling it \"a lovely and well-made film that stands on its own feet\".[25] Claudia Puig of USA Today and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly each rated the film a 'B', stating \"the chemistry between Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan grounds the movie, imbuing it with sincerity and poignance\" and that the film is \"fun and believable\".[26][27] | Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film one and a half stars and noted \"The characters just aren't old enough to be convincing in their hormone-driven need to prove themselves\" and \"This age gap is also a huge problem when it comes to the range that these kids bring to the project\" and noted the portrayal of the child antagonist Cheng includes an \"overblown and overused grimace, which looks like it might have originally belonged to Dolph Lundgren, looks especially silly on a kid that hasn't learned how to shave yet.\" Finally, Abrams noted \"What's most upsetting is Dre's budding romance with Meiying. These kids have yet to hit puberty and already they're swooning for each other.\"[28] | The film was released on June 11, 2010 by Columbia Pictures to 3,663 theaters across the United States.

Chan told interviewers that film cast members generally referred to the film as The Kung Fu Kid, and he believed the film would only be called The Karate Kid in America, and The Kung Fu Kid in China.[8] This theory held true in the People's Republic of China, where the film is titled The Kung Fu Dream (Chinese: 功夫梦),[9] and in Japan[10] and South Korea,[11] where the film is titled Best Kid (Japanese: ベスト・キッド; Korean: 베스트 키드) after the local title of the 1984 film in both countries. | Sony had considered changing title of the film, but Jerry Weintraub, one of the producers, rejected the idea. Weintraub was also the producer of the original Karate Kid.[12] | The Chinese government granted the filmmakers access to the Forbidden City, the Great Wall of China, and the Wudang Mountains. On some occasions, the filmmakers had to negotiate with residents who were not accustomed to filming activity.[13] | Icelandic composer Atli Örvarsson was originally hired to score the film, but he was replaced by American composer James Horner.

The music video was released on May 31, 2010.[16] | The film started with \"Do You Remember\" by Jay Sean. \"Remember the Name\" by Fort Minor was used in the trailer to promote the movie. Parts of the song, \"Back in Black\" by AC/DC and \"Higher Ground\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, were also used in the movie. The song \"Hip Song\" by Rain is used for promotion in the Asian countries and it appeared in the trailer. The music video was released on May 22, 2010.[17] \"Bang Bang\" by K'naan featuring Adam Levine and \"Say\" by John Mayer are also featured in the movie.[18] It also features Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\", Flo Rida's \"Low\" and Gorillaz' \"Dirty Harry\" (being performed in Chinese).
