{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Some years after his dangerous ride down the steep mountain to capture the Brumby herd and regain the Colt from old \"Regret\", Jim Craig, now with a large herd of mountain-bred horses of his own, returns to his home vicinity to take up with his girl, Jessica Harrison. She is still smitten with him, but opposition from her father remains as resolute as ever. Further, she also has a rich would-be suitor endeavouring to court her, Alistair Patton, son of the banker from whom Harrison is seeking a large loan. Before he returns from Harrison's property to his home, Jim meets an army officer seeking quality horses for the remount service on a regular basis. | As the young Patton realizes Jessica's affections remain for Jim, and that she doesn't \"give a damn\" about him (Patton), he jealously and maliciously recruits a gang to steal Jim's horses. Jim gives chase and in so doing again rides his horse down the steep mountainside. Patton shoots at him; the horse is killed and Jim is injured but manages to recover and resume the pursuit. As Jim had earlier let the wild stallion which led the brumbies loose into the wild again, in a twist of fate, the stallion shows itself from the wild at this crucial moment, and Jim finally trains this horse that has been the enigma of the entire district for decades. As he breaks him in and learns to ride him, they become friends, and together, they catch up to Patton and his gang. | Jessica's father has also relented during this time, seen 'the light' and eventually joins with Jim and his 'rough-rider' friends to hunt down Patton and his gang. Jim Craig gets and wins his man-on-man duel with the chief 'villain', Allistair Patton, and Harrison gives his final approval for Jessica and Jim's alliance and the couple marry.","m_cast":"Tom Burlinson as Jim Craig | Sigrid Thornton as Jessica Harrison | Brian Dennehy as Harrison | Nicholas Eadie as Alistair Patton | Mark Hembrow as Seb | Bryan Marshall as Hawker | Rhys McConnochie as Patton Snr. | Peter Cummins as Jake | Cornelia Frances as Mrs. Darcy | Tony Barry as Jacko | Wynn Roberts as Priest | Alec Wilson as Patton's Croney | Peter Browne as Reilly | Alan Hopgood as Simmons | Mark Pennell as Collins","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Geoff Burrowes, who produced the first movie, decided to direct as he felt he would clash with any other director because he felt so strongly about the material.[2] | A horse was put down during the making of the movie which led to a Victorian government inquiry, which ruled the horse was killed needlessly.[3][4][5][6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Geoff Burrowes","m_produced_by":"Geoff Burrowes","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Tom Burlinson | Sigrid Thornton | Brian Dennehy | Nicholas Eadie | Bryan Marshall | Mark Hembrow","m_music_by":"Bruce Rowland","m_cinematography":"Keith Wagstaff","m_edited_by":"Gary Woodyard","m_production_company":"Walt Disney Pictures Silver Screen Partners III Burrowes Film Group The Hoyts Group","m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"15 April 1988 (1988-04-15) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English","m_budget":"A$8.7 million[1]","m_box_office":"$13,687,027 | The Man from Snowy River II is a 1988 Australian drama film, the sequel to the 1982 film The Man from Snowy River. | It was released in the United States as Return to Snowy River, and in the United Kingdom as The Untamed. | Reprising their roles from the first film were Tom Burlinson (as \"Jim Craig\") and Sigrid Thornton (as \"Jessica Harrison\") - while Brian Dennehy appeared as \"Harrison\", instead of Kirk Douglas. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Production Barometer\", Cinema Papers, May 1988 p46 | ^ David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p67 | ^ Larry Schrwartz, \"Doubt Cast on Need for Mare's Death\", Sydney Morning Herald, 5 June 1987 p2 | ^ \"Film director set to sue RSPCA.\".
