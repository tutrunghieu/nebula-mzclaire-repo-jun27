{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is a slice of a housewife's life in 1980s post-Franco Madrid: Gloria lives in a small and cheap apartment with husband and two teenage children: the declared homosexual Miguel, whom she sells to the dentist, and the drug-dealing Toni. Her husband, Antonio, longs for a German woman for whom he was a chauffeur in Germany before he married Gloria. | Gloria's mother-in-law, a frugal and unhappy woman who hides her Magdalena cakes and desperately wants to move back to her native countryside, is another addition to Gloria's household. Cristal, a prostitute who lives next door, is Gloria's best friend. | When Gloria's husband assaults her in the kitchen, she accidentally kills him after hitting him with a ham leg. Her mother-in-law's lizard, Money, is the only witness to the crime. Gloria successfully evades the investigators and is never tied to the murder. There are many subplots intertwined with the main narrative with characters including a writer, his beauty-obsessed wife and an impotent policeman frustrated by his lack of sexual power.","m_cast":"Carmen Maura as Gloria | Ángel de Andrés López as Antonio | Verónica Forqué as Cristal | Gonzalo Suárez as Lucas Villalba | Miguel Ángel Herranz as Miguel | Juan Martínez as Toni | Cecilia Roth as Chica anuncio | Ryo Hiruma as Professor Kendo | Pedro Almodóvar as Playback 'La bien pagá' | Tinín Almodóvar as Cajero","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Pedro Almodóvar","m_produced_by":"Hervé Hachuel","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Carmen Maura Ángel de Andrés López Verónica Forqué Gonzalo Suárez","m_music_by":"Bernardo Bonezzi","m_cinematography":"Ángel L.

The film, set in the tower blocks around Madrid, depicts female frustration and family breakdown, echoing Jean-Luc Godard's Two or Three Things I Know About Her and strong story plots from Roald Dahl's Lamb to the slaughter and Truman Capote's A Day´s work but with Almodóvar's unique approach to filmmaking. Carmen Maura has often worked for Almodóvar, she became a synonym for a strong woman and also a gay icon for her role as a transsexual in Law of Desire. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS?
