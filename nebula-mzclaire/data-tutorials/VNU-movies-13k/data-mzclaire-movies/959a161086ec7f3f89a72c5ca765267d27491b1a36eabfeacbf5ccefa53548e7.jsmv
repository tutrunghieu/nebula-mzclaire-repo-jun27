{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Two years after their battle with the Shredder, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo, still live beneath the sewers, having allowed Vern Fenwick to take the credit for Shredder's defeat. April O'Neil discovers that a scientist named Baxter Stockman is working for Shredder and that he plans to help Shredder escape from prison. April informs the turtles about this. As Shredder is transferred between prisons with two criminals alongside him, Bebop and Rocksteady, by corrections officer Casey Jones, the Foot Clan attack the convoy transporting him. Despite the turtles interference, Shredder escapes when Stockman uses a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and winds up in another dimension. There, he meets the alien warlord Krang, who tells him about his plans to invade Earth and gives him a mutagenic compound in exchange for his promise to find three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago, which will open a portal to his dimension when united, and he knows that Shredder and Stockman have the first piece. After Casey's failure to transport the prisoners, he decides to go out on his own. | Shredder returns to New York City and recruits Bebop and Rocksteady, who also escaped, and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them into powerful animal mutants - a warthog and rhinoceros. April witnesses their transformation and is able to steal the vial of mutagen. Pursued by the Foot, she is rescued by Casey, who uses hockey gear. In the enusing battle, the vial of mutagen is taken into police custody. April then introduces Casey to the turtles. In the lair, Donatello deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the turtles into humans, enabling them to live normal lives above ground, but Leonardo refuses and insists on keeping it a secret from the others. However, Michelangelo overhears their conversation and tells Raphael, which enrages Raphael and leading to a fierce argument between the brothers. Leonardo benches Raphael and takes Michelangelo off the mission. In the National Museum in New York, Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady are able to find the second piece and steal it, before Leonardo and Donatello arrive. Still furious, Raphael recruits Michelangelo, April, Casey, and Vern to break into the NYPD police headquarters and retrieve the mutagen. Vern distracts the police, while April and Casey retrieve the mutagen, but the Foot arrive ahead of them. In the ensuing battle, the turtles existence is revealed to the police, who react with fear and hatred. April and Casey intervene and help the brothers escape, but April and Casey are arrested. The police also see on TCRI's cameras that April stole the mutagen. | With Shredder's forces having already recovered two pieces of the device, the turtles track Bebop and Rocksteady as they recover the final piece in the rainforests of Manaus, Brazil. The turtles confront Bebop and Rocksteady in their jet and in the ensuing battle, the jet is destroyed. However, Bebop and Rocksteady manage to escape with the final component. The turtles return to New York as Shredder and Stockman complete the portal device and open the gateway to Krang's dimension, through which his modular war machine, the Technodrome, begins to emerge. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away to their headquarters in Tokyo, but upon entering the Technodrome, Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes. April calls Vern to find out about the camera that incriminated in TCRI. | Seeing no way to combat the Technodrome, the turtles debate over taking the mutagen in order to become humans and fight openly. Though Leonardo agrees to do it, Raphael shatters the vial, realizing they must accept who they are. Vern recovers security footage that proves Stockman's and Shredder's crimes and secures April and Casey's release, allowing them to set up a meeting between the turtles and police chief Rebecca Vincent, where they convince her that they are not enemies and that they were the ones who took down Shredder in the first place. With the help of the police, the turtles are able to confront Krang aboard the still-assembling Technodrome. Meanwhile, Casey keeps Bebop and Rocksteady busy and defeats them while April and Vern defeat Shredder's lieutenant Karai and take control of the portal device. The turtles are able to hurl the beacon back through the portal, taking Krang and the rest of the Technodrome with it. April, Casey, and Vern then shut the portal down. As he disappears, Krang swears he will return for revenge. | In the aftermath, Bebop and Rocksteady are taken back into custody, while Stockman remains at large. At night, the Turtles are honored by Vincent and the NYPD, along with April, Casey, and Vern,and gives the turtles golden keys to the city, and she said to give an opportunity to the people and accept them, but the turtles elect to keep their existence a secret from the public, but they will always have help when they want. On top of the Statue of Liberty, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles celebrate the vanished Krang.","m_cast":"Megan Fox as April O'Neil | Stephen Amell as Casey Jones | Will Arnett as Vern Fenwick | Brian Tee as Oroku Saki / The Shredder[8] | Tyler Perry as Dr. Baxter Stockman | Brittany Ishibashi as Karai[9] | Laura Linney as Police Chief Rebecca Vincent[10] | Supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio has a cameo appearance.[11] NBA players Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, Lou Amundson, J.

In comparable to Saturday releases, the figure is almost double the launch of Big Hero 6; 41% above the first film; and 18% higher than The Angry Birds Movie.[95] | It will next open in key markets like Italy (July 7), Germany (August 11) and Japan (August 26).[97] | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows received mixed reviews, with many critics noting it as an improvement over its predecessor. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 38%, based on 135 reviews, with a rating average of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a slight improvement over its predecessor, but still lacks the wit or anarchic energy of the comics that birthed the franchise.\"[98] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[99] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale, an improvement over the first film's \"B\".[100] | Glenn Kenny of The New York Times gave the film a positive review writing, \"This movie is, it happens, easier to sit through than the 2014 film\", while also adding that \"The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are even a couple of amusing, albeit unmemorable, sight gags and one-liners.\"[101] Edward Douglas of New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars, saying, \"As with the best popcorn flicks, Out of the Shadows offers plenty of mindless entertainment and mind-numbing silliness that somehow works well enough to leave even the Ninja Turtles' biggest detractors shell-shocked.\"[102] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post praised the film's action sequences and story while overall writing that, \"Out of the Shadows is, at least, deliciously silly, even if it is also decidedly forgettable. Like a well-plated but nutrition-free meal, it registers on the senses while being bad for you.\"[103] | Peter Hartlaub of San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, writing, \"Your 11-year-old is going to love this film. Then he'll grow up and wonder what he was thinking.\"[104] Sara Stewart of The New York Post gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, \"despite the title, the wisecracking turtles named for Renaissance painters are never allowed to shine... It’s a bummer, dude.\"[105] Lindsey Bahr of the Associated Press gave the film one star out of four and said, \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a Saturday morning cartoon on Michael Bay steroids. For the under 12 set, that's fine. For the rest of us? It's something to actively avoid.\"[106]","m_production":"After the 2014 film exceeded box office expectations, Paramount and Nickelodeon officially announced a sequel was greenlit, and set to be released in theatres on June 3, 2016,[20] with plans to incorporate the characters Casey Jones and Bebop and Rocksteady.[21] Jonathan Liebesman and Brad Fuller were also interested in doing a storyline that involved Dimension X and Krang.[22] In December 2014, it was revealed Paramount was in early negotiations with Earth to Echo director Dave Green to helm the sequel, also revealing Jonathan Liebesman was no longer a part of the project.[23] Known briefly as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Half Shell,[24] Paramount revealed in December 2015 that the title had officially been changed to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.[5][6] | Megan Fox and Will Arnett were confirmed to be returning as April O'Neil and Vern Fenwick respectively; also confirmed were the Shredder's, and Bebop and Rocksteady debut in the movie.[25] In an interview, William Fichtner stated that he would be returning as Eric Sacks. However, for unknown reasons, he was not in a trailer for the film or a TV spot, and ultimately did not appear in the final film. However, he could return in the third installment, considering he (along with the turtle actors, Noel Fisher, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson and Pete Ploszek) signed on for three TMNT films.[26] Production was confirmed to start in April 2015,[27] along with the casting of Alessandra Ambrosio, and several members of the Los Angeles Clippers.[28][29] On March 31, Stephen Amell was cast as Casey Jones, after test reading alongside several different actors.[30] Amell acknowledged the character bore similarities to his Oliver Queen from Arrow. He stated the characters are \"fundamentally different\" from one another, but that Casey did resemble Oliver from older versions.[31] On April 23, Tyler Perry was cast as scientist Baxter Stockman, replacing K. Todd Freeman, who played the role in the 2014 film.[32] On April 27, Brian Tee joined the cast as the Shredder, replacing Tohoru Masamune from the first film.[33] On April 30, Laura Linney was cast in an unspecified role.[10] On May 14, Gary Anthony Williams was cast as Bebop,[16] while on May 28, WWE wrestler Stephen \"Sheamus\" Farrelly was confirmed to play Rocksteady.[17] On May 27, Minae Noji was replaced with Brittany Ishibashi in the role of Karai.[9] In August 2015, former WWE superstar CM Punk revealed that he lost the role of Rocksteady to Sheamus.[34] In March 2016, it was announced that Fred Armisen would voice Krang in the film.[35][36] However, in May 2016, shortly before the film's release, it was revealed that Brad Garrett would voice Krang instead due to Armisen having schedule conflicts.[37] In April 2016, while promoting Elvis & Nixon, Johnny Knoxville revealed that he was not asked to return for the sequel as the voice of Leonardo.[38] | On April 2, 2016, Steve Jablonsky revealed that he would compose the music score, replacing Brian Tyler from the first film.[39] Mexican teen boy band CD9 performed an updated version of the original show's theme song for the film.[40] The film score soundtrack was released on June 3, 2016, on digital and compact discs.[41] | Filming began in April in New York City and Buffalo, spending about $70 million in the state.[42] Filming began on April 27, 2015, when the film crew was spotted filming in Midtown Manhattan and moved out to Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil.[43] Filming in Buffalo began on May 4, 2015, along the Kensington Expressway[44][45] and ended May 17, 2015.[46] Filming wrapped up in August 2015.[47][48] Additional filming occurred in New York City on January 30, and ended on February 1.
