{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Will Randall is bitten by a wolf while driving home in Vermont. Afterwards, he is demoted from editor-in-chief of a publishing house when it is taken over by tycoon Raymond Alden, who replaces him with Will's protégé Stewart Swinton. When Will thinks that his wife Charlotte is having an affair with Stewart, he rushes over to his house where Stewart sees Will angry and asks him what the problem is. Will bites Stewart and rushes upstairs to the room to find Charlotte half-naked. His worst fears are confirmed. Will becomes more aggressive, taking on the characteristics of a wolf. | With the help of Alden's headstrong daughter Laura, Will sets out for his new life. His first escapade as a werewolf takes place at Laura's estate, where he wakes up at night and hunts down a deer. In the morning, Will finds himself on the bank of a stream, with blood all over his face and hands. He visits Dr. Vijav Alezais, who gives him an amulet to protect him from turning completely into a wolf. Alezais asks Will to bite him, as Alezais does not have long to live and would prefer \"demonization to death\". After refusing, Will keeps the amulet so that he will not transform at the next full moon. Calling Laura to explain, Will, now a werewolf, breaks into the zoo and steals handcuffs from a policeman. Muggers want his wallet, but he attacks and bites the fingers off of one of them. He wakes up in his hotel, with no memory of what happened. | Will outmaneuvers Stewart at their work and fires him, urinating on his shoes in a bathroom and claiming he is \"marking his territory\". While washing his hands, Stewart finds fingers in his handkerchief and realizes he has attacked and wounded someone. Stewart attempts to frame Will in order to seize his job back. Detective Bridger knocks on Will's door the next day to deliver him the news that Charlotte was found dead with canine DNA on her body. Will then wonders if he murdered Charlotte, but he does not know it was Stewart who killed her. | Believing Will is a murderer, Laura goes to the police station. There she runs into Stewart, who makes an animal-like pass at her while sporting increasingly obvious werewolf traits. Laura hurries away, making arrangements for her and Will to leave the country. Stewart follows Laura back to her father's estate and kills two guards. After a brief struggle in the barn, Stewart attempts to rape her, Will intervenes, and the two fight. Stewart is shot to death by Laura. After he returns to his human state, Will has a brief moment with Laura and then runs into the forest. | Minutes later, Laura shows heightened senses when the police arrive, telling Bridger that she can smell vodka on his breath. The final scene is a close-up of her face fading into dark, wolf eyes, and a close up of Will completing his transformation into a full werewolf.","m_cast":"Jack Nicholson as Will Randall | Michelle Pfeiffer as Laura Alden | James Spader as Stewart Swinton | Kate Nelligan as Charlotte Skylar Randall | Richard Jenkins as Detective Carl Bridger | Christopher Plummer as Raymond Alden | Eileen Atkins as Mary | David Hyde Pierce as Roy MacAllister | Om Puri as Dr. Vijav Alezais | Ron Rifkin as Doctor Ralph | Prunella Scales as Maude Waggins | Brian Markinson as Detective Wade | Peter Gerety as George | Bradford English as Keyes | Stewart J.
