{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In inner city London, a street dance crew is on the verge of breaking up after its leader, Jay (Ukweli Roach), leaves the group unexpectedly. The group loses the use of their rehearsal space, forcing them to try to raise money or practice in other locations. Eventually they secure a space in a ballet school, on the condition that they include five ballet dancers in their routine. At first, they struggle to get along, but they all become friends in the end. | One of the teachers at the ballet school, Helena (Charlotte Rampling), takes Carly (Nichola Burley) to a ballet where she starts getting ideas for their routine. When she arrives home, Carly finds Jay waiting for her and the two spend the night having sex. During a dance battle in a club the next night, the team learn that Jay has betrayed the team by joining The Surge, a rival crew. Jay brags about his sex with Carly and Tomas (Richard Winsor), a ballet dancer, punches Jay out of anger. Jay is furious and swears revenge. Carly, upset over the betrayal, leaves the club and is nearly hit by a car before Tomas pulls her out of the way. Tomas then takes Carly back to his apartment where they dance on the roof, eventually kissing. Carly then leaves him alone on the roof, while they both look at the sunrise and smile. | The next day at the school, Carly announces the new name of their dance crew: Breaking Point. Another teacher at the school, outraged that her students are being corrupted, deliberately plans a Royal Ballet audition for the same day as the street dance finals. The ballet dancers promise Carly they will make it, but the auditions were running overtime. | In an attempt to give Breakin Point more time to wait for the ballet dancers, Carly's friend Eddie (George Sampson) goes out onto the dance floor and starts dancing, surprising the crew and wowing the audience. The ballet team turn up at the final anyway, and their teacher Helena drives the Royal Ballet judges to the streetdancing final so they can see the dancers perform. The routine is a success, Carly and Tomas kiss during the performance, and the crowd is enthralled. Jay is furious that The Surge have been beaten and he's lost Carly. | The film ends with Breaking Point and The Surge dancing to N-Dubz' \"We Dance On\".","m_cast":"Nichola Burley as Carly | Richard Winsor as Tomas | Ukweli Roach as Jay | Frank Harper as Fred | George Sampson as Eddie | Charlotte Rampling as Helena | Eleanor Bron as Madame Fluerie | Patrick Baladi as Mr Harding | Teneisha Bonner as Shawna | Lex Milczarek as Boogie | Kofi Agyemang-Prempeh as Mac | Hugo Cortes as Gabe | Sianad Gregory as Chloe | Jennifer Leung as Bex | Rachel McDowall as Isabella | Rhimes Lecointe as Justine | Sacha Chang as Aimee | Bradley Charles as Frankie | Lil Steph as Steph | Brooke Milliner as Brooke | Jeremy Sheffield as Michael | Flawless as The Surge | Ashley Banjo as Aaron | Diversity as Aaron's Crew | Jordan Long as Security Guard | Jocelyn Jee Esien as Delilah (Shawna's boss) | Tameka Empson as Sharonda (Shawna's colleague) | Akai Osei-Mansfield as Dancing Kid in Shopping Mall | Leigh Alderson as a Featured Dancer | Babbal Kumar as dark dancer | Kyle Davey as a Featured Dancer | Brendan Conway as an Audience Dancer","m_reception":"The film received some positive reviews and has a 77% \"fresh\" rating from Rotten Tomatoes[4] However the film was #1 for only one week in the U.K. after making £2,273,938 in box office,.[5] The film's box-office earnings after their theatrical run was $17,695,464.
