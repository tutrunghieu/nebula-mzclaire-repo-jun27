{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Recent graduates of Georgetown University Alec, girlfriend Leslie, Kevin, Jules, and Kirby are waiting to hear about the conditions of their friends Wendy, a sweet-natured girl devoted to helping others, and Billy, a former frat boy and now reluctant husband and father, after a car accident. At the hospital, Kirby sees a medical student named Dale, with whom he has been infatuated since college. | The group gathers at their favorite college hangout, St. Elmo’s Bar. Billy has been fired from the job Alec helped him secure and his marriage is unstable. At their apartment, Alec pressures Leslie to marry him, but she is convinced they are not ready.

When he visits Alec and Leslie for dinner, Alec confesses to Kevin that while buying lingerie for Leslie he had sexual intercourse with the saleswoman. | Billy and Wendy get drunk together and Wendy reveals that she is a virgin.

Billy urges Alec to make up with Leslie but Leslie declares that she does not want to date anyone for a while. Alec and Kevin make up and the group decides to get brunch. However, they decide not to go to St. Elmo's bar and instead choose Houlihan's because there are \"not so many kids\" there.","m_cast":"Emilio Estevez as Kirby \"Kirbo\" Keager, a law student and waiter at St. Elmo's Bar, and Kevin's roommate. | Andrew McCarthy as Kevin Dolenz, a writer with a sullen streak. | Rob Lowe as Billy Hicks, a saxophonist \"frat boy\" and reluctant husband and father. | Judd Nelson as Alec Newbury, a yuppie pursuing a career in politics. | Ally Sheedy as Leslie Hunter, another yuppie, who wants to pursue a career as an architect. | Demi Moore as Julianna \"Jules\" Van Patten, an investment banker and the \"party girl\" of the group. | Mare Winningham as Wendy Beamish, a welfare clerk from a wealthy family and devoted to helping others. | Andie MacDowell as Dale Biberman, a hospital intern and the object of Kirby's affection.","m_reception":"David Denby called Schumacher \"brutally untalented\" and said that \"nobody over the moral age of fifteen\" will like the work of the Brat Pack actors in the film:[5] | \"St. Elmo's Fire isn't drama, it's gossip, and peculiarly early-adolescent gossip— a movie designed to be picked apart on the telephone. The turbidly self-important treatment of these vacuous college graduates, each one a 'type', is like a TV sitcom without jokes. St. Elmo's Fire is so depressing a portent of Hollywood's teen sycophancy because it not only devotes itself to stupid kids, it accepts their view of the world without any real criticism....The sole survivor of the general disaster is Ally Sheedy, who manages to make something charming out of the yup petulance.\" | According to Janet Maslin, \"In the realm of films about close-knit bands of school friends, St. Elmo's Fire falls midway between The Big Chill and The Breakfast Club. Its characters are old enough to enjoy the first flushes of prosperity, but still sufficiently youthful to keep their self-absorption intact. But soon enough, they will be forced to give up their late-night carousing at a favorite bar and move on to more responsible lives. In the film's terms, which are distinctly limited, this will mean finding a more sedate hangout and learning to go there for brunch....St. Elmo's Fire is most appealing when it simply gives the actors a chance to flirt with the camera, and with one another. When it attempts to take seriously the problems of characters who are spoiled, affluent and unbearably smug, it becomes considerably less attractive.\"[6] | St. Elmo's Fire holds a 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 14 positive reviews out of 30.[7] | Rob Lowe won a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his work in this film.[8] | In a 2015 restrospective review, Justin Gerber of Consequence of Sound said that he was \"prepared to say it’s the worst movie of all time, with all the necessary stipulations lined up and accounted for,\"[9] going on to criticize the characters, plot, set, direction, and even score.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Joel Schumacher","m_produced_by":"Lauren Shuler Donner","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Rob Lowe | Demi Moore | Emilio Estevez | Ally Sheedy | Judd Nelson | Mare Winningham | Andrew McCarthy | Martin Balsam | Andie MacDowell","m_music_by":"David Foster","m_cinematography":"Stephen H.
