However, Szifron thought that grouped they would have more impact so he decided to \"reduce the conflicts to its minimum and find their climaxes.\"[8] Often described as a black humor film, Szifron stressed the stories were not planned as comedies but rather as a thriller or as a drama depending on the part;[6] in fact \"they begin as dramas. The humor is a consequence of what these characters feel in a very dramatic situation.\"[9] | Although very different, all stories \"are vital organs of the same body\" that sustain the film[10] and \"together [they] are more robust and make a larger universe\".[8] Anyway, the director said the film strength is not in the connection the accounts have. He asserted that \"they are independent stories, with separate independent characters and conflicts\".[8] Szifron explained that it was because he was inspired by concept and jazz albums, and by the circus. For the albums, the tracks although a unity have their \"own identity\"; during a circus spectacle there are different acts that have value for different reasons but they are one all.[5] Szifron was also influenced by television anthology series Amazing Stories,[11] Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone,[9] as well as film New York Stories', and book Nine Stories.[11] | Despite the clear common theme of violence and vengeance,[12][13] what connects the accounts, according to the director, is \"the fuzzy boundary that separates civilization from barbarism, the vertigo of losing your temper, and the undeniable pleasure of losing control\".[14] This is explored through the concept that human beings have animalistic features. Szifron considers the main difference between human and animals is the capacity one has to restrain oneself as opposed to animals who are guided by their instincts. Humans \"have a fight or flee mechanism, but it comes with a very high cost. Most of us live with the frustration of having to repress oneself, but some people explode. This is a movie about those who explode\". It deals with \"daily life\" aspects and \"is a movie about the desire for freedom, and how this lack of freedom, and the rage and anguish it produces, can cause us to run off the rails.\"[10] The main issue, according to Szifron, \"is the pleasure of reacting, the pleasure of reacting toward injustice.\"[9] | The film was a co-production between the Argentine Kramer & Sigman Films, Telefe Productions and Corner Contenidos and the Spanish company El Deseo, owned by Augustín and Pedro Almodóvar.[14][15][16] The film was shot between April and June 2013 and had locations in cities of Buenos Aires, Salta and Jujuy provinces.[14][8] The third act was especifically filmed on the route that connects Salta and Cafayate[17] because, as Szifron declared, \"the script required a desolate route with stunning scenery and degrees of sobriety\" to have a contrast between the violence of the fight and the beauty of the environment.[18] In the end of the filming, there was material for \"three different movies with different takes\" so Szifron went through a six-month process of editing the film, which was done in his house.[6] | Darín and Marínez were actors Zifron already wanted to work with and as such they were given the opportuinity to chose the role they wanted.[5]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Damián Szifron","m_produced_by":"Agustín Almodóvar | Pedro Almodóvar | Esther García | Matías Mosteirín | Felipe Photiades | Gerardo Rozín | Hugo Sigman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ricardo Darín | Oscar Martínez | Leonardo Sbaraglia | Érica Rivas | Rita Cortese | Julieta Zylberberg | Darío Grandinetti","m_music_by":"Gustavo Santaolalla","m_cinematography":"Javier Juliá","m_edited_by":"Pablo Barbieri Carrera | Damián Szifron","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Sogefilms","m_release_dates":"17 May 2014 (2014-05-17) (Cannes) | 21 August 2014 (2014-08-21) (Argentina) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"122 minutes[1]","m_country":"Argentina | Spain","m_language":"Spanish","m_budget":"$3.3 million[2]","m_box_office":"$27 million | Wild Tales (Spanish: Relatos salvajes) is a 2014 Argentine-Spanish black comedy anthology film composed of six standalone shorts, all written and directed by Damián Szifron, united by a common theme of violence and vengeance. | It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Ricardo Darín, Oscar Martínez, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Érica Rivas, Rita Cortese, Julieta Zylberberg, and Darío Grandinetti, and was co-produced by Agustín Almodóvar and Pedro Almodóvar.
