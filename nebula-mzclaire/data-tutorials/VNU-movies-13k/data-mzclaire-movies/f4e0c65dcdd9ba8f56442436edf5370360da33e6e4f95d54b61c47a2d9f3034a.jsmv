{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the early months of the Second World War, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine sends out merchant raiders to attack Allied shipping. The Royal Navy responds with hunting groups whose mission is to stop them. The group that finds the heavily armed pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee near South America is outgunned: Graf Spee is equipped with long-range 11-inch guns, while the British heavy cruiser Exeter has much lighter 8-inch guns, and the light cruisers Ajax and Achilles have 6-inch guns. Despite this, they go straight to the attack. | The British are led by Commodore Harwood (Anthony Quayle), with Captain Woodhouse (Ian Hunter) commanding flagship Ajax, Captain Bell (John Gregson) Exeter and Captain Parry (Jack Gwillim) Achilles. The British use their superior numbers to \"split her fire\" by attacking from different directions, but Graf Spee, under Captain Hans Langsdorff (Peter Finch), inflicts much damage on her foes; Exeter is particularly hard hit and is forced to retire. | However, Graf Spee sustains damage herself, and takes refuge in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay to make repairs. According to international law, the ship may remain at neutral harbour only long enough to make repairs for seaworthiness, not to refit her for battle. With reinforcements too far away, the British spread disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait, hoping to buy time: while they are initially demanding that the Uruguayan authorities send the Graf Spee out to sea within 24 hours, as the law dictates, they suddenly seem to lose interest and appear to tolerate her staying at anchor in Montevideo for as long as required. This is a bluff intended to make the Germans believe that more British warships are on the way, when none are. Taken in by this ruse, Langsdorff takes his ship out with a skeleton crew aboard, and as she heads down the River Plate for the open sea, he orders her scuttled.","m_cast":"Peter Finch as Captain Hans Langsdorff, Admiral Graf Spee | Bernard Lee as Captain Patrick Dove, MS Africa Shell | Andrew Cruickshank as Captain William Stubbs,[2] SS Doric Star | Peter Dyneley as Captain John Robison,[3] SS Newton Beech | Anthony Quayle as Commodore (later Rear-Admiral) Henry Harwood, HMS Ajax | Ian Hunter as Captain Charles Woodhouse, HMS Ajax | Patrick Macnee as Lieutenant Commander Ralph Medley,[4] HMS Ajax | John Gregson as Captain Frederick \"Hookie\" Bell, HMS Exeter (Gregson served in the Royal Navy during the War) | John Le Mesurier as the Chaplain of HMS Exeter | Jack Gwillim as Captain Edward Parry, HMS Achilles (Gwillim served 20 years in the Royal Navy, rising to the rank of Commander) | Lionel Murton as Mike Fowler, American radio reporter in Montevideo | Christopher Lee as Manolo, bar owner in Montevideo harbour | Edward Atienza as Pop, Mike Fowler's gaucho assistant | April Olrich as Dolores (singing voice by Muriel Smith) | Anthony Bushell as Eugen Millington-Drake, the British Minister in Uruguay | Michael Goodliffe as Captain Henry McCall,[5] British Naval Attaché in Buenos Aires | Peter Illing as Dr Alberto Guani, Uruguayan Foreign Minister | William Squire as Ray Martin, British SIS agent in Montevideo | John Chandos as Dr Otto Langmann, the German Minister in Uruguay | Douglas Wilmer as M.

They decided they couldn't afford to take the time from their schedules unless it was a working holiday, and used the trip to research the defeat of the Admiral Graf Spee. They came across the \"hook\" for their story when one of the surviving British naval officers gave Pressburger a copy of Captain Patrick Dove's book I Was A Prisoner on the Graf Spee, which became the basis of the human story of the film.[7] | Principal photography began on 13 December 1955, the sixteenth anniversary of the battle. The HMS Ajax and River Plate Association reportedly sent a message to the producers: \"Hope your shooting will be as successful as ours\". Location shooting for the arrival and departure of the Graf Spee took place at the port of Montevideo, using thousands of locals as extras.[7] However, the scenes showing Graf Spee sailing from Montevideo were shot in the Grand Harbour at Valletta in Malta, and the launch taking McCall out to HMS Ajax was filmed in Gozo harbour on Malta's northern island.[citation needed] | The Battle of the River Plate was shot in VistaVision, a wide screen orthographic process using a horizontal film feed. | Two songs written by composer Brian Easdale were used in the film, \"Dolores' Song\" and \"Rio de la Plata\". Both were acted by April Olrich as \"Dolores\", with singing voice dubbed by Muriel Smith.[8]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Powell Emeric Pressburger","m_produced_by":"Michael Powell Emeric Pressburger","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"David Farrar","m_music_by":"Brian Easdale","m_cinematography":"Christopher Challis","m_edited_by":"Reginald Mills","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Rank Film Distributors Ltd.","m_release_dates":"29 October 1956 (1956-10-29) (Royal Film Performance) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"119 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English | The Battle of the River Plate (aka in the United States as Pursuit of the Graf Spee) is a 1956 Technicolor British war film in VistaVision by the writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
