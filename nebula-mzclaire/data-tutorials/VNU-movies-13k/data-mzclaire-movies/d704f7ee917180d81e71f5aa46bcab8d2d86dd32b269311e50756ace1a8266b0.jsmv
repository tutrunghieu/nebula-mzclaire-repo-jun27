{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In December 2001, Ethan Miller (Gordon-Levitt) loses both of his parents in a car accident. Since that time, Isaac Greenberg (Rogen) and Chris Roberts (Mackie), Ethan's best friends, resolve to spend every Christmas Eve with Ethan. Along the way, the friends learn of the Nutcracker Ball, a tremendous, invite-only Christmas Eve party. Unable to find the party, the friends continue with their tradition. In 2015, the friends decide to end the tradition. Chris has become a famous football player, and Isaac is married, with a baby on the way. Privately, Chris and Isaac worry that Ethan, a struggling musician working at a hotel, is not ready for the tradition to end. | At the hotel, Ethan finds and steals invitations to the Nutcracker Ball. Later, at Isaac's house, Ethan presents the invitations to his friends. Prior to leaving, Betsy (Bell), Isaac's wife, gives him drugs to use during the evening, since he's been so supportive. The friends leave to follow their usual tradition, with the intention to go to the party afterward. Along the way, Chris, in an attempt to impress his teammates, purchases weed from their former high school dealer, Mr. Green (Shannon). While making the purchase, Mr. Green shares the weed with Chris, calling it the present. While at a karaoke bar, the friends run into Diana (Caplan), who recently broke up with Ethan for refusing to be serious, and Diana's friend Sarah (Kaling). The friends learn that Diana and Sarah will be at the Nutcracker Ball, as well. While at the bar, Isaac begins to be negatively affected by the drugs he's taken, resulting in making a video phone message admitting that he's terrified of having a child. Chris also has his weed stolen by a supposed fan (Glazer) who is a Christmas-hating thief. | Needing more weed, the guys contact Mr. Green again, who meets them at Chris' mother's (Toussaint) house. This time, Isaac meets Mr. Green, and is given weed showing him the future, involving his daughter being a stripper, and his wife blaming him for it. The friends end up having dinner, cooked by Chris' mother, who encourages Ethan to make up with Diana. During dinner, Isaac realizes that he accidentally switched phones with Sarah. | While trying to find Isaac's phone, the same thief steals Chris' weed again. The three friends split up, as Chris wants his weed back, Isaac wants his phone, and Ethan wants to go to the party. Chris fails to regain his weed, after getting a lesson on valuing his true friends from the thief. Isaac, hallucinating from the mixture of drugs he keeps consuming, makes a fool of himself after running into his wife and her family attending Midnight Mass. Ethan ends up beaten by two drunk pub-crawling Santas, after trying to defend the spirit of Christmas. | Upon meeting back at a subway station, the tension between the friends explodes. Ethan reveals that he and Isaac know that Chris' sudden success and popularity is due to steroids, and Chris reveals that he and Isaac think that Ethan is lost and making excuses for himself. | Despite their revelations, the three friends still go to the Nutcracker Ball. Upon arriving, Chris learns that his teammates didn't really need the weed he struggled to obtain, and they're also making fun of him for a video shot of him earlier, with his friends. Isaac retrieves his phone, and learns that Sarah didn't reveal the embarrassing video message he recorded. Ethan finds Diana and, in an improvised moment, proposes to her in front of the entire party. While she accepts publicly, in private she declines, saying she only said yes because he put her on the spot, and thinks that the only reason why he proposed is because he's afraid of losing his friends. | In shame, Ethan goes to the roof, where he sees Mr. Green. Mr. Green reveals that he created and has hosted the Nutcracker Ball since its inception. Mr. Green shares weed with Ethan, calling it the past. Ethan experiences a memory of his friends initiating their yearly ritual. Ethan rejoins his friends, who've been thrown out of the party after an altercation with Chris' teammates. | As morning dawns, the friends reconcile, just as Isaac receives a message from Betsy that she is in labor. Rushing to the hospital, in Mr. Green's conveniently available car, the friends discover that it was a false alarm. Isaac shows his wife the video, who admits afterward that she's relieved that he's also scared about raising their daughter. The trio spend Christmas at Isaac's house, after which Chris has dinner with his mother and admits to his steroid use. Ethan goes to Diana's house, where he apologizes for how he acted and for not being ready to get serious. Diana admits she missed Ethan and accepts his request to finally meet her parents, signaling his readiness to be serious. | One year later, the guys and their loved ones spend Christmas together, and are revealed to be happy, and still friends. Isaac's baby can't sleep, so the guys serenade her. It's shown that the story was all told from a book read by Santa, who is revealed to be the father of Mr. Green.","m_cast":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt[5] as Ethan Miller | Seth Rogen[5] as Isaac Greenberg[6] | Anthony Mackie[7] as Chris Roberts | Lizzy Caplan[8] as Diana, Ethan's ex- girlfriend | Jillian Bell[9] as Betsy Greenberg, Isaac's wife | Michael Shannon[10] as Mr. Green | Mindy Kaling[10] as Sarah | Lorraine Toussaint[11] as Mrs. Roberts, Chris's mother | Jason Mantzoukas[12] as Bad Santa #1 | Jason Jones[12] as Bad Santa #2 | Ilana Glazer[13] as Rebecca Grinch | Nathan Fielder[10] as Joshua | Tracy Morgan as the Narrator/Santa Claus | Randall Park as Ethan's boss | Helene York as Cindy | Aaron Hill as Tommy Owens | Baron Davis as himself | James Franco as himself | Miley Cyrus as herself","m_reception":"The Night Before grossed $43 million in North America and $9.3 in other territories for a worldwide total of $52.4 million, against a budget of $25 million.[4] | In North America, The Night Before opened alongside The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 and Secret in Their Eyes on November 20, 2015.
