{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film follows big band leader Glenn Miller (1904–1944) (James Stewart) from his early days in the music business in 1929 through to his 1944 death when the airplane he was flying in was lost over the English Channel during World War II. Prominent placement in the film is given to Miller's courtship and marriage to Helen Burger (June Allyson), and various cameos by actual musicians who were colleagues of Miller. | Several turning points in Miller's career are depicted with varying degrees of verisimilitude, including: the success of an early jazz band arrangement; his departure from the Broadway pit and sideman work to front a band of his own; the failure of his first band on the road; and the subsequent re-forming of his successful big band and the establishment of the “Miller Sound” as typified by “Moonlight Serenade”. Also depicted is Miller’s international success touring his band in support of the Allies in World War II. | There are several anachronisms in the picture. When the military band led by Miller is playing in front of General \"Hap\" Arnold, a B-29 bomber is in the background. The marching troops are desegregated, which didn't happen until 1948.","m_cast":"James Stewart as Glenn Miller (Trombone dubbed by Glenn Miller and Trummy Young) | June Allyson as Helen Burger Miller | Harry Morgan as Chummy MacGregor (billed as Henry Morgan) | Charles Drake as Don Haynes | George Tobias as Si Shribman | Barton MacLane as Gen.
