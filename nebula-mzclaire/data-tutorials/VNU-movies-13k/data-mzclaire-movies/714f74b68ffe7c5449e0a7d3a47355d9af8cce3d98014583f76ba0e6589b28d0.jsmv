{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Will, Neil and Jay's girlfriends have all broken up with them since the events of the last film, and Simon is unhappy with his girlfriend Lucy, who has become obsessive and abusive. Simon and Will are depressed and ostracised at university; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in Australia. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular night club, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club they find that Jay in fact only works as a toilet attendant, while Will meets Katie, an old friend from his private school days, who is backpacking, and she persuades him to join her. | The next day, the four travel to a youth hostel in Byron Bay, as Will wants to follow Katie there. He attempts to become friends with one of the backpackers, Ben, but is unsuccessful when the backpackers quickly deduce that he is a tourist, rather than a \"traveller\". Will struggles to fit in with the 'spiritual' activities of the travellers and discovers that Katie is seeing multiple people at once, launching him into one of his foul-mouthed tirades towards them, which leads Katie into having sex with Ben. | The boys and the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane is working on a stud farm in the remote settlement of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol in the middle of the desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her. | The four boys decide to travel to Vietnam in a montage during the film's credits. As they return to England, Neil begins a relationship with one of the travellers while Will's mother reveals that she and Gilbert are engaged. Will attempts to run back to the plane, but is wrestled to the ground by security.","m_cast":"Daisy Ridley's scenes were cut from the final version.[4][10]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Although originally intended as an unambiguous ending to the television series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over the possibility of a sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors.[11] Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that \"if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements ... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed.\"[12] Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted \"we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go back and see it more than once – and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people\".[13] The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.[13] | Iain Morris received inspiration for the film from his own experiences as a high school exchange student on Australia's Gold Coast, describing it as \"a place where people go to get drunk, pick some fruit and get drunk again\".[14] | On 21 August 2012, it was announced that a sequel was in early stages of pre-production.[15] On 8 November, it was announced by series creators Morris and Beesley that a script was being written and it was at \"version 0.5\"[16] On 1 May 2013, it was announced that, although nothing had been signed, a sequel was in the planning stage possibly set in Australia and to be released sometime in 2014.[17][18] | On 2 August 2013, the sequel was officially confirmed for release in August 2014.[19][20] The series' Facebook page revealed on 15 March 2014 that the sequel would be released on 6 August 2014.[3] | On 9 May 2014, a teaser trailer was released, in which the characters drive through the Outback and call an Aborigine a \"fire wanker\".[21] A second trailer, this time full length, was released on The Inbetweeners official Facebook page on 18 June, showing more of the storyline.[22] | Filming began in Australia on 7 December 2013,[24][25] before moving to the UK in January 2014.[26][27] Part of the film was shot in Marree, South Australia, an isolated Outback settlement without mobile reception or Internet.[23] | Ben Palmer, the director of the first Inbetweeners film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film Man Up, so Morris and Beesley directed The Inbetweeners 2.[28] Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and nervous about the direction of Morris and Beesley due to their lack of experience in the position.[13] | Morris had considered filming the Australian scenes in South Africa due to the comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor.[13] While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey.[13] During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley thought that he was having a heart attack, which was in reality indigestion from chips and lager.[13] Beesley considered it \"the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film\".[13] The water park scenes were filmed at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, which Thomas described as \"some quite challenging scenes\".[14] | When asked whether he ever felt averse to any material in the film due to perceived offence, Morris said that the crew's attitude was \"let’s shoot everything, push it, and then if it feels like too much when we’re watching it, we can always pull it back in the editing room\".[14]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Damon Beesley | Iain Morris","m_produced_by":"Spencer Millman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Simon Bird","m_music_by":"David Arnold | Michael Price","m_cinematography":"Ben Wheeler","m_edited_by":"William Webb","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Entertainment Film Distributors","m_release_dates":"6 August 2014 (2014-08-06) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$63.8 million[2] | The Inbetweeners 2 is a 2014 British comedy film and sequel to The Inbetweeners Movie (2011), which is based on the E4 sitcom The Inbetweeners.
