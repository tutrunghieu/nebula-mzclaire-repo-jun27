{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Deep in his secret underwater laboratory, teenage mad scientist Menlo Schwartzer plots to rid the beaches of his greatest enemies: surfers. Having been driven to revenge following a cruel practical joke gone awry, Menlo concocts an addictive chemical agent which turns its drinkers into mutated, garbage-ingesting zombie punks. With the reluctant help of his girlfriend Sparkle and a pair of greedy, cigar-chomping soda businessmen, Menlo distributes the chemical under the guise of \"Buzzz Cola\", and one by one begins to build an army of brainless zombie slaves to do his bidding. | After several of their friends fall victim to Buzzz Cola, airheaded surfer dudes Chuck and Bob begin to piece together the parts of Menlo's evil scheme. Finding no help from their spaced-out parents or the bumbling efforts of the local police force, the two enlist the services of their eccentric science teacher and vow to stop Menlo for good, or else they will not be able to compete in the big surf contest this weekend.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Randall M.

Badat and starring Eddie Deezen, Linda Kerridge, Eric Stoltz, Jeffrey Rogers and Peter Isacksen. The plot revolves around Menlo Schwartzer, a maniacal mad scientist who creates a chemically altered soft drink which turns its drinkers into mutant zombie punks as part of a diabolical scheme to rid the beaches of surfers. | Surf II is a contemporary parody of 1960s-style beach party films, mixing elements of the horror, science fiction, surf and teen film genres.[1] Despite what the title implies, there was never a Surf I. Surf II was marketed with a number of subheadings, the most common of which was in fact Surf II: The End of the Trilogy.[2] Although the film was received negatively by critics upon release and has never been officially released on DVD, it has since been rediscovered in recent years on VHS and YouTube, and is now considered a cult film. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b Guarisco, Donald. \"Surf 2 > Review - AllMovie\".
