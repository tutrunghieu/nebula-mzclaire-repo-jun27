{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"When a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C., the U. S. Army quickly encircles the spaceship. A humanoid (Michael Rennie) emerges, announcing that he has come in peace. As he advances, he unexpectedly opens a small cylindrical device and is shot by a nervous soldier who thinks it's a weapon. A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the army's deployed weapons with an energy ray. The alien orders the robot, Gort, to stop. He explains that the broken device was a gift for the President, which would have enabled him \"to study life on the other planets\". | The wounded alien is taken to Walter Reed Hospital, where he reveals his name: Klaatu. After surgery, the wound is quickly healed by a salve Klaatu brought with him. Meanwhile, the military attempts to enter his saucer, but finds it impenetrable; Gort stands outside, silent and unmoving. | Klaatu tells the President's secretary, Mr. Harley (Frank Conroy), that he has come with a message that must be delivered to all the world's leaders simultaneously. Harley tells him that such a meeting in the current political climate is impossible. Klaatu suggests that he be allowed to go among humans to better understand their \"unreasoning suspicions and attitudes\". Harley rejects the proposal and leaves Klaatu under guard. | Klaatu escapes and lodges at a boarding house as \"Mr. Carpenter\", the name on the dry cleaner's tag on the suit he \"borrowed\". Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray). The next morning, Klaatu listens to the boarders' speculations about why the alien has come to Earth. | While Helen and her boyfriend Tom Stephens (Hugh Marlowe) go out, Klaatu babysits Bobby. The boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father's grave in Arlington National Cemetery; Klaatu learns that most of those buried there were killed in wars. The two visit the Lincoln Memorial, then the heavily guarded spaceship. While at the Lincoln Memorial, Klaatu asks Bobby who is the greatest living person; Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), who also lives in the capital. Bobby takes Klaatu to Barnhardt's home, but the professor is absent. Klaatu adds a mathematical equation to a problem on Barnhardt's blackboard and leaves his contact information with the suspicious housekeeper. | That evening a government agent escorts Klaatu to see Barnhardt. Klaatu briefly explains that the people of the other planets have safety concerns now that humanity has developed rockets and a rudimentary form of atomic power. Klaatu declares that if his message is ignored \"Earth will be eliminated\". Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the spaceship; he then suggests that Klaatu give a demonstration of power without harming anyone or destroying anything. Klaatu returns to his spaceship that night, unaware that Bobby has followed him. Bobby sees Gort knock out two soldiers on guard duty and \"Mr. Carpenter\" enter the spaceship. | Bobby tells Helen and Tom what he saw, but they do not believe him until Tom takes a diamond he found in Klaatu's room to a jeweler, who informs him it is \"unlike any other on Earth\". Klaatu finds Helen at her workplace, and they take an empty service elevator which abruptly stops precisely at noon. Klaatu reveals his identity, and the reason for coming to Earth then asks for her help. He has neutralized all electricity everywhere except where human safety would be compromised, such as hospitals and aircraft in flight. | After exactly 30 minutes, the power blackout ends, after which the manhunt for Klaatu quickly intensifies. When Tom informs the military of his suspicions, Helen breaks up with him. Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to Barnhardt's home. En route, he tells her that should anything happen to him, she must go to Gort and say these words: \"Klaatu barada nikto\". Klaatu's taxi is spotted and hemmed in by army vehicles; he makes a break for it and is gunned down. Helen quickly heads to the saucer. Gort disintegrates both army sentries, and advances on her. When Helen utters Klaatu's three words, the robot carries her into the saucer, then leaves to retrieve Klaatu's body from a precinct jail cell. Later, Gort revives Klaatu, and he explains to Helen that his revival is only temporary, that the power of life and death is \"reserved for the Almighty Spirit\". | Klaatu and Helen emerge from the spaceship where Barnhardt's scientists have assembled. Klaatu pointedly tells them that the people of Earth have a choice. They can join the other planets in peace, but should they threaten to extend their violence into space, \"this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. [...] We shall be waiting for your answer\". Klaatu and Gort then leave as they came.","m_cast":"Cast notes Well-known broadcast journalists of their time, H. V. Kaltenborn, Elmer Davis, Drew Pearson, and Gabriel Heatter, appeared and/or were heard as themselves in cameo roles. [Note 1] Spencer Tracy and Claude Rains were originally considered for the part of Klaatu.[8][9]","m_reception":"The Day the Earth Stood Still was well received by critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1951.[23][24][25][26] Variety praised the film's documentary style and wrote that \"the yarn is told interestingly enough and imbued with sufficient science-fiction lures and suspense so that only seldom does its moralistic wordiness get in the way ... Cast, although secondary to the story, works well.\"[19][27] Harrison's Reports wrote: \"Very good! It is by far the best of the science-fiction pictures yet produced. It holds one's interest undiminished from start to finish and, although the theme is admittedly fantastic, one is made to feel as if he is seeing a real-life occurrence because of the expert handling of the subject matter and the extremely fine special effects work.\"[28] The Los Angeles Times praised the film's seriousness, though it also found \"certain subversive elements\".[19] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote a dismissive review, however, calling the film \"tepid entertainment\" and describing Gort as \"oddly unmenacing.\"[29] | The Day the Earth Stood Still was moderately successful when released, accruing US$1,850,000 in distributors' domestic (U. S. and Canada) rentals, making it the year's 52nd biggest earner.[30] [Note 2] | The Day the Earth Stood Still earned more plaudits overseas: the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave the filmmakers a special Golden Globe Award for \"promoting international understanding\". Bernard Herrmann's score also received a nomination at the Golden Globes.[31] The French magazine Cahiers du cinéma was also impressed, with Pierre Kast calling it \"almost literally stunning\" and praising its \"moral relativism\".[19] | The Day the Earth Stood Still is ranked seventh in Arthur C. Clarke's list of the best science fiction films of all time, just above Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which Clarke himself co-wrote.[citation needed] | The Day the Earth Stood Still holds a 94% \"Certified Fresh\" rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[32]","m_production":"Producer Julian Blaustein set out to make a film under the working titles of Farewell to the Master and Journey to the World that illustrated the fear and suspicion that characterized the early Cold War and Atomic Age. He reviewed more than 200 science fiction short stories and novels in search of a storyline that could be used, since this film genre was well suited for a metaphorical discussion of such grave issues. Studio head Darryl F. Zanuck gave the go-ahead for this project, and Blaustein hired Edmund North to write the screenplay based on elements from Harry Bates's 1940 short story \"Farewell to the Master\". The revised final screenplay was completed on February 21, 1951. Science fiction writer Raymond F. Jones worked as an uncredited adviser.[14] | The set was designed by Thomas Little and Claude Carpenter. They collaborated with the noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright for the design of the spacecraft. Paul Laffoley has suggested that the futuristic interior was inspired by Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters, completed in 1936. Laffoley quotes Wright and his attempt in designing the exterior: \"... to imitate an experimental substance that I have heard about which acts like living tissue. If cut, the rift would appear to heal like a wound, leaving a continuous surface with no scar\".[15] | Principal outdoor photography for The Day the Earth Stood Still was shot on the 20th Century Fox sound stages and on its studio back lot (now located in Century City, California), with a second unit shooting background plates and other scenes in Washington D.C. and at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. The shooting schedule was from April 9 to May 23, 1951. The primary actors never traveled to Washington for the making of the film. Robert Wise indicated in the DVD commentary that the War Department refused participation in the film based on a reading of the script. The military equipment shown, however, came from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment then stationed at Ft. Meade which supplied the vehicles, equipment and soldiers for the segments depicting Army operations.[16] One of the tanks in the film bears the \"Brave Rifles\" insignia of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.[17] | The robot Gort, who serves Klaatu, was played by Lock Martin, who worked as an usher at Grauman's Chinese Theater and stood seven feet tall. Not used to being in such a confining, heat-inducing costume, he worked carefully when wearing the two oversize, laced-up-the-front or -back, foamed neoprene suits needed for creating the illusion on screen of a seamless metallic Gort. Wise decided that Martin's on-screen shooting time would be limited to half hour intervals, so Martin, with his generally weak constitution, would face no more than minor discomfort. These segments, in turn, were then edited together into film's final print.[18] | In a commentary track on DVD, interviewed by fellow director Nicholas Meyer, the director Robert Wise stated that he wanted the film to appear as realistic and believable as possible, in order to drive home the motion picture's core message against armed conflict in the real world. Also mentioned in the DVD's documentary interview was the original title for the movie, \"The Day the World Stops\". Blaustein said his aim with the film was to promote a \"strong United Nations\".[19] | The music score was composed by Bernard Herrmann in August 1951, and was his first score after he moved from New York to Hollywood. Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two theremin electronic instruments (played by Dr. Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure), two Hammond organs, a large studio electric organ, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, marimba, tam-tam, two bass drums, three sets of timpani, two pianos, celesta, two harps, one horn, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas.[20] Herrmann's notable advances in film scoring included Unison organs, tubas, piano, and bass drum, staggered tritone movement, and glissando in theremins, as well as exploitation of the dissonance between D and E-flat and experimentation with unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques. By using the theremin, Herrmann made one of music's first forays into electronic music, one year before Karlheinz Stockhausen and three years before Edgard Varèse, something that was overlooked by the classical elite.[21]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Farewell to the Master 1940 novel  by Harry Bates","m_directed_by":"Robert Wise","m_produced_by":"Julian Blaustein","m_screenplay_by":"Edmund H.
