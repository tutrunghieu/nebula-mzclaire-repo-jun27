Her father is mild-mannered foot doctor, Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks). When the two families meet for dinner, Peyser stumbles on to Steve Tobias' secret operation as Tobias tries to set up a deal to sell a Russian submarine, the Olga, to an arms smuggler in France as a bait. As Peyser's incidental involvement increases, he is suspected by the FBI of being part of a seemingly malicious deal. Dragged kicking and screaming, Peyser decides he does not want to be involved in the deal or with Tobias' family. The two fathers-in-law end up dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and stealing jets together as they attempt to avoid capture by the FBI.","m_cast":"Michael Douglas as Steve Tobias | Albert Brooks as Jerry Peyser | Ryan Reynolds as Mark Tobias | Lindsay Sloane as Melissa Peyser | Robin Tunney as Angela Harris | Maria Ricossa as Katherine Peyser | Candice Bergen as Judy Tobias | David Suchet as Jean-Pierre Thibodoux | Vladimir Radian as Cherkasov | Michael Bodnar as Cherkasov's Bodyguard | Boyd Banks as Patient | Susan Aceron as Nurse | Chang Tseng as Quan Le | Tamara Gorski as Yadira | Matt Birman as Agent at Restaurant | A.
