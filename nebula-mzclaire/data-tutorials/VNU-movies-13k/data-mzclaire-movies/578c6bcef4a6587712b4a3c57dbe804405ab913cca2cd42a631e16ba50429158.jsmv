The New York Times said \"in its worst moments, [the film] is exploitative, with the detective flashing gruesome photos of tortured women at Ann. More often, it is so loopy it should have been played for laughs.\"[2] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C- grade.[3] Los Angeles Times staff writer Peter Rainer called it \"a textbook thriller\" and stated \"Doug is so Too Good to Be True that, when the inevitable murder makes its scheduled stop, [the audience] can sniff red herring a mile away. But then this movie has so many of them--including a hot-footed cop played by Anthony LaPaglia and a psychiatrist friend of Ann's played by Alan Alda--that [audiences] practically need a trawler to get through it.\"[4] It has a total of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes. | The film, while grossing over $11 million,[1] was not considered to be financially successful.[5][6]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Christopher Crowe","m_produced_by":"Martin Bregman Michael Bregman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Annabella Sciorra | Jamey Sheridan | Anthony La Paglia | Jill Clayburgh | John Leguizamo | Deborah Unger | Alan Alda","m_music_by":"Thomas Newman","m_cinematography":"Michael Chapman","m_edited_by":"Ray Hubley Bill Pankow","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"August 7, 1992","m_running_time":"103 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$11,124,511[1] | Whispers in the Dark is a 1992 American thriller about a psychiatrist whose patient's lover may or may not be a serial killer.
