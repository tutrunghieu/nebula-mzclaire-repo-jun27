But the jokes don't travel very well.\"[13] He gave the film one star out of a possible four.[14] The reviewers at the Washington Post were unimpressed: Rita Kempley called the film \"dumber-than-a-bowling-ball\" and questioned its mass appeal; Desson Howe noted that distributor Warner Bros. had made it a \"pre-processed legend\" regardless of merit.[15][16] The New York Times was more tempered, noting that though the film was \"an uneven series of sketches strung along an extended joke\", that the first time director Serious \"is a much more adept film maker than his loony plot suggests.\"[17] | The Los Angeles Times gave a favorable review, saying the film would appeal to younger audiences and that \"it's just about impossible to dislike a movie in which examples of the hero's pacifism include his risking his life to save kitties from being baked to death inside a pie.\"[18] Neil Jillett of Australia's The Age reviewed the film positively, noting that despite some \"directorial slackness\", the film was \"a lively work that is sophisticated and innocent, witty and farcical, satirical and unmalicious, intelligent but not condescending, full of concern with big issues but not arrogantly didactic, thoroughly Australian but not nationalistic.\"[19] Variety meanwhile thought that the film relied on the performance of Yahoo Serious, who they described \"exhibits a brash and confident sense of humor, endearing personality, and a fondness for sight gags.\"[20] | In the UK, William Russell for the Glasgow Herald described the film as trying \"too hard to be funny for its own good.\" Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 35% rating based on reviews from 31 critics.[citation needed] | Young Einstein grossed A$13,383,377 at the box office in Australia.[21] On release in Australia, it became the fifth biggest opening in Australian film history behind \"Crocodile\" Dundee and its sequel, Rocky IV and Fatal Attraction. It grossed A$1.26 million in the opening weekend, despite being released in only three states.[22] It was only the third film of 1988 to break the A$1 million barrier at the Australian box office.[22] Young Einstein became the tenth most successful film released at the Australian box office,[23] after being the second most successful Australian film ever on release after \"Crocodile\" Dundee.[24] | However, it was a box office disappointment in the United States, debuting at #8 on opening weekend after tepid reviews.[25] US distributor Warner Bros., hoping for similar crossover success as \"Crocodile\" Dundee, spent US$8 million on a major marketing push.[26] It continues to be regarded as as a flop.[27] It ended its US theatrical run at $11,536,599.[28] | The film has been released on DVD in region 1. The DVD is available in Australia by LA Entertainment.","m_production":"Serious first became interested in Albert Einstein when he was travelling down the Amazon River and saw a local wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a physicist on it.[2] The image was that of Einstein sticking out his tongue, taken by photographer Arthur Sasse.[3] | On returning from the Amazon, Serious adapted a previous screenplay called The Great Galute which he had written with David Roach. It was a story about an Australian who invents rock and roll. The two developed The Great Galute into Young Einstein.[4] | The film was created on an extremely low budget, so low that Serious sold his car to generate funds, cameras were borrowed,[5] and his mother cooked for the crew.[6] | Serious managed to get Australian Film Commission support for the movie. By March 1984, an hour of the film had been shot, partly by the AFC and partly by private investment.[7] Serious was then able to pre-sell the film to an American company, Film Accord, for $2 million. This enabled him to raise the film's original budget of $2.2 million.[8] The movie started filming again late in 1985 and went for seven weeks, from 23 September, taking place in Newcastle and Wollombi, near Cessnock in the Hunter Valley, with second unit at various locations throughout Australia. A 91-minute version of the film was entered in the 1986 AFI Awards where composer William Motzing won Best Music.[1][9] | In 1986, Film Accord sued the production to recover its distribution guarantee and the rushes, claiming the film delivered was not the one it had contracted to buy. The dispute was settled out of court.[7] | Serious was unhappy with his first version of the film.[10] Graham Burke from Roadshow saw it and became enthusiastic about its possibilities. Roadshow bought out Film Accord in March 1987, persuaded Warner Bros. to take on the film for international distribution outside Australia, and financed re-shooting, re-editing and re-scoring, resulting in an hour of new material (including a new ending) and new music score (including the addition of songs by bands such as Mental As Anything). This pushed the budget of the film up to $5 million. Warner Bros. contributed A$4 million to the full version of the film, and would go on to spend eight million on marketing the film in the United States alone.[6][11] | Serious' key collaborators in the movie were co-writer David Roach, co-producer Warwick Rodd and associate producer Lulu Pinkus. He has said it helped that they all shared the same vision for the movie which got them through the long production process.[10] | Serious refused to consider making a sequel to the film, as he stated in interviews that he was opposed to them in general.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Yahoo Serious","m_produced_by":"David Roach Warwick Ross Yahoo Serious","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Yahoo Serious | Odile Le Clezio | John Howard","m_music_by":"Martin Armiger Iva Davies William Motzing Maurie Sheldon Tommy Tycho Simon Walker Ken Francis","m_cinematography":"Jeff Darling","m_edited_by":"David Roach Amanda Robson Neil Thumpston Peter Whitmore","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"December 15, 1988 (Australia) 4 August 1989 (1989-08-04) (U.S.)","m_running_time":"91 minutes","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$5 million[1]","m_box_office":"A$13,383,377 (AUS) US$11,536,599 (US) | Young Einstein is an Australian comedy film directed by and starring Yahoo Serious, released in 1988.
