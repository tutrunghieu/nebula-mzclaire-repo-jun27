{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Mary Beth, a museum tour guide, takes a group of children on a tour of Mexican folk myths and legends. She tells them the story of the Mexican town of San Angel from the Book of Life, which holds every story in the world. | On San Angel's Day of the Dead festival, the spirits La Muerte, ruler of the Land of the Remembered; and Xibalba, ruler of the Land of the Forgotten, set a wager after seeing Manolo Sánchez and Joaquín Mondragon competing over a girl named María Posada. La Muerte bets that Manolo will marry María while Xibalba bets on Joaquín. If La Muerte wins, Xibalba can no longer interfere in mortal affairs. If Xibalba wins, he and La Muerte switch realms. However, Xibalba cheats by giving Joaquin his Medal of Everlasting Life, which grants the wearer invincibility. María frees a herd of pigs from being slaughtered, causing her to get enrolled in a boarding school in Spain. While saying their goodbyes, Manolo gives her a baby pig from earlier and she gives him a guitar engraved with \"Always play from the heart\" while Joaquin keeps her hat that flew off the train. | Years later, Manolo's musician dreams are suppressed by his father Carlos who trains him to become a famous bullfighter as with the rest of their family while Joaquín becomes the revered town hero with the Medal's aid. On the day of María's return, a celebration is held culminating in Manolo's first bullfight. Manolo defeats the bull but refuses to kill it, dismaying Carlos and the crowd but impressing María. That night, María is pressured by General Ramiro Posada, her father and the mayor of San Angel, to marry Joaquín so that he will stay and protect San Angel from the bandit Chakal, though she is conflicted by her feelings for Manolo. María and Manolo meet before dawn to profess their love for each other, but they are interrupted when Xibalba sends a two-headed snake to bite her once, rendering her unconscious. Devastated by María's assumed death, Manolo is tricked by Xibalba into being sent to the afterlife: the snake bites him twice, killing him. | At the Land of the Remembered, Manolo reunites with his mother Carmen and his illustrious deceased family members. They travel to La Muerte's castle to seek María, but discover Xibalba, who explains the bet to Manolo and that the snake put María in a coma, but killed him. When María awakens, she learns of Manolo's death and accepts Joaquín's proposal. Manolo, Carmen, and Manolo's grandfather Luis travel to the Cave of Souls to reach La Muerte. They meet the Candle Maker who oversees the lives of everybody in the living world. After seeing that Manolo's story in the Book of Life is blank and can be rewritten by Manolo's own actions, the Candle Maker takes them to the Land of the Forgotten. Manolo finds La Muerte and exposes the cheating to her. Furious at Xibalba, La Muerte lectures him before another deal is negotiated: Manolo's life will be returned if he completes a challenge Xibalba sets him. If he fails, Xibalba will rule both lands and Manolo will be forgotten. Thinking that Manolo's fear is bulls, Xibalba manifests every bull the Sanchez family ever fought, which merge into a giant one for Manolo to defeat. | In the living world, Chakal, who previously owned the Medal, leads his army to San Angel to find it. Chakal kills Carlos, who joins the deceased to watch Manolo fight. Manolo, realizing his fear is actually being himself, refuses to deliver the finishing blow again, instead singing an apology to the resentment-filled spirit asking it to forgive his family's actions, which it does by peacefully dissolving away. Impressed, the deities grant Manolo his life back and send him and his family's spirits to the living world to help defeat Chakal. Manolo is almost killed again when Chakal blows them both up, but is rescued by the Medal, which Joaquín pins on him. Joaquín returns it to Xibalba and resolves to be a hero by himself, while Manolo and María wed happily as Xibalba and La Muerte professes their love. | Back in the present as the children leave the museum, Mary Beth and the security guard shown earlier reveal themselves as La Muerte and Xibalba. The Candle Maker then tells the viewers to write their own story.","m_cast":"Diego Luna as Manolo Sánchez,[1] a torero with a guitar and two swords.

It played 59% under 10-years old while 31% of tickets sold were in 3D.[33] | In other territories, The Book of Life earned $8.58 million from 3,654 screens in 19 markets. The highest debuts came from Mexico ($3.84 million) and Brazil ($1.98 million).[31] In Mexico, the film was number two behind the local film Perfect Dictatorship.[34] | The Book of Life received generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 81%, based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's consensus reads \"The Book of Life's gorgeous animation is a treat, but it's a pity that its story lacks the same level of craft and detail that its thrilling visuals provide.\"[35] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[36] | Geoff Berkshire of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying \"Repping a major step forward for Dallas-based Reel FX Animation Studios (after their anemic feature bow on last year’s Free Birds), the beautifully rendered CG animation brings an unusually warm and heartfelt quality to the high-tech medium and emerges as the film’s true calling card.\"[37] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying \"The Book of Life is a visually stunning effort that makes up for its formulaic storyline with an enchanting atmosphere that sweeps you into its fantastical world, or in this case, three worlds.\"[38] Simon Abrams of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review, saying \"The Book of Life's hackneyed stock plot preaches tolerance while lamely reinforcing the status quo.\"[39] Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying \"Overflowing with hyperactive charm and a spectacular sea of colors, it showcases some of the most breathtaking animation we've seen this decade.\"[40] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"The dizzying, intricate imagery is so beautiful, and the Latin-inspired songs catchy enough that the overall effect is often enchanting.\"[41] Sara Stewart of The New York Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Just in time for Mexico’s Day of the Dead holiday comes this gloriously colorful animated musical, which almost (but not quite) makes up in visuals what it lacks in snappy dialogue.\"[42] Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film a B-, saying \"Ultimately, what drags The Book Of Life down is its insistence on trying to update an (original) folkloric story for a contemporary audience. In practice, this means adding some pop-cultural touches that only serve to take the viewer out of the fantastic setting.\"[43] | Michael Ordoña of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"The vibrant animated feature The Book of Life is a cheeky celebration of Mexican folklore with a solid cast, an irreverent sensibility and gorgeous visuals.\"[44] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"The Book of Life may use state-of-the-art animation, but it derives its strength from the wisdom of antiquity. It only looks new, but it's as old as life (and death) itself.[45] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"A visually stunning, funny movie that trusts children to deal with subject matter that many films don't: specifically, death.\"[46] Frank Lovece of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Funny without being frantic, seamlessly switching from dry humor to slapstick, it shows death as a part of life -- and, judging from a preview audience of very young tykes, does so in a gentle, delightful way.\"[47] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, saying \"This often beautiful and too-often moribund, if exhaustingly frenetic, feature tends to be less energetic than the dead people waltzing through it.\"[48] Conversely, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, saying \"The Book of Life juxtaposes overwrought visual imagery with an undernourished, familiar story - regrettable flaws in one of the few animated films to focus on Latino characters and the rich heritage of Mexican folk culture.\"[49] Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying \"Visually arresting but dramatically rote, The Book of Life at least introduces American kids to the Mexican holiday of Día de los Muertos and should score points with families looking for kid-friendly movies that reflect aspects of their Mexican cultural heritage.\"[50] | Calvin Wilson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying \"The Book of Life is a flawed but intriguing new chapter in animation.\"[51] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The Book of Life moves breezily from one scene to the next, keeping the pace brisk and rarely skipping a beat.\"[52] Laura Emerick of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Whether en ingles o en espanol, The Book of Life is a delight. In an animated universe cluttered with kung-fu pandas, ice princesses and video-game heroes, Gutierrez and del Toro have conjured up an original vision.\"[53] Tasha Robinson of The Dissolve gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying \"It’s all flawed, and distracted, and conceptually messy, prioritizing color over common sense and energy over consistency. But as an afternoon’s diversion for a handful of misbehaving kids—both within the movie, and within the movie theater—it’s authentically winning.\"[54] Michael Ordona of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review, saying \"There are no great surprises, no shocking reveals (except to the characters themselves). But there’s so much to appreciate along the way that it’s a real page-turner.\"[44] Kenji Fujishima of Slant Magazine gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Jorge R. Gutierrez subsumes the film's darker themes in a relentlessly busy farrago of predictable kids'-movie tropes and annoying attempts at hipness.\"[55] Ben Sachs of the Chicago Reader gave the film a negative review, saying \"This Pixar knockoff from 20th Century Fox is more imaginative than most, though like far too many of them, it's undone by a surfeit of glib one-liners and pop culture references.\"[56]","m_production":"The Book of Life was originally optioned by DreamWorks Animation in 2007, but never went beyond development because of \"creative differences\".[10] From there the film went to Reel FX,[11] with 20th Century Fox handling distribution rights. The film was initially given a release date of October 10, 2014;[12] however, this was eventually moved back by a week.[13] On October 16, 2013, it was announced that Channing Tatum, Zoe Saldana, Diego Luna and Christina Applegate would star as voice actors in the film.[8] | Jorge Gutierrez wanted to make the final animation look like the concept artwork saying: \"I saw every single one that comes out and my biggest heartbreak is that I see all this glorious art, and then the movie doesn't look like that! The mandate of this movie was: Our 'Art of' book is going to look exactly like the movie. And every artist poured their heart and soul into that idea.\"[14] Gutierrez did not permit his animation team to go on any research trips to Mexico, feeling that such trips often only covered very touristy aspects of the culture. Instead he had the team address any questions they had about the region to him.[15]","m_sequel":"Director Jorge Gutierrez revealed in an interview that one of the ideas for the next chapter in the story involves Joaquin and his relationship with his father. \"I had always imagined the first movie to be about Manolo, the second to be about Joaquín and the third one to be about Maria...I've always conceived it as a trilogy.\"[71]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jorge R.
