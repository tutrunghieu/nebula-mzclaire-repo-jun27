{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Josh Kovaks is the building manager of The Tower, a luxury apartment complex in New York City whose employees include concierge Charlie, who is expecting a child with Josh's sister; Enrique, a newly hired elevator operator; Lester, the doorman nearing retirement; Odessa, an immigrant maid from Jamaica; and receptionist Miss Iovenko, who is studying to become a lawyer. | One morning Josh sees Arthur Shaw, a wealthy Tower resident, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw was attempting to flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $2 billion in a Ponzi scheme. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide. After visiting Lester in hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw's insincere condolences enrage Josh and he smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh, Charlie, and Enrique are fired for the incident. | Josh meets Denham at a bar where she suggests that Shaw has concealed $20 million as a reserve, and that Josh should steal it. Josh, Charlie, Enrique, and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh conspire to find and steal the money from Shaw's assumed safe. They supplement their inexperience by enlisting Josh's childhood former friend Slide, a petty criminal, and Odessa, who has locksmith experience that can help open the safe. Charlie is later rehired as the Tower's new manager, and warns Josh to abandon the plan or he will inform the police. Subsequently, Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled for to attend court on Thanksgiving during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to avoid publicity, and that Shaw will be set free. Josh and his team decide to break into Shaw's apartment during the parade. | Slide attempts to betray the team by reaching the safe first, having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons. The team intercepts him at Shaw's apartment, and during the ensuing struggle they break down a false wall, revealing Shaw's empty safe. Slide and Fitzhugh struggle for Slide's gun; the gun goes off and the bullet hits the car, revealing gold underneath the Ferrari's paint. They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight. Josh finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's glove box. They use a window-washing platform to lower the car from the apartment into an empty apartment below before lowering it to the lobby on top of the elevator. As they reach the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, revealing the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse as part of the plan. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and rearrests him for violating his bail by not declaring the latter. | Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts on the condition that Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison for the rest of his life. | The team retrieves the car from its hiding place in Shaw's rooftop pool and send various parts of the car to Tower employees to compensate for their lost pensions. As Josh is led to his cell, a satisfied smile slowly forms on his face.","m_cast":"Ben Stiller as Josh Kovaks | Eddie Murphy as Slide | Casey Affleck as Charlie Gibbs | Alan Alda as Arthur Shaw | Matthew Broderick as Mr. Fitzhugh | Téa Leoni as Claire Denham | Michael Peña as Enrique Dev'reaux | Gabourey Sidibe as Odessa Montero | Judd Hirsch plays Mr. Simon, the building General Manager,[19] and Stephen Henderson plays Lester, the tower's retiring doorman.

Plus, who could have known that, in this period of time, the global financial markets would teeter on the verge of collapse and the villain in our story would pale in comparison to some very real ones on Wall Street? Truth remains stranger than fiction.\" | The idea for Tower Heist began development as early as 2005, when Murphy pitched a concept to producer Brian Grazer and Ratner concerning an all-star cast of black comedians including Chris Tucker, Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Tracy Morgan, and Martin Lawrence, as a group of disgruntled employees who plan to rob Donald Trump and Trump International Hotel and Tower.[25][26][27] The film was originally titled Trump Heist under this concept.[10] A script was developed by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage and over the course of the next five years, the script was rewritten by several writers including Russell Gewirtz, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Ted Griffin, Leslie Dixon, Noah Baumbach, and Jeff Nathanson, with the bulk of the work – and credit – going to Griffin and Nathanson.[28] | Rewrites of the script gradually moved away from the ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project. For Ratner however, the modified script reminded him of the Ocean's Eleven remake, a project he had developed but for which he was unavailable due to his commitment to directing Rush Hour 2.[3][27] | The project remained in development for a period of years but Ratner remained committed to the project, having enjoyed the heist films of the 1970s including The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The Hot Rock, and The Anderson Tapes,[29] turning down the opportunity to direct other films such as Horrible Bosses, which he instead produced.[30][31] Ratner would also claim that he wanted to work with Murphy, whom Ratner partially credited as inspiring his Rush Hour films.[29] As the script began to be finalized, Murphy was drawn back into the much-changed project after being informed of Stiller's participation, with Murphy being offered the role of Slide. Murphy rejoined as both a cast member and producer, alongside Grazer and Kim Roth.[3][29] In later October 2010, the film was finally scheduled for release, being given a November 4, 2011, release date.[32] | Feeling the original concept was too close to Ocean's Eleven,[12] Ratner attempted to recruit Rush Hour screenwriter Nathanson to perform additional work on the Tower Heist script, but at that time Nathanson was unavailable. Ratner instead hired Griffin, a writer on the Ocean's Eleven remake. Griffin \"brought the real motivation and the heart to the concept\", moving away from the premise of performing an ensemble heist on a rich Donald Trump-type,[12][27] and focusing instead on a group of blue-collar employees who take on a corrupt, thieving Bernard Madoff-like businessman who has embezzled their pensions.[12] Ratner enjoyed the pitch and brought it to Grazer who gave his approval.[27] After taking the script to Stiller and bringing him into the project, Ratner had Noah Baumbach perform specific rewrites for Stiller's character.[27] Nathanson then came aboard the project and performed the final rewrites to Griffin's screenplay in October 2010,[3][10][27] adding \"the obstacles, complexities and specificities of the characters.\"[5] | To help develop the script, the filmmakers and writers spoke with the resident managers of several high-profile New York hotels to learn of their experiences interacting with their clientele. This research gave Griffin the idea for Shaw's possessing a vehicle in his apartment, which Grazer and Ratner eventually decided would be a rare 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso which once belonged to Steve McQueen.[33] On his research, Nathanson said: | \"It was informative, to say the least, to speak with the people who work in these buildings. I interviewed everyone from doormen to housekeepers to building managers. There's a whole underworld to the New York building scene that exists in the basements that most people are unaware of. They make it all possible, and you just never see it. It's fascinating.\"[34] | Filming began on November 2010, taking place entirely in New York City[35] on a budget of $85 million ($75 million after tax rebates).[3][36] Production designer Kristi Zea visited several upscale hotels and high-rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw's penthouse. Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower. For Shaw's penthouse, Zea took inspiration from a top-floor apartment in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Central Park West in Columbus Circle.[37] Zea populated the apartment with an assortment of art pieces to represent Shaw's status, based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested. Zea decided to use modern-classic reproduction designs by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol.[38] Explaining her decision, Zea said \"These days, it seems wealthy people want to have wall power. They want to have art on their walls that means something and shows people, just like a car, that, 'I'm rich, I'm smart and I know what I'm doing.'\"[38] | Donald Trump allowed the production to use several of his own properties to portray the luxurious locales with the Trump International Hotel and Tower's being used for exterior shots of the tower.[38] Sections of the building were recreated on closed green screen sets for some of the film's visual effects.[39] A foot and car chase sequence was filmed on Central Park West and Columbus Avenue.[38] Some vehicle filming occurred on sound stages in Brooklyn.[40] The burglary itself takes place during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, requiring the crew to film parts of the actual parade itself, and then recreate the event one week later for further filming.[41] | For Shaw's Ferrari, it was decided that purchasing an actual model – of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1 million – would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, it was decided to paint the replicas bright red in order to create a lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.[42] | Sidibe and Murphy performed the only improvised scene, in which they are cracking a safe together.[12] Test screenings did not result in any scenes being cut from the film, with Ratner claiming that the theatrical version is his \"director's cut\".[12] However, he did remove scenes which he felt \"didn't fit\", or did not match the PG-13 rating the filmmakers were targeting.[12] | In post-production, Universal decided to film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy, however, refused to return unless he were paid a further $500,000 on top of his $7.5 million salary. The studio declined to pay the additional money and the scene was not shot.[43] | The soundtrack was composed by The Hangover's Christophe Beck. The Tower Heist Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on November 1, 2011, by Varèse Sarabande. It consists of 22 tracks with a runtime of 40 minutes.[44]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Brett Ratner","m_produced_by":"Brian Grazer | Eddie Murphy | Kim Roth","m_screenplay_by":"Ted Griffin | Jeff Nathanson","m_story_by":"Bill Collage | Adam Cooper | Ted Griffin","m_starring":"Ben Stiller | Eddie Murphy | Casey Affleck | Alan Alda | Matthew Broderick | Téa Leoni | Michael Peña | Gabourey Sidibe","m_music_by":"Christophe Beck","m_cinematography":"Dante Spinotti","m_edited_by":"Mark Helfrich","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures[1]","m_release_dates":"November 2, 2011 (2011-11-02) (United Kingdom) | November 4, 2011 (2011-11-04) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes[2]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$75~85 million[3][4]","m_box_office":"$152.9 million[4] | Tower Heist is a 2011 American heist comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson, based on a story by Bill Collage, Adam Cooper and Griffin. It was released on November 2, 2011 in the United Kingdom, with a United States release following two days later. Tower Heist follows Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller), Charlie Gibbs (Casey Affleck) and Enrique Dev'reaux (Michael Peña), employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of Wall Street businessman Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda). The group enlist the aid of criminal Slide (Eddie Murphy), bankrupt businessman Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) and another employee of the apartment building, Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe), to break into Shaw's apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agent in charge of his case, Claire Denham (Téa Leoni). | Tower Heist began development as early as 2005, based on an idea by Murphy that would star himself and an all-black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob Trump International Hotel and Tower. As the script developed and changed into an Ocean's Eleven–style caper, Murphy left the project. Ratner continued to develop the idea into what would eventually become Tower Heist, with Murphy later rejoining the production. Filming took place entirely in New York City on a budget of $75 million (after tax rebates), with several buildings provided by Donald Trump used to represent the eponymous tower. The film score was composed by Christophe Beck and released commercially on November 1, 2011. | The film received mixed reviews with much of the praise going to the cast, including Broderick, Leoni and Stiller. However, Murphy was repeatedly singled out by critics as the star of the film, with critics feeling that he displayed a welcome return to the comedic style of his early career. Much of the criticism received by the film was focused on the plot which was considered \"formulaic,\"[5] \"rushed,\"[6] \"dull\"[7] and \"laborious.\"[8] The film earned almost $153 million during its theatrical run. | Prior to release, the film was involved in a controversy over plans by Universal Pictures to release it for home viewing on video on demand to 500,000 Comcast customers, only three weeks after its theatrical debut. Concern over the implementation's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films to follow suit resulted in several theater chains' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead, forcing Universal to abandon the idea. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Tower Heist Production Notes\" (PDF).
