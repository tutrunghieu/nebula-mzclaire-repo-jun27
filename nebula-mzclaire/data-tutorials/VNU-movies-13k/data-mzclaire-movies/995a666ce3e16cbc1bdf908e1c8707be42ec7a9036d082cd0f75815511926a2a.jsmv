Viva Las Vegas also received the 1965 Laurel Award for runner-up in the category of the best musical of 1964. Ann-Margret was praised for her on screen chemistry with Elvis, as she nearly stole the film from him. | Some critics in 1964 were lukewarm about Viva Las Vegas, such as one for The New York Times, who wrote: \"Viva Las Vegas, the new Elvis Presley vehicle, is about as pleasant and unimportant as a banana split.\"[8] However, many others deduced the reasons why many members of the North American public liked the movie so much. Variety magazine stated in its review: \"Beyond several flashy musical numbers, a glamorous locale, and one electrifying auto race sequence, the production is a pretty trite and 'heavyhanded' affair\".[2] Critical reaction notwithstanding, Viva Las Vegas has become one of Elvis Presley's most popular and iconic films.","m_production":"In Great Britain, both the movie and its soundtrack were sold as Love In Las Vegas, since there was another, different movie called Viva Las Vegas that was being shown in British cinemas at the same time that Presley's was released. | The chemistry between the two stars[2] was quite real during the filming of Viva Las Vegas. Presley and Ann-Margret began an affair, and this received considerable attention from movie and music gossip columnists. This reportedly led to a showdown with Presley's worried girlfriend Priscilla Beaulieu. (Elvis and Priscilla married in 1967.) In her 1985 book Elvis and Me, Priscilla Presley describes the difficulties that she experienced when the gossip columnists erroneously \"announced\" that Ann-Margret and Presley had become engaged to be married. | In her memoirs, Ann-Margret refers to Elvis Presley as her \"soulmate\" and stated: \"We felt there was a need in 'The Industry' for a female Elvis Presley.\"[4] [5] | In addition, the filming of Viva Las Vegas reportedly produced unusually heated exchanges between the director, film veteran George Sidney, and Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who was not credited as a \"Technical Advisor\" in the film's credits. | The arguments reportedly concerned the amount of time and effort allotted by the cinematographer, Joseph Biroc, to the song and dance numbers that featured Ann-Margret, ostensibly on the orders of the director. These scenes in Viva Las Vegas include views of Ann-Margret's dancing taken from many different camera angles, the use of multiple movie cameras for each scene, and several retakes of each of her song-and-dance scenes. | David Winters from the original cast of West Side Story was the film's choreographer and was recommended by Ann-Margret for the job. This was Winters' first job as a choreographer on a feature film and Ann-Margret was his dance student at the time.[6] Due to the film going over budget, Parker would slash the budgets for all the remaining films in Presley's career. | \"Little Church of the West,\" the oldest Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, is the location used in the closing scene. | The scene where Presley sings Viva Las Vegas is performed in one single unedited shot—the only known example of such a technique in Presley's movie career.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"George Sidney","m_produced_by":"Jack Cummings | George Sidney","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Elvis Presley | Ann-Margret","m_music_by":"George E.
