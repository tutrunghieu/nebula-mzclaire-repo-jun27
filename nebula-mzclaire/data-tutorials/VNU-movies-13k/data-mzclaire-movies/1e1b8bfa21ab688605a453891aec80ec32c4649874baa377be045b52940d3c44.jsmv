{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins in black and white in November 1918 at the end of World War I. A private (Marvin), using his trench knife, kills a German soldier who was approaching with his arms raised and speaking in German. When he returns to his company's headquarters, the private is told that the \"war's been over for four hours.\" The 1st Division patch is shown in color. | The film then moves to November 1942, when the soldier, now a sergeant in the \"Big Red One\", leads his squad of infantrymen through North Africa, where they are initially fired on by a Vichy French general, who is then overpowered by his French troops who are loyal to Free France. Over the next two years the squad serves in campaigns in Sicily, where they are given intelligence by a peasant boy, and are fed by grateful women, Omaha Beach at the start of the Normandy Campaign, the liberation of France where they battle Germans inside a mental asylum, and the invasion of western Germany. | Throughout the film, the sergeant's German counterpart, Schroeder, participates in many of the same battles and displays a ruthless loyalty to Hitler and Germany. At different times he and the sergeant express the same sentiment that soldiers are killers but not murderers. | During the advance across northern France the squad crosses the same field where the sergeant killed the surrendering German at the start of the film, where a memorial now stands.[2] The following short conversation takes place: | The squad's final action in the war is the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. Shortly after this, the sergeant is in a forest at night, having just buried a young boy he had befriended after liberating the camp. Schroeder approaches, attempting to surrender, but the sergeant stabs him. His squad then arrives and informs him that the war ended \"about four hours ago.\" This time, as the squad walks away, Pvt. Griff (Mark Hamill) notices that Schroeder is still alive; the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life as they return to their encampment.","m_cast":"Lee Marvin – The Sergeant – A World War I veteran, he leads the squad through World War II. | Mark Hamill – Pvt.

He doesn't give us a lot of phony meaning, as if to justify the scope of the production. There aren't a lot of deep, significant speeches. In the ways that count, \"The Big Red One\" is still a B-movie – hard-boiled, filled with action, held together by male camaraderie, directed with a lean economy of action. It's one of the most expensive B-pictures ever made, and I think that helps it fit the subject. \"A\" war movies are about War, but \"B\" war movies are about soldiers.[6] | In November 21, 2004, Roger Ebert added The Big Red One to his list of \"great movies\".[6] | It is currently listed \"Certified Fresh\" by the critical website Rotten Romatoes, with a 91% rating and aggregate score of 7.7 based on 44 reviews. On the re-edited version of the film, Rotten Tomatoes' consensus states: \"The reconstruction of Samuel Fuller's epic account of his days in North Africa in World War II elevates the film into the pantheon of great war movies.\"[7]","m_production":"Warner Brothers Studio was interested in filming The Big Red One in the late 1950s, sending Fuller on a trip to Europe to scout locations. Fuller directed Merrill's Marauders as a dry run for the film. When Fuller argued with Jack L. Warner and his studio over cuts they made to Merrill's Marauders, the plans for the film The Big Red One were dropped.[1] | Originally, John Wayne was to play the sergeant, but Fuller felt that he was not right for the role.[1] | Peter Bogdanovich helped set up the film at Paramount Pictures, which paid Fuller to write a script. However, when Paramount head Frank Yablans left the studio, the project was in turnaround. It shifted over to Lorimar with Bogdanovich to produce (he says Fuller wanted him to play the Robert Carradine part) but then Bogdanovich pulled out and brought in Gene Corman to produce.[3] | The film was shot on location in Israel and Ireland, with some snow scenes featuring Marvin shot in and around Big Bear National Park. Trim Castle in Trim, County Meath was used as the derelict castle where the adolescent sniper kills one of the GIs (Boyne) as he crosses the river. | Originally rated PG by the MPAA, the film reconstruction by Brian Jamieson and Richard Schickel was re-rated R for \"war violence and some language\".[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Samuel Fuller","m_produced_by":"Gene Corman","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Lee Marvin Mark Hamill Robert Carradine Bobby Di Cicco Kelly Ward Siegfried Rauch Marthe Villalonga Stéphane Audran","m_music_by":"Dana Kaproff","m_cinematography":"Adam Greenberg","m_edited_by":"Morton Tubor","m_production_company":"Lorimar","m_distributed_by":"United Artists (original release) Warner Bros.
