{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Supernova chronicles the search and rescue patrol of a medical ship in deep space in the early 22nd century and its six-member crew, which includes captain and pilot A.J. Marley (Robert Forster), co-pilot Nick Vanzant (James Spader), medical officer Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), medical technician Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips), search and rescue paramedic Danika Lund (Robin Tunney) and computer technician Benjamin Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz). Aboard their vessel, the Nightingale 229, they receive an emergency distress signal coming from an ice mining operation on the moon Titan 37, more than 3,000 light years away. | The crew answers the call and dimension jumps — during which Captain Marley suffers fatal injuries due to a malfunction of the ship's equipment — arriving in the path of Titan 37's debris cloud, some of which damages the ship and causes the loss of 82 percent of its maneuvering fuel. Worse still, Titan 37 orbits a blue giant, and its high gravity field will pull the ship to the point where it will be incinerated in 17 hours, 12 minutes — which happens to be almost the same amount of time that the Nightingale 229 will need to recharge its jump drive, their only possible hope for escape. With only an 11-minute window for escape, the surviving crew soon find themselves in danger from the disturbing young man (Peter Facinelli) they rescue, and the mysterious alien artifact he has smuggled aboard. This artifact is analyzed by the ship's computer and is said to contain nine-dimensional matter. | It is ultimately discovered that the young man who called for rescue is actually Karl Larson, an old former lover of Kaela (it is implied they had an abusive relationship). Karl came into contact with the nine-dimensional matter after recovering the artifact. It somehow enabled him to acquire super strength and supernatural healing abilities, and made him younger (such that Kaela did not recognize him). Karl murders most of the crew except Kaela and strands Nick on the mining platform. Karl unsuccessfully attempts to romantically reconcile with Kaela. Nick finds his way back to the medical ship through a rescue pod left on the mining platform, and a battle ensues between Nick and Karl. Karl is ultimately killed by Kaela using explosives placed near the alien artifact which Karl was obsessed with retrieving. The explosion ejects the artifact into space, hurtling it towards the blue giant. | With moments left before the dimension jump activates, Kaela and Nick place themselves into the only remaining dimensional stabilization chamber (Karl had destroyed all but one), which is the only thing that enables human beings to survive the ship's dimensional jump drive. The pods are meant to hold only one person, however — two subjects might be genetically mixed during the dimensional jump. Before Nick and Kaela enter the only remaining pod, the computer warns them that the nine-dimensional matter is reacting with the gravity of the blue giant sun and will cause a nine-dimensional reaction that will spread in all directions, such that the reaction's resulting supernova will reach Earth within 51 years. The computer hypothesizes that the reaction will either destroy life on Earth or \"enable humankind to achieve a new level of existence.\" Just before the blue giant supernovas, the ship engages in a dimensional jump which brings Nick and Kaela back to Earth. As a result of their being in the same pod, the two of them each have one eye of the other person's original eye color. The ship's computer also reveals that Kaela is pregnant, which may be the result of them being in the pod together during the jump, or the result of their copulation hours earlier.","m_cast":"James Spader as Nick Vanzant | Angela Bassett as Dr. Kaela Evers | Robert Forster as A.J.

Malone envisioned it as a modestly budgeted film which would cost around $5–6 million and be like \"Dead Calm in space\".[1] | The original script was about a space expedition that discovers artifacts from an alien civilization and brings them back to Earth; one of the artifacts unleashes an evil force. Malone and producer Ash R Shah asked H.R. Giger to produce some conceptual sketches to help promote the script.[1] | MGM bought the project and a series of writers were put on the script, including David Campbell Wilson, Daniel Chuba, Cathy Rabin and Thomas Wheeler. By 1997 the story had changed to be about a deep space medical ship called the Nova which answers a distress signal and finds an aging cargo vessel about to be sucked into a black hole. The sole survivor of the sinking ship comes on board the Nova. | Australian Geoffrey Wright was originally attached to direct but left the project two months before principal photography was to begin due to \"creative differences.\" Apparently, he had an idea about shooting the entire movie in zero gravity, but MGM disagreed. Vincent D'Onofrio was originally cast as the computer tech but when Wright was fired, D'Onofrio also walked out.[4] Wright was replaced by Jack Sholder, but then the studio replaced him with Walter Hill. Hill says he \"was interested in doing a science fiction thing\"; he thought the script \"had fixable problems\" and he wanted to work with James Spader.[5] | Hill says problems began when he did a rewrite of the script, not knowing that the president of United Artists (Lindsay Doran)[6] was very attached to the script. He says the budget of the film was cut halfway through production.[5] | Shooting began in April 1998. After principal photography was finished in July 1998, Walter Hill spend a total of 24 weeks editing his director's cut of the movie which still didn't have all the special effects scenes added into it. MGM decided to screen the movie to a test audience. Hill told them that the screening would be a complete disaster because the movie was still not finished, and because he wanted to shoot some more footage. MGM refused the number of effects shots requested by Hill, and cut out half of them, including a complex sequence in which James Spader's character Nick Vanzant performs a nail-biting zero-gravity rescue inside a giant bubble of water, and a remotely operated medical robot was replaced by a humanoid android.[1] MGM screened the movie and, just like Hill said, the test screening audience hated it. Hill would later remark: | We limped in, in post we had a tremendous amount of effect stuff to do. They decided they wanted to preview the movie without the effects. I said this was insane, it's a science fiction movie. The effects had to be added. They wanted to see how it played. I told them it would be like shit, terrible, very bad preview, you will give up on the movie. These previews under these conditions are political. \"Are you saying you won't preview the movie?\" I said \"You own the God damn thing. If you want to preview it, I can't prevent you, but I won't go.\" They saw this as defiance.[5] | Taking this into consideration and after more arguments with MGM, Hill quit the project. After test screenings went badly MGM hired another director, Jack Sholder, to re-edit Hill's footage and do some re-shoots to try and save the movie. Sholder deleted a lot of the scenes from Hill's version, including many scenes of character development, added the scene where James Spader's character is piloting the ship to safety after they jump into the supernova high-gravity field (originally auto-pilot saved the ship from crash but Sholder wanted to give Spader's character something more to do), added some scenes with more focus on humor, changed the original voice of the ship's computer Sweetie and added a new one which had \"more emotion\", removed entire dialogue from another computer called George who was on Titan and who gave Nick some information about the mining colony, removed the original rock/electronic-like score by Burkhard Dallwitz, and added a new one by David C. Williams. After Sholder's cut was test screened and got a better reaction from a test audience, new people got involved in United Artists studio (who with MGM was producing the movie) and they weren't happy with the reaction that Supernova got from the test screening of Sholder's cut. The studio went back to Hill, who proposed $5 million of reshoots and wanted more time for filming. When he was refused, Hill quit the project for good and MGM then shelved the movie.[7] | In August of 1999, MGM board member Francis Ford Coppola was brought in by MGM to supervise another re-editing of the movie costing $1 million at his American Zoetrope facility in Northern California. But even Coppola's re-edited version had negative test screening and didn't get the PG-13 rating by MPAA that the studio wanted. Creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, whose special effects were mostly cut out from the movie, said that Walter Hill wanted the movie to be much more grotesque, strange and disturbing while MGM wanted to make it more of a hip, sexy movie in space and they didn't want a full-blown makeup effects film. By October of 1999, MGM decided to sell the movie.[8] | The movie was eventually released on January 17, 2000, almost two years later than planned.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Walter Hill","m_produced_by":"Ash R.
