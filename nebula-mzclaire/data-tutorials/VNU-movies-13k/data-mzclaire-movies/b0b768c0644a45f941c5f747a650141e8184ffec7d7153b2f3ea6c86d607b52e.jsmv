{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"An NSA mission to collect information on Anarchy 99, a mercenary group of former Russian soldiers goes awry when the agent's identity is discovered. Anarchy 99 has a biochemical weapon named \"Silent Night,\" missing since the fall of the Soviet Union, and NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons believes the only way to get close is to recruit an agent that would not have any ties to the United States government. He selects Xander Cage, also known as X, an extreme sports professional and host of his own television show, who was recently captured by the FBI for stealing and destroying a prominent California senator's car as an act of protest. Gibbons puts Cage through two tests – stopping a staged diner robbery and escaping from a drug cartel's plantation in Colombia – and offers Cage the mission. Cage reluctantly agrees when Gibbons offers to wipe his criminal record. | Cage goes to Prague and meets with the NSA support team including Czech agent Milan Sova. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage purposely reveals Sova's cover, which allows him to gain the confidence of Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi. Through Yorgi's brother Kolya, who is a fan of Cage's show, Cage gains critical information on the military background of Anarchy 99's members. Cage is attending a car deal with Yorgi at his invitation when Sova shows up and starts a firefight. Cage shoots Sova with a fake blood-splatter round to make it look like he is dead, which causes Yorgi to fully accept Cage as a member of Anarchy 99. Cage returns with Yorgi to their headquarters, a castle outside of the city, where he meets Yorgi's girlfriend Yelena. Cage finds Yelena trying to break into Yorgi's safe and tells her he is an American agent. Yelena gets a call from Kirill, a sniper working for Yorgi, who reveals they know of Cage's true identity before he starts firing on them. Cage helps Yelena to escape, but is kidnapped by the NSA team. Agent Gibbons tells Cage to return home since his cover is blown, but Cage refuses as he fears for Yelena's safety from both Yorgi and a planned attack on the castle by special forces. Cage learns that Sova purposely blew his cover. | Cage sneaks back to the castle and overhears Yorgi's plans to equip a waterborn drone named Ahab with \"Silent Night\" to release the biochemical in the middle of every major city, starting with Prague. Yorgi tests the weapon on his scientists, killing them. Cage rescues her from Yorgi and kills Kolya. At a safehouse, Yelena explains she is an FSB agent, working undercover to get close to Yorgi two years ago, but six months after the start of the operation, her contacts abandoned her. Cage races to a nearby monitoring station which Anarchy 99 uses to secure the castle and destroys it by starting an avalanche, but is captured by Yorgi's forces. | Cage is taken back to Yorgi, who reveals he has captured Yelena again and has known about her true identity. As the special forces attack starts, Cage and Yelena use the opportunity to escape, killing Kirill and Yorgi, who already launched Ahab towards the center of Prague. Cage alerts Gibbons, who has the Czech military prepare to destroy the Ahab via airstrikes with the unfortunate side effect of releasing some of the biochemical agent. Cage harpoons Ahab from the car and causes the drone to sink underwater. Cage is rescued and Gibbons promises Yelena American citizenship. Cage and Yelena are relaxing in Bora Bora when Gibbons calls, telling him there is another mission. Cage ignores him and swims with Yelena.","m_cast":"Vin Diesel as Xander Cage/xXx | Asia Argento as Yelena | Samuel L.

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 48% of the critics gave the film positive reviews based on a sample of 178 reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10.[3] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed the film, giving it 3 and a half stars out of 4. It was a financial success with total gross $277,448,382.[2] | This film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie, but lost to Jackass: The Movie.","m_production":"In August 2001, Sony put a large billboard of \"xXx\" in Hollywood, before a script had been written.[4] There was also a teaser trailer released on May 3, 2002. It was then attached to Spider-Man, and shown on the web. | Filming took place at three locations. Most of the film is set in Prague, Czech Republic. The Corvette jump was filmed at the Foresthill Bridge in Auburn State Recreation Area, Auburn, California. The final scenes were set in Bora Bora, Tahiti, and other areas in Southern West Virginia. | Several Czech Su-22s were used for the film. It was one of the last \"actions\" of these aircraft - Czech Air Force decommissioned Sukhois in 2002. | Stunt player Harry O'Connor, Diesel's stunt double, was killed when he hit a pillar of the Palacky Bridge in Prague, para-sailing during one of the action scenes. The accident occurred while filming the second take of the stunt; O'Connor's first attempt was completed without incident and can be seen in the completed film.[5] | The first few minutes of the film take place at a Rammstein concert in Prague. The same clip is available, but from the band's perspective (with only brief scenes from the film) in their video compilation Lichtspielhaus.[6]","m_sequel":"The film was followed by a sequel in 2005, entitled State of the Union, starring the rapper Ice Cube and directed by Lee Tamahori. Neither Diesel, Cohen, nor xXx creator Rich Wilkes were involved in the sequel, and there were notable differences in both style (less emphasis on extreme sports) and music (rock music was replaced with hip hop and rap). xXx: State of the Union was poorly received by critics. It currently has a rating of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes.[7] The sequel was also a financial failure, making less than expected when compared to the original film.[8] In January 2014, Vin Diesel confirmed work on a sequel tentatively titled xXx: The Return of Xander Cage. On August 23, 2015, Vin Diesel announced on his Instagram page that \"While I was filming XXX, guys on set called me Air Diesel... The time to return has come. Filming starts December in the Philippines. #ILiveForThisShit...\".[9] On October 10, 2015, it was reported that director D. J. Caruso will direct xXx: The Return of Xander Cage.[10] Diesel announced on his Instagram account that UFC fighter Conor McGregor was cast in a role and Facebook that Jackson will be reprising his role as Gibbons.[11][12] In January 2016, Twitch reports that Tony Jaa, Jet Li and Deepika Padukone are cast in roles, Nina Dobrev and Ruby Rose were cast in roles with Dobrev as a witty and sarcastic techie, Padukone as a huntress who happens to be Cage’s former lover and Rose will play a sniper and Li was confirmed in the film as the leader of his own team and will square off against Cage, it's whether he is the ultimate villain of the pic remains to be seen. Andrey Ivchenko was confirmed to be another villain in the film as one of the big bads Diesel is set to lock horns with, given that earlier reports revealed Li also joined the threequel as a potential adversary. [13][14][15][16] On February 12, 2016, reports brought in the news that Jet Li dropped out of the film and was replaced with Donnie Yen in the role of the main antagonist.[17] | Xxx ]]","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Rob Cohen","m_produced_by":"Neal H.
