{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Mattie Ross, the narrator and protagonist, explains that her father was murdered by Tom Chaney when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with Ned \"Lucky\" Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. | Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn to search for Chaney, but Cogburn leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. | After being refused passage on the river ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually stops him and allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. While pursuing the Pepper gang, the two meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincey and Moon, and interrogate them. Quincey initially insists that they have no information about the Pepper gang, but eventually Moon divulges what he knows to Cogburn; Quincey fatally stabs Moon, and Cogburn shoots Quincey dead. Before dying, Moon says Pepper and his gang will be returning that night. | LaBoeuf arrives at the dugout and is confronted by the Pepper gang. Cogburn, hiding on the hillside with Mattie, shoots two gang members and accidentally hits LaBoeuf, but Pepper escapes. The next day, Cogburn gets in a drunken argument with the wounded LaBoeuf, who departs again. While retrieving water from a stream, Mattie encounters Chaney. She shoots and wounds him, but he survives and drags her back to Ned, who forces Cogburn to leave by threatening to kill her. Ned leaves Mattie alone with Chaney, ordering him not to harm her or he will not get paid after his remount arrives. | Chaney tries to knife Mattie, but LaBoeuf appears and knocks Chaney out, explaining that he and Cogburn devised a plan. They watch from a cliff as Cogburn takes on the remaining members of Ned's gang, killing two and wounding Ned, before his horse is shot and falls, trapping Cogburn's leg. LaBoeuf, snipes Pepper from roughly four hundred yards away. Chaney regains consciousness and surprises LaBoeuf, knocking him unconscious with a rock. Mattie seizes LaBoeuf's rifle and shoots Chaney in the chest. The recoil knocks her into a deep pit. In an attempt to escape the pit, Mattie awakens a rattlesnake. Cogburn soon arrives, but Mattie is bitten by the rattlesnake before he can get to her. Cogburn cuts into her hand to suck out as much of the venom as he can, and then rides day and night to get Mattie to a doctor, carrying her on foot after her horse collapses from exhaustion, finally making his way to Bagby's store. | Twenty-five years later, in 1903, Mattie reveals through narration that her left forearm was amputated due to gangrene from the snakebite. Cogburn stayed with her until she was out of danger, but left the store before she regained consciousness. She never saw Cogburn again, despite a letter she wrote to him inviting him to visit and to collect the money she still owed him. She receives a note from Cogburn inviting her to meet him at a travelling Wild West show where he now performs. She arrives, only to learn that Cogburn died three days earlier. She has his body moved to her family cemetery. Standing over Cogburn's grave, she reflects on her decision to move his remains, and about never having married. She also reveals that she never saw LaBoeuf again.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"True Grit  by Charles Portis","m_directed_by":"Joel Coen Ethan Coen","m_produced_by":"Joel Coen Ethan Coen Scott Rudin","m_screenplay_by":"Joel Coen Ethan Coen","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Elizabeth Marvel","m_music_by":"Carter Burwell","m_cinematography":"Roger Deakins","m_edited_by":"Joel Coen Ethan Coen (as Roderick Jaynes)","m_production_company":"Skydance Productions Mike Zoss Productions Scott Rudin Productions","m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 22, 2010 (2010-12-22) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$38 million[1]","m_box_office":"$252.3 million[2] | True Grit is a 2010 American Revisionist Western film directed, written, produced and edited by the Coen brothers and executive produced by Steven Spielberg. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously filmed in 1969 starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell. This version stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Deputy U.S. Marshal Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn, along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper. After an outlaw named Tom Chaney murders her father, feisty 14-year-old farm girl Mattie Ross hires Cogburn, a boozy, trigger-happy lawman, to help her find Chaney (Brolin) and avenge her father. The bickering duo are accompanied on their quest by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Damon), who has been tracking Chaney for killing a State Senator. As they embark on a dangerous adventure, each character has their \"grit\" tested in unprecedented ways. | Filming began in March 2010, and the film was officially released in the U.
