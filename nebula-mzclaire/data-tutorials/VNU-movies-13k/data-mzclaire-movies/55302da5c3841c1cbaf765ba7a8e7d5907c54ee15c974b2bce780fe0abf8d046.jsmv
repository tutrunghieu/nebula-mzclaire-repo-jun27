{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the prologue, Hoffmann is in the audience at a performance by Stella, a prima ballerina. Stella sends Hoffmann a note asking him to meet her after the performance, but the note is intercepted by his rival, Councillor Lindorf. Not having received her note, Hoffmann goes to the tavern in the interval, where he tells the story of a clown, Kleinzach, and three stories of his past loves — Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia, and gets drunk. | In the first story, Olympia is an automaton created by scientist Spalanzani and magic spectacle maker Coppelius. Hoffmann falls for the doll, ignorant of her artifice and is mocked when he finally discovers she is 'automatic'. | In the second story, Hoffmann in Venice falls for Giulietta, a courtesan, but she seduces him to steal his reflection for the magician Dapertutto. | In the third story, Antonia is a soprano suffering from an incurable illness and must not sing, but the evil Dr Miracle makes her sing and she dies, breaking the hearts of Hoffmann and her father, Crespel. | Finally, in the epilogue, Hoffmann explains that all three women are all aspects of his love, Stella, who then appears in the tavern and, seeing Hoffmann drunk and incapable, is led away by Councillor Lindorf.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"In the later years of their partnership, Powell became interested in what he termed \"a composed film\", a marriage of image to operatic music. The finale of Black Narcissus and the ballet sequence of The Red Shoes were earlier steps toward his goal. | The Tales of Hoffmann is an achievement of this ideal, as the entire opera was pre-recorded to create the soundtrack, and the movie was edited to the rhythms of the music. The production is completely without dialogue and, with the exception of Robert Rounseville and Ann Ayars, none of the actors did their own singing. Some of the singers had established careers in Britain at the time. Grahame Clifford, for example, had been a leading comedian with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for several years, and Monica Sinclair was fast becoming an audience favourite at Covent Garden; she would later become one of the company's most popular artists of the next two decades. The acting (especially by Helpmann) is highly stylised and similar to that of the silent film era. | Each tale is marked by its own individual primary colour, denoting its theme. \"The Tale of Olympia\", set in Paris, has yellow contours highlighting the farcical nature and tone of the first act. \"The Tale of Giulietta\" is a hellish depiction of Venice, where dark colours, especially red, are used. The final tale, set in Greece, uses different shades of blue, alluding to its sad nature. The set design is deliberately made to look artificial with the costumes similarly stylised. The opening scene of the \"Tale of Giulietta\" (where Giulietta performs the \"Barcarolle\", the most famous theme of the opera) is staged on a gondola which moves through deliberately artificial Venetian canals, although it does not seem to actually move on the water. | The Tales of Hoffmann was in production from 1–16 July 1950[3] at Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, Surrey, in the UK[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Michael Powell Emeric Pressburger","m_produced_by":"Michael Powell Emeric Pressburger","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Moira Shearer Robert Helpmann Léonide Massine","m_music_by":"Jacques Offenbach","m_cinematography":"Christopher Challis","m_edited_by":"Reginald Mills","m_production_company":"London Films/The Archers","m_distributed_by":"British Lion Films (UK) Lopert Films (US)","m_release_dates":"4 April 1951 (US trade) 17 May 1951 (UK trade) 26 November 1951 (UK release) 13 June 1952 (US release) April 2015 (4K restoration)","m_running_time":"128 minutes 136 minutes (2015 re-release)","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"£105,035 (UK rentals)[1] $1.25 million (US rentals)[2] | The Tales of Hoffmann is a 1951 British Technicolor film adaptation of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, written, produced and directed by the team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger working under the umbrella of their production company, The Archers. | The opera film stars Robert Rounseville, Moira Shearer, Robert Helpmann and Léonide Massine, and features Pamela Brown, Ludmilla Tchérina and Ann Ayars.
