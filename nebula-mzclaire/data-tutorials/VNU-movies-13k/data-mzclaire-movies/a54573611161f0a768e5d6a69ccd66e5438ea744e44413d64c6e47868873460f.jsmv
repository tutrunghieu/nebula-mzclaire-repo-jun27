The script was commissioned on December 7, 1989 by Sawmill Entertainment and producer Richard L. Albert after he had seen Kaoma perform the song \"Lambada\" in Los Angeles. The script was written in about ten days, and filming began within a month. Albert's Sawmill Entertainment hired the same writers and director recently employed in making the suspense film Sight Unseen starring Susan Blakely. | The film was shot on 35mm film in and around Los Angeles, California, and was completed when a color-corrected answer print and other film elements were delivered to Columbia Pictures on March 15, 1990. Editing went on around the clock, with two separate crews of film editors working while the film was being shot. Two choreographers were hired, Miranda Garrison and Felix Chavez, and the work apportioned between them. Film critic Roger Ebert visited the set while filming, as news was publicized how fast a major-studio film could be produced. The film featured the 1989 song \"Lambada\", performed by the group Kaoma, which became involved in the Lambada dance craze. | It was released on March 16, 1990, the same day as rival film Lambada – whose producers brought an action before the MPAA title registry to block the use of the word \"Lambada\" in the title. Notwithstanding that attempt, posters went up in New York before the release promoting \"Lambada\" in large type followed by \"is the Forbidden Dance\" with a picture of Laura Harring and Jeff James dancing in the rain forest.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Greydon Clark","m_produced_by":"Richard L.
