{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bright lights descend from the night sky, tracing routes over four desert highways, eventually converging on an isolated crossroads. Lightning flashes and blue smoke are the result of their high-speed collision, revealing a sleek, all black Dodge M4S Turbo Interceptor, driven by a black-clad and helmeted figure. | Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes) is the leader of a gang of car thieves in Brooks, Arizona that coerce people with sporty cars into racing for pink slips, cheating them in order to win; he terrorizes and controls everyone through fear and intimidation, including his object of obsession Keri Johnson (Sherilyn Fenn), whom he views as his property. Keri's boyfriend James \"Jamie\" Hankins (Christopher Bradley) was mysteriously murdered, leaving no trace; Keri, who was with him, was hospitalized with no memory of the traumatic event. | Jacob \"Jake\" Kesey (Charlie Sheen) arrives in Brooks riding a Honda XL350R Enduro dirt bike. He stops and asks Keri Johnson for directions; for reasons Keri doesn't yet understand she is attracted to the stranger. Jake soon befriends both Keri and Jamie's brother William \"Billy\" Hankins (Matthew Barry), who works at Big Kay's, the local burger drive-in; they later meet up at a sun-and-swim gathering on a local river (while there, Jake is seen to have multiple scars on his neck and back). | Packard's control of the illegal races is suddenly over when the sleek, all black Turbo Interceptor and its phantom driver (referred to as \"The Wraith\") suddenly appear out of nowhere. The mysterious driver of this supercar is covered head-to-toe in futuristic black body armor and a black race helmet. The armor is adorned with bright metal braces resembling those worn by victims recovering from severe physical trauma. The car and driver challenges Packard's gang to race, explosively killing them one at a time in high-speed, fiery crashes, which leaves their bodies untouched except for burned-out eye sockets: First to race is Oggie Fisher (Griffin O'Neal) and later Minty (Chris Nash). Skank (David Sherrill) and Gutterboy (Jamie Bozian) are obliterated when the Wraith drives his supercar at high speed through the gang's isolated warehouse garage, causing a huge explosion. Sheriff Loomis (Randy Quaid) and his lawmen are always close behind and in hot pursuit during each deadly encounter, but the sleek Turbo Interceptor and its phantom driver vanish in an electric cloud of glowing light streaks right after the violent death of each gang member. | With Packard's gang having been destroyed by the Wraith, Rughead (Clint Howard), the gang's tech-geek, who alone among them did not participate in Jamie's murder, realizes that his gang was targeted because of that murder. Rughead then talks over all the recent strange events with Sheriff Loomis, the Sheriff learning from him that Packard murdered Jamie Hankins, Keri's boyfriend; Packard coveted Keri strictly for himself. Loomis realizes he cannot arrest Packard due to the disappearance of Jamie's body. | Keri becomes suspicious of who Jake actually is, and after she confronts him, he tells her to ask Packard, explaining that he knows why Jake is here; Jake also tells Keri he has come a long way for her and that \"my time is just about over\". | Packard, now the sole survivor of his gang, forces Keri at Big Kay's to leave town with him. When Billy attempts to intervene, Packard savagely beats him and then kidnaps Keri, telling her they are going to California. When she confronts him about murdering Jamie, he admits to the killing and stops his Corvette; he pulls out a switchblade just as the Turbo Interceptor pulls up. Packard then challenges its phantom driver to a final road race. Sheriff Loomis and his lawmen are again in hot pursuit, but the racers are soon far ahead; the supercar suddenly reverses direction, and Packard dies horribly in the fiery head-on collision and explosion that follows; his dead body is left intact, just like his dead gang members. With this destructive outcome, a frustrated Sheriff Loomis is forced to abandon his investigation. He observes \"You can't stop something that can't be stopped\", which leaves him with no rational answers for these violent events. | As Keri arrives home that night, the Turbo Interceptor pulls up, and the all black armored driver emerges, enveloped within flashing bolts of bright light; the figure transforms into Jake. Keri realizes that Jake is actually a returned version of her dead boyfriend Jamie, who then says \"this is as close I could come to who I once was\". He then asks her to wait for him because he has one last thing to do. | Jake drives the Turbo Interceptor to Big Kay's, startling his brother Billy. Jake hands over the keys to the supercar, noting '\"It's the only one in existence; it does very special things\". He then tells Billy that his work here is finished. Billy asks, \"Who are you, bro\"? To this, Jake wryly replies, \"You said it, Billy ... the instructions are in the glove compartment\". As Jake rides off on his dirt bike, Billy comes to the grief-stricken realization that Jake is somehow his returned older brother, Jamie. | Jake picks up Keri, who is now being watched from a distance by Sheriff Loomis, and together they ride off into the night, leaving the desert city and the past behind them forever.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin dismissed the film, as, \"... for those who favor fast cars and lots of noise.\"[5] In the Time Out review, editor John Pym saw The Wraith having \"comic-strip killer car thieves\" with \"... the best joke having one of the thugs knowing the word 'wraith'.\"[6] | At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a 27% positive rating based on only 11 reviews submitted. | Following its theatrical run, the film was featured on television in an episode of Cinema Insomnia.[7]","m_production":"The Wraith is dedicated to the memory of Bruce Ingram, a camera operator who died during the filming of one of the car chases; another crew member was seriously injured. According to supplementary material on the DVD; the camera car was overloaded and overturned while traveling at high speed.[1] | The Wraith was shot entirely in and around Tucson, Arizona; shots of the hilly road leading into the fictional \"Brooks, AZ\" were filmed on Freeman Road on the city's south side.

The film's swimming hole is located in Sabino Canyon, off North Upper Sabino Canyon Road. The curvy mountain road where Packard (Nick Cassavetes) and his gang challenge other cars to deadly races is the General Hitchcock/Catalina/Mount Lemmon Highway that winds through natural stone monoliths north of the city. Skank and Gutterboy chase after Jamie and Keri down North 4th Avenue at East 7th Street. The portion of the chase that leads into a tunnel is the since-redone tunnel on North 4th Avenue, where it crosses under railroad tracks; Jake and Keri are seen riding down the road through Sabino Canyon Recreation Area (near Sabino Lake Dam) northeast of Tucson. | The Dodge M4S Turbo Interceptor seen in the film was a pace car built by Chrysler Corporation and PPG Industries. Six copies were made for use in the film: two stunt cars made from molds of the original car and four non-drivable \"dummies\" that were destroyed during filming.
