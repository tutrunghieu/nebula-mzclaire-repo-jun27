{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In an unnamed European town, children go to a candy shop after school. Charlie Bucket, whose family is poor, can only stare through the window as the shop owner sings \"The Candy Man\". The newsagent for whom Charlie works after school gives him his weekly pay, which Charlie uses to buy a loaf of bread for his family. On his way home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem \"The Fairies\", and tells Charlie, \"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and his four bedridden grandparents. After he tells Grandpa Joe about the tinker, Joe tells him that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers, including his arch-rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies disguised as employees to steal his chocolate and candy recipes. Wonka disappeared, but three years later began selling more candy; the origin of Wonka's labor force is a mystery. | Wonka announces to the world that he has hidden five \"Golden Tickets\" in his chocolate Wonka Bars. The finders of these tickets will be given a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Four of the tickets are found by Augustus Gloop, a gluttonous German boy; Veruca Salt, a spoiled British girl; Violet Beauregarde, a gum-chewing American girl; and Mike Teevee, a television-obsessed American boy. As each winner is heralded to the world on TV, a sinister-looking man whispers to them. Then, the fifth ticket is found by a millionaire in Paraguay, South America, much to the dismay of Charlie and his family. | The next day, Charlie finds some money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Wonka Bar. After eating it, he uses the change that he has left to buy another one for his Grandpa Joe. At that time, the newspapers reveal that the Paraguayan millionaire had faked his ticket, and when Charlie opens the Wonka bar, he finds the real fifth golden ticket. Racing home, he is confronted by the sinister man seen whispering to the other winners. The man introduces himself as Slugworth and offers to pay him for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper. | Charlie returns home with his news. Grandpa Joe is so elated that he finds he can walk as Charlie chooses him as his chaperon. The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners at the factory gates. Each is required to sign an extensive contract before they may begin the tour. The factory is a psychedelic wonderland that includes a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms, lickable wallpaper, and other marvelous sweets and inventions. Wonka's workers are small men known as Oompa-Loompas. | During the tour, Augustus falls into the Chocolate River and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. Violet blows up as a blueberry after chewing an experimental three-course meal gum, against Wonka's warnings. The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and Grandpa Joe disregard Wonka's warning and sample the drinks on purpose, only to break the rules and get in trouble. They are not caught in the act, but have a near-fatal encounter with an exhaust fan. Veruca demands a goose that lays golden chocolate eggs, which leads her to singing \"I Want It Now\", and then falling down the garbage chute leading to the furnace. Her father shortly falls in trying to rescue her. Mike then succumbs to the lure of \"Wonkavision\", which teleports Mike but leaves him only six inches tall. All of this misbehavior has Oompa Loompas singing about their bad conduct. | In the Inventing Room, Wonka gives the remaining ticket winners an Everlasting Gobstopper on the condition that they never talk about or show them to anyone. At the end of the tour, only Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain, but Wonka dismisses them, without awarding them the promised lifetime supply of chocolate. Grandpa Joe follows Wonka to ask him about this, and Wonka angrily tells him that because they had violated the contract by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks, they receive nothing. Seeking revenge, Grandpa Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper, but Charlie can't bring himself to hurt Wonka intentionally and returns the candy back to him instead. | Wonka immediately changes his tone, and declares Charlie the winner. He reveals that \"Slugworth\" is actually an employee named Mr. Wilkinson, and the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test for all the kids: Charlie was the only one who passed. The trio enter the \"Wonkavator\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals to Charlie that his actual prize is the entire factory itself because Wonka had created the contest to find an honest child worthy enough to be his heir. He informs that Charlie and his family can move into the factory immediately.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Willy Wonka was released on 30 June 1971. The film was not a big success, being the fifty-third highest grossing film of the year in the U.S., earning just over $2.1 million on its opening weekend,[16] although it received positive reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert, who compared it to The Wizard of Oz.[17] | Seeing no significant financial advantage, Paramount decided against renewing its distribution deal for the film when it expired in 1977. Later that year, Warner Communications, the then-parent company of Warner Bros., acquired Wolper Pictures, Ltd., which led to Quaker Oats selling its share of the film's rights to Warner Bros. for $500,000 at the same time. | By the mid-1980s, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory had experienced a spike in popularity thanks in large part to repeated television broadcasts and home video sales. Following a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in 1996, it was released on DVD the next year, allowing it to reach a new generation of viewers. The film was released as a remastered special edition on DVD and VHS in 2001 to commemorate the film's 30th anniversary. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked it 25th in the \"Top 50 Cult Movies\" of all time. | Warner's ownership of the film helped them get the rights to make a new film adaptation that was released in 2005, as well as a stage musical adaptation that had its premiere in London in 2013. | The film currently holds an 89% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the critical consensus stating \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don't always work but express the film's uniqueness\".[18] | It has been argued that the film \"reflects an important shift in the family genre, deploying a mode of dual address that almost wilfully blurs the line between adult and child entertainment ... this [use of] dual address may be seen as a forerunner to a certain type of multivalent family film now synonymous with contemporary Hollywood animated features\".[19] | Willy Wonka was ranked No. 74 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments[20] for the \"scary tunnel\" scene. | American Film Institute Lists | AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs - Nominated[21] | AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs: \"The Candy Man\" - Nominated[22] | AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals - Nominated[23] | AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers - Nominated[24] | AFI's 10 Top 10 - Nominated Fantasy Film[25] | Dahl disowned the film, the script of which was partially rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines. Dahl said he was \"disappointed\" because \"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\", as well as the non-casting of Spike Milligan.[26] He was also \"infuriated\" by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay, including the conversion of Slugworth, a minor character in the book, into a spy (so that the movie could have a villain) and the \"fizzy lifting drinks\" scene.[26]","m_production":"The idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart's ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with \"Uncle Dave\" (producer David L. Wolper) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from their Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl√©). Wolper persuaded the company, who had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar.[4] | It was agreed that the film would be a children's musical, and that Dahl himself would write the screenplay.[4] However, the title was changed to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in order to promote the aforementioned candy tie-in. Screenwriter David Seltzer conceived a gimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary sources, such as Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a rival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to be revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the film).[4] | All six members of Monty Python: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, expressed interest in playing Wonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an international audience. Three of the members, Cleese, Idle and Palin, were later seriously considered for the same role in Tim Burton's version.[5][6] | Before Wilder was officially cast for the role, Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody and Jon Pertwee were all considered.[6][7] Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl's original choice to play Willy Wonka.[6] Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role.[8] | When Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition: | When I make my first entrance, I'd like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause. | The reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \"from that time on, no one will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\"[9] | Jean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee.[10][11] Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde.[12] Sammy Davis, Jr. wanted to play Bill, the candy store owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality.[5] Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the same reason.[12] | Principal photography commenced on 30 April 1970, and ended on 19 November 1970. The primary shooting location was Munich, Bavaria, West Germany, because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke M√ºnchen (Emmy-Noether-Stra√üe 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket's house, which was only a set constructed for the film, was filmed at Quellenstra√üe in Munich, Bavaria. Charlie's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Stra√üe 1 in Munich. Bill's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstra√üe, Munich. The closing sequence when the Wonkavator is flying above the factory is footage of N√∂rdlingen in Bavaria. | Munich Gasworks as it appears today (building on the left) | Munich Gasworks as it appears today (building on the left) | Munich Gasworks as it appears today | Munich Gasworks as it appears today | N√∂rdlingen, the town seen from above at the end of the film | N√∂rdlingen, the town seen from above at the end of the film | Production designer Harper Goff centered the factory on the massive Chocolate Room. According to Paris Themmen, who played Mike Teevee, \"The river was made of water with food coloring. At one point, they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it didn't really work. When asked this question, Michael B√∂llner, who played Augustus Gloop, answers, 'It vas dirty, stinking vater.'\"[13] | When interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition, Gene Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the crew had some problems with Paris Themmen, claiming that he was \"a handful\".[14] | Before its release, the film received advance publicity though TV commercials offering a \"Willy Wonka candy factory kit\" for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman, Life and any of the Cap'n Crunch brands.[15]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory¬† by Roald Dahl","m_directed_by":"Mel Stuart","m_produced_by":"Stan Margulies | David L.

It is an adaptation of the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl and tells the story of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum, in his only film appearance) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. | Filming took place in Munich in 1970, and the film was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received positive reviews and performed well in 1971, earning about $4 million at the end of its original run. It then made an additional $21 million during its re-release by Warner Bros. under the Family Entertainment banner in 1996. | The film has since developed a cult following, especially due to its repeated television airings and home entertainment sales. In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, and Wilder was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost both to Fiddler on the Roof. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". | Until 1977, Paramount distributed the film. From then on, all the rights to the film were handed over to Warner Bros. for home entertainment purposes starting in the 1980s. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) Release Info\".
