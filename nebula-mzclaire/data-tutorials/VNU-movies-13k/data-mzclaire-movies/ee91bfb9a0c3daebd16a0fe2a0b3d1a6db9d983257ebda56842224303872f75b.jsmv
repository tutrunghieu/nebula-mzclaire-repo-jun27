{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 17,000 B.C., the Seven Primes traveled the galaxy to create Energon with star-absorbing machines called Sun Harvesters. The Primes followed a rule in which to never destroy planets with life, but one of them, Megatronus Prime, later called The Fallen, deceives the others by building an army in secret and sets up a Sun Harvester on a planet with abundant life, Earth. After defeating ancient humans, The Fallen is confronted by the other Primes who defeat and imprison The Fallen before he can harvest Earth's sun with the Matrix of Leadership, and shortly afterwards sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix. | Two years after Megatron's demise, the Autobots join the U.S. military to form the Non-Biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST), a classified task force hunting down surviving Decepticons, led by William Lennox and Rob Epps. During a mission in Shanghai against the Decepticons Sideways and Demolisher, Optimus Prime learns of The Fallen's return from Demolisher's dying words: \"The Fallen will rise again\", but is unfamiliar with the name. National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway scolds the task force for their destructive tactics, reminding them that Megatron's corpse is still in the Laurentian Abyss and the last known AllSpark shard is locked up in NEST's headquarters. The Decepticon Communications Officer Soundwave hacks into a U.S. military satellite, eavesdropping for information and sends Ravage to retrieve the shard. | Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky prepares to attend college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Banes and guardian Bumblebee behind. While preparing for college, he gets a call from Mikaela. While on the phone, he removes an old jacket from his cupboard; a smaller AllSpark shard falls from within it. He picks up the shard, accidentally channeling its knowledge into his mind, causing him to see Cybertronian symbols and bringing the kitchen appliances to life. After Bumblebee destroys them, Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures the Decepticon Wheelie when he tries to steal it. The Constructicons resurrect Megatron by using the shard retrieved by Ravage and killing one of their own allies to provide parts for him. Megatron then flies to a moon of Saturn and reunites with his master, The Fallen. The Fallen orders Megatron to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, who is the last of the Primes and the only Transformer who can defeat him. | Sam, Mikaela, and Leo, Sam's college roommate, are targeted by the Decepticons. Alice, a Pretender Decepticon, first attempts to seduce Sam and then tries to attack him, but Mikaela and Leo enter the room and help him escape. They kill Alice, but are captured by Grindor under the orders of Megatron, who says that the symbols in Sam's mind will lead the Deceptions to a new Energon source. Megatron orders Scalpel to remove Sam's brain, but Optimus and Bumblebee arrive to rescue them. Bumblebee, Leo, and Mikaela escape as Optimus engages Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor in a vicious fight in the forest. Sam watches the three Decepticons overpower Optimus, but Optimus eventually gets the better of Megatron and Starscream; also killing Grindor. As Optimus attempts to find Sam, Megatron mortally stabs him. After encouraging Sam to run, Optimus dies. This forces the humans to retreat as Autobots repel Megatron and Starscream. | The Decepticons prepare for The Fallen's arrival by launching an assault on many areas around the world simultaneously; after landing on Earth, The Fallen, now informed of the death of Optimus, hijacks Earth's telecommunications systems, asking for Sam. In return, the assurance of mankind's survival. Sam, now an international fugitive, enlists the help of Seymour Simmons, who reveals that the Transformers visited Earth eons ago and the most ancient, known as Seekers, live in secret. With the help from Wheelie, they track down an elderly Decepticon turned Autobot named Jetfire, helping the group get to Egypt to find the Matrix of Leadership, which will revive Optimus. Simmons contacts NEST, telling them to bring Optimus and the other Autobots to Egypt. | Sam's group finds the Tomb of the Primes hidden in Petra, but the Matrix disintegrates into dust in Sam's hands. Undeterred, Sam places the Matrix's remains in his sock. Megatron orders the Decepticons to assault the area around the pyramid, leading to a full scale Decepticon attack. NEST and the Autobots land, but they are attacked by a large force of Decepticons. During the battle, Sam reunites with his parents (having found out about the Transformers existence) before getting rescued by Bumblebee, who ends up killing Ravage and Rampage in the process. During the battle, Devastator demolishes one of the Pyramids of Giza, revealing the Sun Harvester inside, before being killed by a strike called in by Simmons. With the Decepticons gaining the upper hand, Lennox and Epps call in an airstrike, which kills a large portion of the Decepticon ground forces. However, Megatron manages to shoot Sam in the confusion, seemingly killing him, before being forced to retreat to the Sun Harvester. Nearing his death, the Seven Primes contact Sam through a vision, telling him the Matrix is earned, and that he earned the right to bear it. They restore Sam's life and the Matrix, which the latter is used to revive Optimus. | The Fallen, sensing the Matrix's restoration and the resurrection of Optimus, teleports to their location and steals the Matrix from Optimus, then returns to the pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. The military assaults the pyramid but are no match to the telekinetic powers of The Fallen, who all but destroys the attack force. A wounded Jetfire sacrifices himself in order for Optimus to gain his parts which gives him immense strength and the ability to fly. Optimus takes to flight and knocks The Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid, destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. The Fallen and Optimus fight ferociously until Megatron appears and attacks Optimus from behind. Optimus uses his new strength to severely injure Megatron, knocking him through a wall and disabling him. Optimus re-engages The Fallen who begins to tear Optimus' new armour apart, but Optimus gains the upper hand by disarming The Fallen and using his own spear against him, impaling him through the shoulder. Wounded, The Fallen attempts to escape, but Optimus rips his face off and crushes his spark out of his chest, finally killing him, while an injured Megatron watches in horror. Vowing vengeance, he retreats with Starscream. Victorious at last, the Autobots and their allies return to the United States as Optimus ends the movie with a victory speech. | In a mid-credit scene Sam, and Mikaela continue their relationship by kissing on a motor-cycle, In a second credit scene Sam returns to collage, were the professor says \"Thank you for joining us Mr. Einstein\"","m_cast":"Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a recent high school graduate who is unwittingly drawn again into the Autobot cause to unravel an ancient mystery implanted into his mind by the now-destroyed AllSpark. | Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes, Sam's juvenile car thief girlfriend. | Josh Duhamel as Maj.

Prior to a potential Directors Guild of America strike, Bay began creating animatics of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film. This would allow animators to complete sequences if the Directors Guild of America went on strike in July 2008, which ultimately did not happen.[4][5] Bay considered making a small project in between Transformers and its sequel, but decided against the idea, saying \"you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it\".[6] | Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who had written the first film, originally passed on the opportunity to write a sequel due to schedule conflicts. The studio began courting other writers in May 2007, but were unimpressed with other pitches and eventually convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return.[4] The studio also hired Ehren Kruger, who had impressed Bay and Hasbro president Brian Goldner with his knowledge of the Transformers mythology.[7] The writing trio were paid $8 million.[4] Screenwriting was interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, but to avoid production delays, the writers spent two weeks writing a treatment, which they handed in the night before the strike began.[8] Bay then expanded the outline into a 60-page scriptment,[9] which included more action, humor, and characters.[8][10] The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while \"locked\" in two hotel rooms by Bay; Kruger wrote in his own room and the trio would check on each other's work twice a day.[11] | Orci described the film's theme as \"being away from home\", with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college.[12] He wanted the focus between the robots and humans \"much more evenly balanced\",[13] \"the stakes [to] be higher\", and more focused on the science fiction elements.[14] Orci added he wanted to \"modulate\" the humor more,[15] and felt he managed the more \"outrageous\" jokes by balancing them with a more serious plot approach to the Transformers' mythology.[16] Bay concurred that he wanted to please fans by making the tone darker,[17] and that \"mums will think it[']s safe enough to bring the kids back out to the movies.\"[18] Two elements were added late into the film: the Autobot Jolt—as General Motors wanted to advertise the Chevrolet Volt—and the railgun that kills Devastator, a new acquisition by the U.S. Military.[19] | In September 2007, Paramount announced a late June 2009 release date for the sequel to Transformers.[20] The film was given a $200 million budget, which was $50 million more than the first film,[21] and some of the action scenes rejected for the original were written into the sequel.[22] Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura later stated the studio proposed filming two sequels simultaneously, but he and Bay agreed that the idea was not the right direction for the series.[23] | Prior to the first film's release, producer Tom DeSanto had \"a very cool idea\" to introduce the Dinobots,[24] while Bay was interested in including an aircraft carrier, which was dropped from the 2007 film.[25] Orci claimed they did not incorporate these characters into Revenge of the Fallen because they could not think of a way to justify the Dinobots' choice of form,[12] and were unable to fit in the aircraft carrier.[26] Orci also admitted he was dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs, saying \"I recognize I am weird in that department.\"[27] However, he became fonder of them during filming because of their popularity with fans.[28] He added \"I couldn't see why a Transformer would feel the need to disguise himself in front of a bunch of lizards. Movie-wise, I mean. Once the general audience is fully on board with the whole thing, maybe Dinobots in the future.\"[29] When asked on the subject, Michael Bay said he hated the Dinobots and they had never been in consideration for being featured in the movies.[30] | During production, Bay attempted to create a misinformation campaign to increase debate over what Transformers would be appearing in the film, as well as to try to throw fans off from the story of the film; however, Orci confessed it was generally unsuccessful.[26] The studio went as far as to censor MTV and Comic Book Resources interviews with Mowry and Furman, who confirmed Arcee and The Fallen would be in the picture.[31] Bay told Empire that Megatron would not be resurrected, claiming his new tank form was a toy-only character,[21] only for Orci to confirm Megatron would return in the film in February 2009.[32] Bay also claimed he faked the leaking of daily call sheets from the first week of filming, that revealed Ramón Rodríguez's casting,[33] and the appearance of Jetfire and the twins.[34] | Inspired by its use in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, three action sequences in Revenge of the Fallen were shot using IMAX cameras.[17] Although screenwriter Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D,[35] Bay later said he found 3D too \"gimmicky\". Bay added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras.[36] | The majority of interior scenes for the film were shot in the former Hughes Aircraft soundstages at Playa Vista.[37] From June 2–4, the production filmed an action sequence at the Bethlehem Steel site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which was used to represent a portion of Shanghai.[9][38] Afterwards, they shot at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.[39] The crew moved to Philadelphia on June 9, where they shot at a defunct PECO Richmond power station, the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Eastern State Penitentiary, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia City Hall, Rittenhouse Square, historic Chancellor Street (which represents a street near Place de la Concorde in Paris), and Wanamaker's.[40][41][42][43] The production moved to Princeton University on June 22.[44] Filming there angered some students at the University of Pennsylvania, believing Bay had chosen to reshoot scenes at Princeton and script Princeton's name in the film. However, neither the University of Pennsylvania nor Princeton gave Bay permission to be named in the film because of a scene that both institutions felt \"did not represent the school\" in which Sam's mother ingests marijuana-laced brownies.[45] | Bay scheduled a break for filming beginning on June 30, turning his attention to animation and second unit scenes because of the potential guild strike.[46] Shooting for the Shanghai battle later continued in Long Beach, California.[47] In September, the crew shot at Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The two locations were used for Qatar in Transformers and stood in for Egypt in this film.[48] A scale model in Los Angeles was also used for some close-ups of the pyramids.[21] Shooting at Tucson International Airport and the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group's aircraft boneyard took place in October under the fake working title Prime Directive (a reference to Star Trek).[49] Filming also took place at Camp Pendleton and Davis–Monthan Air Force Base.[37] | The first unit then shot for three days in Egypt at the Giza pyramid complex and Luxor. The shoot was highly secretive, but according to producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a crew of 150 Americans and \"several dozen local Egyptians\" ensured a \"remarkably smooth\" shoot.[50] Bay earned the Egyptian government's approval to film at the pyramids by contacting Zahi Hawass, whom Bay said \"put his arm around me and said, 'Don't hurt my pyramids.'\"[37] A 50-foot-tall (15 m) camera crane was used at the location.[21] Bay stated he found the climax of the first film to be weak, partly because it was shot across five different city blocks, making the action confusing and hard to follow. On this film, the final battle in Egypt was devised to make it easier to follow the action.[51] | Four days were then spent in Jordan; the Royal Jordanian Air Force aided in filming at Petra, Wadi Rum and Salt because King Abdullah II is a big fan of science fiction movies.[52][53] Filming continued at the Place de la Concorde in Paris with second unit shots of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.[54] The cast and crew finished principal photography on the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis on November 2, 2008.[55] | Hasbro became more involved in the designs of the robots than the company was for Transformers.[15] The company, along with Takara Tomy, suggested to the filmmakers that combining robots be the main draw for the sequel.[56] They insisted on keeping the alternate modes of some of the returning characters similar so that consumers would not have to buy toys of the same characters.[57] Bay used real F-16 Fighting Falcon and tank fire when filming the battles.[23] Many of the new Autobot cars supplied by General Motors were brightly colored to look distinctive on screen.[58] Revenge of the Fallen features 46 robots, while the original movie had 14.[59] | Scott Farrar returned as visual effects supervisor and anticipated moodier use of lighting as well as deeper roles for the Decepticons.[clarification needed] He stated that with the bigger deadline, post-production would become a \"circus\".[60] The producers expected that with a bigger budget and the special effects worked out, the Transformers would have a larger role. Peter Cullen recalled, \"Don Murphy mentioned to me, 'Only because of the tremendous expense to animate Optimus Prime, he'll be in just a certain amount of [Transformers].' But he said, 'Next time, if the movie is a success, you're gonna be in it a ton.'\"[61] Michael Bay hoped to include more close-ups of the robots' faces.[62] The heads had to be designed with more pieces in order to express emotions in a more convincing way.[59] Farrar said the animators implemented more \"splashes and the hits and the fighting on dirt or moving, banging into trees, [...] things splinter and break, [the robots] spit, they outgas, they sweat, they snort.\" Shooting in the higher resolution of IMAX required up to 72 hours to render a single frame of animation.[63][64] While ILM used 15 terabytes for Transformers, they used 140 for the sequel.[53] Particularly problematic effects were the lighting, with scenes such as Jetfire inside the Smithsonian requiring 41 light sources, and the destruction of the pyramid, which appears in about five shots and required seven months to simulate the behavior of the blocks.[59] Orci hinted the majority of the Decepticons were entirely computer-generated in both robot and alternate modes, making it easier to write additional scenes for them in post-production.[65] Rendering the Devastator took over 85% of ILM's render farm capacity, and the complexity of the scene and having to render it at IMAX resolution caused one computer to \"explode\".[66] | The score to Revenge of the Fallen was composed by Steve Jablonsky, who reunited with director Michael Bay to record his score with a 71-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.[67] Jablonsky and his score producer Hans Zimmer composed various interpretations of a song by Linkin Park called \"New Divide\" for the score.[68]","m_sequel":"Main article: Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Transformers: Age of Extinction, and Transformers: The Last Knight | The third film, Dark of the Moon was released June 29, 2011.

It is a sequel to Transformers (2007) and the second installment in the live-action Transformers series taking place two years after the first. The plot revolves around Sam Witwicky, who is caught in the war between two factions of alien robots, the Autobots, lead by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons, lead by Megatron. Sam is having strange visions of Cybertronian symbols, and being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen, who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the sun and all life on Earth in the process. This is the first film to feature the largest cast and Transformers, including the Constructicons for the first time in the series. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Megatron, Starscream, Bonecrusher and Scorponok. | With deadlines jeopardized by possible strikes by the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild, Bay managed to finish the production on time with the help of previsualization and a scriptment by his writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and series newcomer Ehren Kruger. Shooting took place from May to November 2008, with locations in Egypt, Jordan, Bethlehem Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, as well as air bases in New Mexico and Arizona. | Revenge of the Fallen was released on June 19, 2009 in the United Kingdom and on June 24, 2009 in the United States. The film grossed a total of $402.1 million in North America and $434.2 million in other territories, for a total of $836.3 million worldwide. It was the second highest grossing film of 2009 in North America, 22nd domestically, the 84th highest-grossing film of all time and fourth highest of the year worldwide. With over 11 million home media sales in 2009, it was also the top-selling film of the year in the United States. | Metacritic said the film received \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[3] The film won three Golden Raspberry Awards at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony and became the highest-grossing film to win the Worst Picture award, with many critics considering it one of the worst films of all time. This was the last film in the series to star Megan Fox, and was also the last film in the series to be distributed by DreamWorks Pictures, leaving Paramount Pictures to become the distributor of its future films. | A third film, Dark of the Moon, was released on June 29, 2011 and a fourth film, Age of Extinction, was released on June 27, 2014. A fifth film, Transformers: The Last Knight is scheduled for a 2017 release. A sixth film serving as a Bumblebee spin-off is scheduled for a 2018 release. A seventh film, serving as the sixth main entry Transformers 6 is scheduled for a 2019 release. |  | ","m_marketing":"An additional $150 million was spent to market the film globally.[69] Hasbro's Revenge of the Fallen toy line included new molds of new and returning characters, as well as 2007 figures with new mold elements or new paint schemes.[70] The first wave was released on May 30, although Bumblebee and Soundwave debuted beforehand.[71] The second wave came in August 2009, which introduced toys such as 2¼-inch human action figures that fit inside the transforming robots, and non-transforming replicas of the cars that can be used on a race track. Product placement partners on the film include Burger King, 7-Eleven, LG phones, Kmart, Wal-Mart, YouTube, Nike, Inc. and M&M's, as well as Jollibee in the Philippines.[72] General Motors' financial troubles limited its involvement in promotion of the sequel, although Paramount acknowledged with or without GM, their marketing campaign was still very large and had the foundation of the 2007 film's success.[73][74][75] Kyle Busch drove a Revenge of the Fallen decorated car at Infineon Raceway on June 21, 2009,[76] while Josh Duhamel drove a 2010 Camaro at the Indianapolis 500.[77] At the movie's launch in China, a version of Bumblebee was constructed using a Volkswagen Jetta.[78] | Chris Mowry and artist Alex Milne, who had collaborated on The Reign of Starscream comic book, reunited for IDW Publishing's prequel to the film. Originally set to be a five-part series entitled Destiny,[79] it was split into two simultaneously published series, titled Alliance and Defiance. Alliance is drawn by Milne and began in December 2008; it focuses on the human and Autobot perspectives.[80] Defiance, which started the following month, is drawn by Dan Khanna and is set before either film, showing the beginnings of the war.[81] | After the 2007 film, and serving as a bridge between the two films, Alan Dean Foster wrote Transformers: The Veiled Threat,[82] originally titled Infiltration. During the writing, Foster collaborated with IDW to make sure their stories did not contradict each other.[83] | The first printed media directly related to the second film was a 32-page coloring and activity book by publisher HarperCollins, which became available on May 5, 2009 and was the first official source to openly give out key plot points to the film.[84] On June 1, 2009 DK Publishing published a 96-page book entitled Transformers: The Movie Universe, which intended to provide factual data on the characters of the film.[85] | On June 10, 2009, the comic book adaptation of the film, written by Simon Furman was released.[86] Additionally, Alan Dean Foster also wrote the novelization for the film.[87] Meanwhile, Dan Jolley wrote Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The Junior Novel, a 144-page book oriented at a younger audience than the one by Foster.[88] Lastly, a book titled Transformers: The Art of the Movies was released, documenting behind-the scenes aspects of the making of the film. | Other minor tie-in publications include Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The Last Prime, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The Reusable Sticker Book, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Made You Look!, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Rise of the Decepticons, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Spot the 'Bots', Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Mix and Match, Operation Autobot, When Robots Attack and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 2010 Wall Calendar. | Revenge of the Fallen video games are available on the following platforms: | PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (Developed by Luxoflux and published by Activision)[89][90] | Games for Windows (Developed by Beenox), which is similar to the PS3 and Xbox 360 version[91] | Wii and PlayStation 2 (Developed by Krome Studios)[92] | PlayStation Portable (Developed by Savage Entertainment)[93] | Nintendo DS (Developed by Vicarious Visions), which is separated into two games, Autobots and Decepticons.[94]","m_reference":"^ \"TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN (12A)\".
