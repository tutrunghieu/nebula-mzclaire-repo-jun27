{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the swamps of Louisiana, Dr. Alec Holland works with his sister Linda on a top-secret bio-engineering project to create a plant/animal hybrid capable of thriving in extreme environments. Government agent Alice Cable arrives just as Holland makes a major breakthrough, and begins to develop feelings for him. However, a paramilitary group led by the evil Dr. Anton Arcane, who is obsessed with immortality, kills Linda while trying to steal the formula for their own purposes. During the attack, Alice escapes and Alec is covered in chemicals, caught on fire, and runs screaming in the swamp, presumably to die. However, he returns as a monstrously mutated plant creature. As the Swamp Thing, Holland battles Arcane's forces to protect Cable, and eventually takes on Arcane himself, also mutated by the Holland formula.","m_cast":"Ray Wise as Alec Holland | Adrienne Barbeau as Alice Cable (a female version of Matt Cable but in place of Swamp Thing's comic book love interest Abby Arcane, who however appears in the sequel) | Louis Jourdan as Anton Arcane | Dick Durock as Swamp Thing | David Hess as Ferret | Nicholas Worth as Bruno | Don Knight as Harry Ritter | Al Ruban as Charlie | Ben Bates as Arcane Monster | Nannette Brown as Dr. Linda Holland | Reggie Batts as Jude | Mimi Craven as Arcane's Secretary (as Mimi Meyer) | Karen Price as Karen | Bill Erickson as Young Agent | Dov Gottesfeld as Commando | Tommy Madden as Little Bruno | Garry Westcott as Louis Jourdan's Stand-in and Stuntman","m_reception":"Swamp Thing received generally average to positive reviews from critics, with the movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retroactively giving the film a score of 64% based on 33 reviews.[2] Roger Ebert gave the film three out of a possible four stars, saying \"There's beauty in this movie, if you know where to look for it.\"[3] | Author John Kenneth Muir notes that Swamp Thing differs in many respects from Craven's usual work, in that Craven's intent was to show the major Hollywood studios that he could handle action, stunts and major stars.[4] Craven substituted his usual focus on the problems of the family and society for pure entertainment.[5] Nevertheless, Muir points out, some of Craven's usual themes and images do appear in Swamp Thing. For example, as in The Last House on the Left (1972), and The Hills Have Eyes (1977), Craven shows a close connection between the landscape and his characters.[6] The film was adapted in comic form as Swamp Thing Annual #1. | PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III wrote \"As much fun as this film can be (and it often is), it's equally often difficult to ignore that Swamp Thing ultimately is, at core, a rubber-suit monster movie.\"[7]","m_production":"Filming occurred primarily on location in Charleston, South Carolina, and nearby Johns Island.
