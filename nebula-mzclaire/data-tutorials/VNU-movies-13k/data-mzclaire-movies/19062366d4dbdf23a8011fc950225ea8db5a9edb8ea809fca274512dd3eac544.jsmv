{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American exchange student who has come to Paris to study French. While at the Cinémathèque Française protesting the firing of Henri Langlois, he meets the free-spirited twins Théo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green). The three bond over a shared love of film. | After dinner with their parents (Anna Chancellor and Robin Renucci), Théo and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends. | Matthew soon becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally (which one reviewer described as \"incestuous in all but the most technical sense\"[2]). After Théo loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a Marlene Dietrich poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is forced to take Isabelle's virginity. The two then become lovers. | Matthew begins to accept Théo and Isabelle's sexuality and his time living with them soon becomes idyllic. The three break the world record for running through the Louvre, and Matthew and Théo engage in playful arguments about Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the subject of Maoism, which Théo fervently believes in. Matthew and Isabelle also continue their relationship, although Matthew attempts to take her on regular dates, which she has not experienced before. | One night, while the three are sleeping naked together in the living room, Théo and Isabelle's parents arrive to leave a cheque for groceries. They are startled and disturbed by what they find. After they leave, Isabelle wakes up and discovers the cheque, realizing that their parents have found them. Wordlessly, she attaches a hose to the gas outlet and lies back down with Théo and Matthew, attempting to commit suicide. After a few moments, however, they are woken by a brick being hurled through the window; they discover hundreds of students rioting in the streets. Théo is overjoyed, but Matthew attempts to argue that the riots have no meaning. As a result, he is shunned by Théo and Isabelle, who rush to join the protesters. | As Matthew mournfully walks away through the chaos, Théo takes Isabelle's hand and hurls a molotov cocktail at a line of police. The film ends as the police charge the crowd.","m_cast":"Michael Pitt as Matthew | Eva Green as Isabelle | Louis Garrel as Théo | Anna Chancellor as Mother | Robin Renucci as Father | Jean-Pierre Kalfon as Himself | Jean-Pierre Leaud as Himself | Florian Cadiou as Patrick | Pierre Hancisse as First buff | Valentin Merlet as Second buff | Lola Peploe as The Usherette | Ingy Fillion as Théo's girlfriend | Aleksandra Kacprzak (uncredited) as Student May 1968 | Jean-Paul Belmondo (uncredited, archive footage) as Himself | Henri Langlois (uncredited, archive footage) as Himself | François Truffaut (uncredited, archive footage) as Himself","m_reception":"Among the reviews gathered by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 61% gave it a \"fresh rating\", based on an average of 6.2/10.[5] The 40 reviews gathered by Metacritic gave it an average score of 62/100, which places the film in the website's \"generally favorable\" category.[6] A.O. Scott of The New York Times said the film was \"disarmingly sweet and completely enchanting\" and described it as \"fus[ing] sexual discovery with political tumult by means of a heady, heedless romanticism that nearly obscures the film's patient, skeptical intelligence\".[2] The Times called it a \"heady blend of Last Tango and Stealing Beauty, but one that combines the grubbily voyeuristic elements of each film rather than their relative strengths\".[7] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, his highest rating, describing the film as \"poignant\" and \"extraordinarily beautiful\".[8]","m_production":"The first draft of the screenplay was an adaptation by Gilbert Adair of his own novel, The Holy Innocents. During pre-production, Bertolucci made changes to it: he \"peppered the narrative with clips from the films he loves\" and dropped homosexual content – including scenes from the novel that depict Matthew and Théo having sex – which he felt was \"just too much.\" After the film was released, he said that it was \"faithful to the spirit of the book but not the letter.\"[3] | Eva Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role of Isabelle, concerned that the film – which features full frontal nudity and graphic sex scenes – would cause her career to \"have the same destiny as Maria Schneider.\"[3] | When Green saw a rough cut of the film, she said she was \"quite shocked\" and had to look away during the sex scenes; she later told an interviewer that for her, \"it was as though I was wearing a costume while we were making the film. It was as if I had another story in my mind. So I was left speechless.\"[3] | Fox Searchlight Pictures gave the uncut version a limited theatrical release in the United States in 2004; it played in 116 theaters at its peak.[4] In the United States, the film was released theatrically with an NC-17 rating[4] whereas in Italy the same film was rated VM14. Even with its NC-17 rating, this film grossed $2.5 million in its United States theatrical release – a respectable result for a specialized film with a targeted audience.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Holy Innocents  by Gilbert Adair","m_directed_by":"Bernardo Bertolucci","m_produced_by":"Jeremy Thomas","m_screenplay_by":"Gilbert Adair","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Pitt Eva Green Louis Garrel","m_music_by":"(see Music and soundtrack)","m_cinematography":"Fabio Cianchetti","m_edited_by":"Jacopo Quadri","m_production_company":"Recorded Picture Company Peninsula Films","m_distributed_by":"TFM Distribution (France) Medusa Distribuzione (Italy) Fox Searchlight Pictures","m_release_dates":"10 October 2003 (2003-10-10) (Italy) | 10 December 2003 (2003-12-10) (France) | 6 February 2004 (2004-02-06) |  | ","m_running_time":"115 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom France Italy","m_language":"English French","m_budget":"$15 million[1]","m_box_office":"$15,121,165[1] | The Dreamers is a 2003 romantic drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.
