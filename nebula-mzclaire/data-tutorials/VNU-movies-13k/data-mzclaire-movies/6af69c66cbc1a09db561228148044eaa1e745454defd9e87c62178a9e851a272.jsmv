{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Daniel LaRusso and his mother Lucille move from Newark, New Jersey to Reseda, Los Angeles, California. Their apartment complex's repairman is an eccentric but kind and humble Okinawan immigrant named Kesuke Miyagi. | Daniel befriends Ali Mills, a high school cheerleader, which draws the attentions of her arrogant ex-boyfriend, Johnny Lawrence, a skilled practitioner of karate and member of Cobra Kai, a karate dojo. After Daniel tries to defend Ali, Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang begin to bother and harass him. Daniel fights back in self-defense until Mr. Miyagi intervenes and single-handedly fends off the five attackers with ease. Amazed, Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to teach him to fight. Miyagi refuses, but agrees to bring Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo to resolve the conflict. They meet with the sensei, John Kreese, an ex-Special Forces Vietnam veteran, who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the Under-18 All-Valley Karate Tournament, where he can compete with Johnny and the other Cobra Kai students on equal terms, and requests that the bullying cease while Daniel trains. Kreese agrees to the terms, but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will resume and Miyagi himself will also become a target. | Daniel's training starts with menial chores that he believes only makes him Miyagi's slave. When he becomes frustrated, it is explained that these actions have helped him to learn defensive blocks through muscle memory. Their bond develops and Daniel learns about Miyagi's dual loss of his wife and son in childbirth at Manzanar internment camp while he was serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment during World War II in Europe, where he received the Medal of Honor, the Army's highest award for valor. Through Miyagi's teaching, Daniel learns not only karate but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies the life lessons that Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. | At the tournament, Daniel surprises everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against a highly skilled opponent. Kreese instructs Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely injuring Daniel and getting disqualified in the process. Daniel is taken to the locker room, with the physician determining that he cannot continue, but Daniel believes that if he does not continue, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. He convinces Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to allow him to finish the tournament. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Ali tells the master of ceremonies that Daniel will fight and Daniel hobbles into the ring. The match is a seesaw battle, as neither is able to break through the other's defenses. | The match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor leg technique to trip Johnny, deliver a blow to the back of the head and give Johnny a nose bleed. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel's injured leg, an unethical move. Johnny is horrified at the order, but reluctantly agrees under Kreese's intimidation. As the match resumes, Johnny seizes Daniel's leg and delivers a vicious blow, doing further damage. Daniel, standing with difficulty, assumes the \"Crane\" stance, a technique he observed Miyagi performing on the beach. Johnny lunges toward Daniel, who jumps and delivers a front kick to Johnny's chin, winning the tournament. Johnny, having gained newfound respect for his nemesis, takes Daniel's trophy from the master of ceremonies and presents it to Daniel himself as Miyagi, Ali, Daniel's mother, and all Daniel's friends celebrate his victory.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Karate Kid ranked #40 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies.[9] The film retains a 90% \"Certified Fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 42 reviews.[10] | On its release, Roger Ebert called the film one of the year's best, gave it four stars out of four, and described it as an \"exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time.\"[11] Janet Maslin of The New York Times also gave a positive review.[12] | Upon release of the 2010 remake, Dana Stevens wrote, \"The 1984 original ... may have seemed like a standard-issue inspirational sports picture at the time, but (as with another box-office hit of the same year, The Terminator) a generation of remove reveals what a well-crafted movie it actually was.

Mako was also considered for the role of Mr. Miyagi, but was not available due to prior commitments to film Conan the Destroyer, though he would eventually play a similar role in the film Sidekicks. | The musical score for The Karate Kid was composed by Bill Conti, a frequent collaborator of director John G. Avildsen since their initial pairing on Rocky (1976). The instrumental score was orchestrated by Jack Eskew and featured pan flute solos by Gheorge Zamfir. On March 12, 2007, Varèse Sarabande released all four Karate Kid scores in a 4-CD box set limited to 2,500 copies worldwide.[6] | A soundtrack album was released in 1984 by Casablanca Records containing many of the contemporary songs featured in the film. Of particular note is Joe Esposito's \"You're the Best\", featured during the tournament montage near the end of the first film. Originally written for Rocky III, \"You're the Best\" was rejected by Sylvester Stallone in favor of Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\". Coincidentally, Survivor also performed the main theme (\"The Moment of Truth\" Music & Lyrics: Bill Conti, Dennis Lambert, Peter Beckett) for The Karate Kid. | Bananarama's 1984 hit song \"Cruel Summer\" also made its first U.S. appearance in The Karate Kid but was excluded from the film's soundtrack album.
