{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the near future war rages across the fictional Republic of Gilead and pollution has rendered 99% of the population sterile. Kate is a woman attempting to emigrate to Canada with her husband and daughter. While attempting to take a dirt road, they are caught by the Gilead Border Guard, who orders them to turn back or they will open fire. Kate's husband uses an automatic rifle to draw the fire, telling Kate to run, but he gets shot, Kate gets captured, whilst their daughter wanders off into the backcountry confused and unaccompanied. The authorities take Kate to a training facility with several other women, where they are all trained to become a Handmaid, a concubine for one of the privileged but barren couples who rule the country's religious fundamentalist regime. Although she resists being indoctrinated into the cult of the Handmaids, mixing Old Testament orthodoxy and misogyny with 12-step gospel and ritualized violence, Kate is soon assigned to the home of the Commander and his cold, inflexible wife, Serena Joy. There she is renamed \"Offred\" - \"of Fred\". | Her role as concubine is emotion-free, as she lies between Serena Joy's legs while being penetrated by the Commander, in hopes that she will bear them a child. Kate continually longs for her earlier life, and is haunted by nightmares of her husband's death and daughter's disappearance. She soon learns that many of the nation's male leaders are as sterile as their wives. Serena Joy desperately wants a baby, so she convinces Kate to risk the punishment for fornication — death by hanging — in order to be fertilized by another man who will make her pregnant, and subsequently, spare her life. In exchange for agreeing to this, Serena Joy provides information to Kate that her daughter is alive, and shows a recent photograph of her as proof, living with another Commander. However, Kate is told she can never see her daughter. The Commander also tries to get closer to Kate, in the sense he feels if she enjoyed herself more she would be a better handmaid. The Commander gets Kate hard to obtain items, and, having realized her background as a librarian, allows her access to his private library. However, during a night out, the Commander has sex with Kate in a manner that is probably not intended for pregnancy. The other man selected by Serena Joy turns out to be Nick, the Commander's sympathetic chauffeur. Kate grows attached to him and eventually becomes pregnant with his child. | Kate ultimately kills the Commander, then is taken away by a police unit. She thinks that the men are the Eyes, the government's secret police. However, it turns out that they are soldiers from the resistance movement, which Nick, too, is a part of. Kate then flees with them, leaving Nick behind in an emotional scene. | In the closing scene, Kate is once again free and wearing her own clothes, but facing an uncertain future. She is living by herself, pregnant in a trailer whilst receiving intelligence reports from the rebels. She wonders if she will be reunited with Nick, but expresses hope that will happen, and resolves with the rebels' help she will find her daughter.","m_cast":"Natasha Richardson as Kate / Offred | Robert Duvall as Commander | Faye Dunaway as Serena Joy | Elizabeth McGovern as Moira | Aidan Quinn as Nick | Victoria Tennant as Aunt Lydia | Blanche Baker as Ofglen | Traci Lind as Janine / Ofwarren | Reiner Schöne as Luke | Robert D.

Hudgins: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for The Handmaid's Tale, which he has decided not to publish. When his script for Remains of the Day was radically revised by the James Ivory–Ismail Merchant partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\" (Gale, Films 125). | ^ Hudgins, 132 | ^ Referring to Pinter's screenplay for the film of John Fowles's novel The French Lieutenant's Woman, Gale observes: \"Although in other films he has used a voice-over narrator, the obvious choice for retaining the Fowles touch, Pinter is on record as not being fond of the device, and he wanted to avoid it here if possible\" (Sharp Cut 239); in relation to his screenplay for Lolita, \"Despite the director's wanting him to use a good bit of that narrative as voice-over in the film, Pinter insist[ed] that he would never use it in a description of action … [and, Gale describes] how he put his opinion into practice\" (358). Gale discusses the use of voice-over in or relating to other screenplays by Pinter, including those that he wrote for Accident, The Comfort of Strangers (in which Richardson also stars), The Go-Between, The Last Tycoon, The Remains of the Day, and The Trial (198–99, 234, 327, 353-54, 341, 367), as well as the voice overs that he did write for his script of The Handmaid's Tale: The novel does not include the murder of the Commander, and Kate's fate is left completely unresolved—the van waits in the driveway, \"and so I step up, into the darkness within; or else the light\" ([Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986)] 295). The escape to Canada and the reappearance of the child and Nick are Pinter's inventions for the movie version. As shot, there is a voice-over in which Kate explains (accompanied by light symphonic music that contrasts with that of the opening scene) that she is now safe in the mountains held by the rebels. Bolstered by occasional messages from Nick, she awaits the birth of her baby while she dreams about Jill, whom she feels she is going to find eventually.
