{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Draenor, the homeworld of the orcs, is being torn apart by a mysterious force known as fel magic. An orc warlock known as Gul'dan unites the orc clans and forms the Horde, and creates a portal to the world of Azeroth. The orcs begin to use fel magic to drain the life out of captive draenei in order to sustain the portal. Once it is operational, Gul'dan leads a small warband to capture prisoners on Azeroth and sacrifice them to bring the rest of the Horde through the portal. Despite their doubts, Durotan, the chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, his pregnant mate Draka, and his friend Orgrim Doomhammer join this initial warband. While crossing through the portal, Draka goes into labor. When the orcs arrive on Azeroth, Gul'dan assists Draka with giving birth, but the baby is stillborn. Gul'dan then drains the life out of a nearby deer to revive and infuse fel magic into the baby, which Durotan later names Go'el. | The orcs raid several settlements throughout Azeroth. Anduin Lothar, the military commander of the human forces in the Stormwind Kingdom, looks over some of the men that were killed, and finds a trespassing mage named Khadgar, who explains that he was investigating the dead bodies because they contained traces of fel magic. Khadgar persuades Stormwind's king, Llane Wrynn, to consult Medivh, the fabled Guardian of Tirisfal, and Llane sends Anduin and Khadgar to Medivh's stronghold, Karazhan, to inform him of the fel magic's presence on Azeroth. In the Karazhan library, a ghostly shadow leads Khadgar to a mysterious book, which he takes. | Anduin, Khadgar and Medivh join a scouting team following traces of fel magic, but are ambushed by orcs. Medivh uses a spell to kill most of the orcs, and the Horde's warchief, Blackhand, flees, along with Durotan and Orgrim. Khadgar restrains the half-orc known as Garona, and the soldiers take her prisoner. King Llane frees Garona in exchange for loyalty to Stormwind, and she leads the humans to spy on the orc camp, where they learn of Gul'dan's plan to bring the Horde to Azeroth. Meanwhile, Durotan realizes that the fel magic is responsible for the destruction of Draenor, and if Gul'dan is not thwarted, Azeroth will suffer the same fate. Despite Orgrim's objections, Durotan invites Llane to a secret meeting so that the Frostwolf Clan and the humans can unite to defeat Gul'dan. While studying the book he took from Karazhan, Khadgar learns that Gul'dan could not have opened the portal on his own; he had help from someone on Azeroth. He is confronted by Medivh, who burns Khadgar's research when Khadgar offers to help him with his work. | The Frostwolf Clan meets with the humans to negotiate an alliance, but the group is ambushed by Blackhand. As the humans retreat, Medivh forms a magical barrier to protect them, but Lothar's son Callan is separated from the rest of the group and killed by Blackhand. Medivh is severely weakened, and Garona and Khadgar take him back to Karazhan to recover. After noticing Medivh's eyes shine green, showing that he is infected by fel magic, Khadgar returns to his former home, Dalaran, to seek help from a group of human magi called the Kirin Tor. Alodi, a legendary mage and the true identity of the shadow who led Khadgar to the book, reveals that Medivh has indeed been corrupted by fel magic and possessed by an unknown demon. At the orc camp, Blackhand purges the Frostwolf Clan. Orgrim helps Draka to escape, and she sends Go'el down a river in a basket, but is then found and killed by another orc. Durotan challenges Gul'dan to Mak'gora, a traditional orcish duel to the death for leadership of a clan â€“ in this case, all of the orcs. During the fight, Gul'dan violates the honorable combat rules by draining the life out of Durotan with his magic, killing him and earning the disapproval of the orcs watching, and he empowers Blackhand with the same magic. Medivh, now in a half-demonic state, starts to open the portal to Draenor, and Gul'dan sacrifices the captured human villagers to allow the rest of the Horde to enter Azeroth. | Llane leads the human army in an assault on the orc camp, while Anduin and Khadgar fight Medivh and destroy the demon that had begun to manifest on the outside. Medivh is left mortally wounded, and uses the last of his strength to close the portal to Draenor and instead open a portal to Stormwind, allowing Llane to evacuate most of the freed prisoners. When Medivh eventually dies, the portal closes, leaving Llane, Garona and a small number of human soldiers to fight the orcs. Llane secretly orders Garona to kill him, bringing her honor among the orcs and putting her in a position of power to bring peace between the two races. Garona reluctantly does so, and is welcomed into the Horde by Gul'dan. As the orcs celebrate, Anduin arrives to retrieve King Llane's body and discovers Garona's knife in the body, realizing that it was she who had killed their king. Blackhand challenges Anduin to Mak'gora, and Anduin quickly disposes of him. Against Gul'dan's demands, the orcs, bound by tradition, allow Anduin to depart with Llane's body. At Llane's funeral in Stormwind, the leaders of the other human nations, along with the high elves and dwarves, proclaim an alliance against the orcs and rally behind Anduin as the leader of the Alliance forces. Elsewhere, Orgrim takes one of Durotan's tusks to one day give to Go'el, and the basket containing Go'el is found by a human.","m_cast":"Travis Fimmel as Sir Anduin Lothar, the military commander of the human forces in Stormwind Kingdom.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Warcraft has visual thrills to spare, but they â€“ and director Duncan Jones' distinctive gifts â€“ are wasted on a sluggish and derivative adaptation of a bestselling game with little evident cinematic value.\"[73] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 32 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[8] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[44] | Geoff Berkshire of Variety criticized the film's attempts at adapting a source material with \"inherent ridiculousness\" in regards to how the original game series was not meant to have a very deep narrative: \"[I]t's an unwaveringly earnest film that never owns up to exactly how campy every character, every conflict and every new realm truly is.\"[74] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club wrote that, \"To watch Warcraft is never to be transported, but to wade through a thick morass of mythology, exposition, gaudy light-show effects, half-assed character development, and formulaic franchise groundwork,\" while describing director/cowriter Duncan Jones as \"a talented sci-fi fabulist whoâ€™s fallen screaming into the same CGI abyss that consumed Peter Jackson during his unfortunate Hobbit cycle.\"[75] Helen O'Hara, reviewing for the UK-based GQ Magazine, stated that although the film itself is a \"strong adaptation\" of Warcraft, the script diminishes the film's impact: \"The problem is that it just can't escape those cod-fantasy roots. There are too many mysterious proper nouns being thrown into conversation and at least 12 major characters competing for space â€¦ [W]e're zipping from one to another here so quickly that they only have time for the most portentous, and sometimes clichÃ©d, dialogue.\"[76] | Dave Robinson of Crash Landed, however, praised the film's depiction of the Orc race and the motion capture performances by the actors.[77]","m_production":"The project was officially announced in May 2006[6] and was originally set to take place in the era of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. This setting, however, was later dropped, with Blizzard feeling that it would be too similar to The Lord of the Rings.[12] Initially scheduled for a 2009 release, the film was later delayed to 2011.[13] However, by Comicon 2011, the film was announced to still be in the \"Treatment stage\".[14] | Uwe Boll made a bid to direct, but was turned away by Blizzard, who he claims to have said, \"We will not sell the movie rights, not to youâ€¦ especially not to you. Because it's such a big online game success, maybe a bad movie would destroy that ongoing income, what the company has with it.\"[15] Sam Raimi was initially attached to direct,[16][17] but was replaced by Duncan Jones in January 2013.[18] Upon coming aboard, Jones immediately voiced his displeasure at the script, which he stated \"was the stale fantasy trope of, humans are the good guys, monsters are the bad guys\". With Blizzard's approval (who had also been looking to change the story), Jones altered the story so that \"It's 50-50.\"[19] Jones also faced personal struggles during filming, as his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after Jones took over, and his father, David Bowie, died from cancer late in production. Jones thus summed up the challenge by telling The New York Times, \"My film started and ended with cancer.\"[19] At San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, a concept trailer was presented, featuring a battle between a human and an orc.[20] | On September 23, 2013, it was reported that actors Paul Dano, Travis Fimmel, Anson Mount, and Anton Yelchin were on the shortlist to star in the film. In October 2013, Fimmel was announced to play the lead character.[21][22] On December 4, 2013, the main cast of the film, consisting of Fimmel, Ben Foster, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell and Rob Kazinsky, was announced. On December 14, 2013, Universal added Daniel Wu and Clancy Brown to the cast.[23] In early March 2014, newcomer Burkely Duffield joined the cast.[24] Many of the casting announcements were made at a panel presentation during BlizzCon 2014. | Principal photography began on January 13, 2014, and lasted for four months, finishing on May 23, 2014.[25][26] Filming took place primarily in Vancouver, among other locations.[27] Post-production lasted twenty months.[28] Regarding the use of computer-generated imagery, Jones said, \"It's a tool like any other. It can be done well and it can be done shit. The best CGI has you forgetting [that] it's CGI, and accepting the visual as whatever it is supposed to beâ€”like props. No one has an issue with props in film, do they?\"[29] | In October 2014, Jones and Legendary Pictures hired Ramin Djawadi as the composer for the film.[30]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"WarcraftÂ  by Blizzard Entertainment","m_directed_by":"Duncan Jones","m_produced_by":"Thomas Tull | Jon Jashni | Charles Roven | Alex Gartner | Stuart Fenegan","m_screenplay_by":"Charles Leavitt | Duncan Jones","m_story_by":"Chris Metzen","m_starring":"Travis Fimmel | Paula Patton | Ben Foster | Dominic Cooper | Toby Kebbell | Ben Schnetzer | Robert Kazinsky | Daniel Wu","m_music_by":"Ramin Djawadi","m_cinematography":"Simon Duggan","m_edited_by":"Paul Hirsch","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Universal Pictures","m_release_dates":"JuneÂ 6,Â 2016Â (2016-06-06) (TCL Chinese Theatre) | JuneÂ 10,Â 2016Â (2016-06-10) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"123 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$160 million[2]","m_box_office":"$422 million[3] | Warcraft (alternatively known as Warcraft: The Beginning)[4] is a 2016 American fantasy film directed by Duncan Jones and written by Jones, Charles Leavitt and Chris Metzen.
