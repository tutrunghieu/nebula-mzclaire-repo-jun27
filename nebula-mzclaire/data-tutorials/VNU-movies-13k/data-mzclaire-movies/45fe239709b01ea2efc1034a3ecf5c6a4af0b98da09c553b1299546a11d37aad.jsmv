The film went on to gross a total of $5,696,391 in North America.[3] | Under Fire received a positive response from critics and holds an 88% positive \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[4] | Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the performances and declaring it one of the year's best films, saying, \"The actors in Under Fire never step wrong. Nolte is great to watch as the seedy photographer with the beer gut. Hackman never really convinced me that he could be an anchorman, but he did a better thing. He convinced me that he thought he could be one. Joanna Cassidy takes a role that could have been dismissed as 'the girl' and fills it out as a fascinating, textured adult. Under Fire surrounds these performances with a vivid sense of place and becomes, somewhat surprisingly, one of the year's best films.\"[5] Geoff Andrew of Time Out praised the film as \"tak[ing] an honourable place alongside classic war-torn romance pictures like Casablanca and To Have and Have Not\" and concluded, calling it \"a thrilling film, with a head, a heart, and muscle.\"[6] | Vincent Canby of The New York Times, however, viewed the film less favorably, saying \"Under Fire, which was written by Ron Shelton and Clayton Frohman, from a story by Mr. Frohman, means well but it is fatally confused. It's silly enough to use a real, bloody war as the backdrop - the excuse, really - for the raising of the consciousnesses of a couple of mini-characters.\"[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Roger Spottiswoode","m_produced_by":"Jonathan Taplin","m_screenplay_by":"Clayton Frohman | Ron Shelton","m_story_by":"Clayton Frohman","m_starring":"Nick Nolte | Gene Hackman | Joanna Cassidy | Jean-Louis Trintignant | Richard Masur | Ed Harris","m_music_by":"Jerry Goldsmith","m_cinematography":"John Alcott","m_edited_by":"Mark Conte | John Bloom","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures","m_release_dates":"October 21, 1983 (1983-10-21)","m_running_time":"128 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English, Spanish","m_budget":"$9.5 million","m_box_office":"$5,696,391 | Under Fire is a 1983 political film set during the last days of the Nicaraguan Revolution that ended the Somoza regime in 1979 Nicaragua.
