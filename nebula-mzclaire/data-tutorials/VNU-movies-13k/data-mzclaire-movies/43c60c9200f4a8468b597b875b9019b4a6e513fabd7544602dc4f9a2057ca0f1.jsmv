{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The Numata family consists of the father, Kōsuke (Juzo Itami); mother, Chikako (Saori Yuki); and two sons, Shinichi (Jun'ichi Tsujita) and Shigeyuki (Ichirōta Miyagawa). Shigeyuki is a junior high school student. He will soon be taking a high school entrance examination. Unlike the high school student brother, Shinichi, who lives up to the father's expectations, Shigeyuki’s grades are poor, and he is only interested in roller coasters. The father finds a private tutor, Yoshimoto (Yusaku Matsuda), for Shigeyuki and imposes all responsibilities for his exam on the tutor. Yoshimoto's behaviour is extremely strange, including kissing Shigeyuki and hitting him painfully hard. Even though Yoshimoto is a seventh year student of a third-rate university, Shigeyuki’s marks become better and better. Eventually he passes the exam for the high school. At a family celebration, Yoshimoto begins to riot, hitting people, pouring wine on their heads, and throwing spaghetti around wildly.","m_cast":"Yusaku Matsuda as Katsu Yoshimoto | Juzo Itami as Kōsuke Numata | Saori Yuki as Chikako Numata | Ichirōta Miyagawa as Shigeyuki Numata | Junichi Tsujita as Shinichi Numata, the older brother | Yoko Aki as Yoshimoto's girlfriend","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Yoshimitsu Morita","m_produced_by":"Yutaka Okada Shirō Sasaki","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Yusaku Matsuda Juzo Itami Saori Yuki","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Yonezo Maeda","m_edited_by":"Akimasa Kawashima","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Circle Films","m_release_dates":"4 June 1983 (1983-06-04) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"107 minutes","m_country":null,"m_language":"Japanese | The Family Game (家族ゲーム, Kazoku Gēmu?) is a 1983 Japanese movie directed by Yoshimitsu Morita.
