{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Lucas (Nolte) has been in prison for armed robbery. On the day he is released, he gets taken hostage by Ned Perry (Short), an incompetent, novice criminal who robs a bank (to get money for treatment for his ill daughter, Meg) at the moment Lucas just happens to be there. | Detective Duggan (Jones) assumes they must be in it together and sets about tracking them down. Several chases, an accidental shooting, treatment from a crazy vet who thinks he's a dog and other capers follow, all the while Lucas trying to ditch his idiotic companion and prove his own innocence. | Whilst avoiding the law, the two form an unlikely partnership to help cure the silent Meg and make good their escape. They rescue Meg from the care home she's in (with Perry nearly ruining the whole affair with his clumsiness) and flee for Canada, pretending to be a married couple with a son. | All appears to end well. However, in the closing scene, Perry enters a Canadian bank to change some currency only to find himself taken hostage by a different bank robber in the same manner he originally kidnapped Lucas. Because of this unexpected development, Lucas does not need to say goodbye to Meg, with whom he has formed a bond.","m_cast":"Nick Nolte: Daniel James Lucas | Martin Short: Ned Perry | James Earl Jones: Detective Movan Duggan | Alan Ruck: Inspector Tenner | Sarah Doroff: Meghan \"Meg\" Perry | Kenneth McMillan: Horvath | David Arnott: Bank Teller | Lee Garlington: Constable Jane Karie | Bruce McGill: Charlie | Sy Richardson: Tucker | Rocky Giordani: Bowles | Stanley Brock: Release Sergent | Rick Hall: Dog Handler Billy | Brian Thompson: Second Thug | Jack McGee: Fisherman | Kathy Kinney: Receptionist | Larry Miller: Street Cop | Jeff Perry: Orderly #2 | Scott Lincoln: Passenger Cop | Dinah Lenney: Reporter #1 | John Aylward: Second Cop | Tim De Zarn: First Cop | Rhoda Gemignani: Radio Announcer | Charles Noland: Bartender Dave | Albert Henderson: Man In Raincoat | Gary Armagnac: Cop #2 | Dean Smith: Barry \"Playboy\" Jones | Paul Tuerpe: Reporter #2 | Mike MacDonald: Sergeant Snow | Michael Siegel: Cop #4 | Phil Hartman: Joelien | Anderson Cooper and Lea Thompson have cameos in the film, although Cooper's role was before fame, and Thompson's was after Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future, and Howard the Duck.","m_reception":"The film received negative reviews from critics.
