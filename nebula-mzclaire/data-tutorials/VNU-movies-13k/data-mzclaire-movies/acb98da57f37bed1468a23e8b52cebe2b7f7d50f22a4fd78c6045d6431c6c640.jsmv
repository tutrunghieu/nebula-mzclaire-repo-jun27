{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with the contorted body of the woman, covered in frost. From this image, an unseen and unheard interviewer (the voice of Varda herself) puts the camera on the last men to see her and the ones who found her. The action then flashes back to the woman, Mona (Sandrine Bonnaire) walking along the roadside, hiding from the police and trying to get a ride. Along her journey she meets and takes up with other vagabonds such as herself as well as a Tunisian vineyard worker, a family of goat farmers, a professor researching trees, and a maid who envies what she perceives to be a beautiful and passionate lifestyle. Mona explains to one of her temporary companions that at one time she had an office job in Paris and did very well for herself, but she became unsettled with the way she was living – choosing instead to wander the country free from any responsibility, picking up what she could to survive as she goes. Throughout the film, Mona's condition seems to become progressively worse until she finally falls where we first saw her, frozen and entrenched in her misery in a ditch.","m_cast":"Sandrine Bonnaire as Mona Bergeron | Macha Meril as Mme Landier | Yolande Moreau as Yolande | Stéphane Freiss as Jean-Pierre | Setti Ramdane as Tunisian | Francis Balchère as Police | Jean-Louis Perletti as Police | Urbain Causse as Farmer | Christophe Alcazar as Farmer | Joël Fosse as Paulo | Patrick Schmit as Truck Driver | Daniel Bos as Demolition Worker | Katy Champaud as Girl at the Pump | Raymond Roulle as Old Man with Matches | Henri Fridlani as The Gravedigger | Patrick Sokol as Young Man with Sandwich | Pierre Imbert as Mechanic","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Agnès Varda","m_produced_by":"Oury Milshtein","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sandrine Bonnaire Macha Méril Yolande Moreau","m_music_by":"Joanna Bruzdowicz Fred Chichin","m_cinematography":"Patrick Blossier","m_edited_by":"Patricia Mazuy Agnès Varda","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"MK2 Diffusion","m_release_dates":"September 1985 (1985-09) (Venice) | 4 December 1985 (1985-12-04) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"105 minutes","m_country":"France","m_language":"French","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$6,5 million[1] | Vagabond (French: Sans toit ni loi, \"without roof nor law\") is a 1985 French drama film directed by Agnès Varda, featuring Sandrine Bonnaire.
