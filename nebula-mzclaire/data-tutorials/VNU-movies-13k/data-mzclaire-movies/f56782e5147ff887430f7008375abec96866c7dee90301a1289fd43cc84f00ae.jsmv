{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the winter of 1943–44, U.S. Army Brigadier General George Carnaby, a chief planner of the second front, is captured by the Germans when his aircraft is shot down en route to Crete. He is taken for interrogation to the Schloss Adler, a fortress high in the Alps of southern Bavaria. A team of Allied commandos, led by British Major John Smith (Richard Burton) and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), is briefed by Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark) and Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern) of MI6. Their mission is to parachute in, infiltrate the castle, and rescue General Carnaby (Robert Beatty) before the Germans can interrogate him. MI6 Agent Mary Elison (Mary Ure) accompanies the mission in secret, her presence known only to Major Smith. | Early in the mission, two of the operatives are mysteriously killed, but Major Smith is unperturbed, keeping Lt. Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland (Michael Hordern) and Turner on developments by radio. After seeming to give up and allowing themselves to be captured, Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the three remaining members of the group — Thomas (William Squire), Berkeley (Peter Barkworth) and Christiansen (Donald Houston). Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a supply depot, and prepare an escape route for later use before hitching a ride on top of a cable car — the only approach to the castle. Mary, posing as a maid, is brought into the castle by Heidi (Ingrid Pitt), a deep-cover agent working as a barmaid in the nearby village; Major von Hapen (Derren Nesbitt), a Gestapo officer whom Heidi has been cultivating, becomes infatuated with Mary. Mary sets a rope through one of the castle windows for Smith and Schaffer to climb. | Carnaby's interrogation, carried out by General Rosemeyer (Ferdy Mayne) and Colonel Kramer (Anton Diffring), is underway when the three other prisoners arrive and reveal themselves to be German double agents. Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith then forces Schaffer to disarm and establishes himself as Major Johann Schmidt of the SD — the SS intelligence branch. He exposes the true identity of \"General Carnaby\": Cartwright Jones, an American Corporal. He also claims that Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen are British impostors. To test them, Smith/Schmidt proposes they write down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to the personal list in his pocket (having discreetly shown the name of Germany's top agent in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it). After the three finish their lists, Smith reveals his own to Kramer, which is in fact blank. Smith and Schaffer re-secure the room, the former finally revealing the mission's true objective: the lists of names the agents had provided. | Mary, while preparing the explosives, is visited by von Hapen; he takes her to the castle's cafe and persuades her to recite the tale of her assumed identity. Finding faults in her story, he investigates and happens upon the scene of Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Von Hapen puts the room under arrest, but is distracted by Mary's entrance, enabling Schaffer to draw a hidden pistol — killing von Hapen and the other German officers. The group then makes its escape, taking the three agents as prisoners. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the compound, while Smith leads the group to the radio room, where he informs Rolland of their success. They then head to the cable car station, sacrificing Thomas as a decoy. Berkeley and Christiansen attempt their own escape in a cable car, but are thwarted and killed by Smith. The group eventually reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they had prepared earlier as an escape vehicle. With enemy soldiers in hot pursuit, they battle their way to the airfield and finally escape on a disguised extraction plane, in which Col. Turner is waiting for them. | Smith briefs Turner on the mission, and reveals a suspicion he and Rolland had shared since before the start: that Turner is the Nazis' top agent in Britain, which had been confirmed by the late Colonel Kramer. Turner had been lured into participating so MI6 could expose him, with Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer (who had no connection to MI6) specially assigned to the team to ensure the mission's success. To avoid a trial and execution, Turner is permitted by Smith to save face and commit suicide by jumping out of the plane without a parachute.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film earned $6,560,000 in rentals at the North American box office during its first year of release.[23] It was the 7th-most popular film at the UK box office in 1969, and 13th in the US.[24] The film was particularly lucrative for Richard Burton, who earned a considerable sum in royalties through television repeats and video sales.[25] Where Eagles Dare had its first showing on British television on 26 December 1979 on BBC1. In 2009 Cinema Retro magazine released a special issue dedicated to Where Eagles Dare which detailed the production and filming of the movie.[26]","m_production":"Burton later said, \"I decided to do the picture because Elizabeth's two sons said they were fed up with me making films they weren't allowed to see, or in which I get killed. They wanted me to kill a few people instead.\"[4] Burton approached producer Elliott Kastner \"and asked him if he had some super-hero stuff for me where I don't get killed in the end.\"[5] The producer consulted MacLean and requested an adventure film filled with mystery, suspense, and action. Most of MacLean's novels had been made into films or were being filmed. Kastner persuaded MacLean to write a new story; six weeks later, he delivered the script, at that time entitled Castle of Eagles. Kastner hated the title, and chose Where Eagles Dare instead. The title[6] is from Act I, Scene III in William Shakespeare's Richard III: \"The world is grown so bad, that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch\". Like virtually all of MacLean's works, Where Eagles Dare features his trademark \"secret traitor\", who must be unmasked by the end. | Kastner and coproducer Jerry Gershwin announced in July 1966 that they had purchased five MacLean scripts, starting with Where Eagles Dare and When Eight Bells Toll.[7] | Brian Hutton had just made Sol Madrid for the producers and was signed to direct.[8] | Eastwood and Burton reportedly dubbed the film 'Where Doubles Dare' due to the amount of screen time in which stand-ins doubled for the cast during action sequences.[3] Filming began on 2 January 1968 in Austria and concluded in July 1968.[9] Eastwood received a salary of $800,000 while Burton received $1,200,000.[9][10] This is one of the first films to use front projection effect.[11] Specifically, this technology enabled filming of the scenes where the actors are on top of the cable car. | Eastwood initially opined that the script written by MacLean was \"terrible\" and was \"all exposition and complications\", and–according to Derren Nesbitt–requested that he be given less dialogue. Most of Schaffer's lines were given to Burton, whilst Eastwood handled most of the action scenes.[12] Director Hutton played to his actors' strengths, allowing for Burton's theatrical background to help the character of Smith and Eastwood's quiet demeanour to establish Schaffer. | Derren Nesbitt was keen to be as factual as possible with his character Von Hapen. Whilst on location, he requested to meet a former member of the Gestapo to better understand how to play the character and to get the military regalia correct. He was injured on set whilst filming the scene in which Schaffer kills Von Hapen. The blood squib attached to Nesbitt exploded with such force that he was temporarily blinded. Fortunately, he made a quick recovery.[12][13] | The production was delayed while filming due to the weather in Austria. Shooting took place in winter and early spring of 1968 and the crew had to contend with blizzards, sub-zero temperatures and potential avalanches. Further delays were incurred when Richard Burton, well known for his drinking habits, disappeared for several days with his friends Peter O'Toole and Richard Harris.[14] As part of his deal with MGM, Clint Eastwood took delivery of a Norton P11 motorcycle, which he 'tested' at Brands Hatch racetrack[1], accompanied by Ingrid Pitt, something that he had been forbidden from doing by Kastner for insurance purposes in case of injury or worse.[15] | Famed stuntman Alf Joint, who had played Capungo–the man whom 007 electrocuted in the bathtub in Goldfinger–doubled and was stand-in for Richard Burton, and performed the famous cable car jump sequence; in so doing, he lost three teeth.[14] | Visitors to the set included Elizabeth Taylor, who was married to Burton at the time, and Robert Shaw, who was then the husband of Mary Ure.[14] | The Junkers Ju-52 used to fly Smith and Schaffer's team into Austria and then make their escape at the end of the film was a Swiss Air Force Ju-52/3m, registration A-702.[16] | the castle – Hohenwerfen Castle, Werfen, Austria; filmed in January 1968. | cable car – Feuerkogel Seilbahn at Ebensee, Austria; filmed in January 1968. | airport scenes – Flugplatz at Aigen im Ennstal, Austria; filmed in early 1968. The exact place of filming is the \"Fiala-Fernbrugg\" garrison, still used by HS Geschwader 2 and FlAR2/3rd Bat. of the Austrian Army. The big rocky mountain in the background of the airfield is the Grimming mountains, about 40 km east of the \"Hoher Dachstein\", or about 80 km east and 10 km south from Werfen.[17] | other scenes – MGM-British Studios, Borehamwood, England; filmed in spring 1968.[18]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Where Eagles Dare 1966 novel  by Alistair MacLean","m_directed_by":"Brian G.
