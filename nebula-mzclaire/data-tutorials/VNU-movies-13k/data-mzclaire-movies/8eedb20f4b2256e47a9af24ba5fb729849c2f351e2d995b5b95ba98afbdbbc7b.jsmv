{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A promiscuous and rather misogynistic man, Steve (Perry King) is murdered by one of his three ex-lovers, and after death, the powers that be cannot decide whether to send him to heaven or to hell—his life is full of good deeds, but he's \"been a shit\" to women, and that behavior is keeping him from going to heaven. The powers that be decide to give him a test; he is reincarnated and given a limited amount of time to have at least one woman like him. To make the test more difficult, he is reincarnated as a beautiful woman (Ellen Barkin) named Amanda. After the change, Amanda/Steve encounters other people, including Steve's friend Walter, whom Amanda convinces of the truth of her identity, and lesbian perfume magnate Sheila. Both become attracted to Amanda, but Amanda rebuffs Sheila's advances, even knowing that she is giving up an opportunity for a woman to love her, even though he had sex exclusively with women, as Steve, in the past. Later, Amanda and Walter get drunk together and end up having sex. In the morning, Amanda claims no memory of the sex and accuses Walter of raping her. Walter acts surprised and insists that Amanda was an enthusiastic participant. Amanda rejects Walter, but she learns shortly thereafter that she has become pregnant from the encounter. At the childbirth, the baby girl gazes upon her mother with love, and then Amanda dies, having earned her place in heaven.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film received mixed to negative reviews and holds a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[1] It debuted at No. 2 at the box office.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Blake Edwards","m_produced_by":"Tony Adams Executive Producer: Arnon Milchan Patrick Wachsberger Associate Producer: Trish Caroselli","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ellen Barkin | Jimmy Smits | JoBeth Williams | Lorraine Bracco","m_music_by":"Henry Mancini Don Grady","m_cinematography":"Dick Bush","m_edited_by":"Robert Pergament","m_production_company":"HBO Films","m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.
