{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Secret agent WD-40 Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) has his work cut out for him. Along with the mysterious and lovely Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14 (Nicollette Sheridan), he must rescue the kidnapped Barbara Dahl and stop the evil genius, a General named Rancor (Andy Griffith), from seizing control of the entire world. | Rancor was wounded in an earlier encounter and no longer has arms. However, he can \"arm\" himself by attaching robotic limbs with various weapons attached. Steele is talked out of retirement by an old friend, agent Steven Bishop (Robert Guillaume), and given his new assignment by The Director (Charles Durning), who also is testing out a variety of elaborate disguises. At headquarters, Steele encounters an old agency nemesis, Norm Coleman (Barry Bostwick), and flirts with the Director's adoring secretary, referred to as Miss Cheevus (Marcia Gay Harden). | On the job, Steele is assisted by an agent named Kabul (John Ales), who gives him rides in a never-ending variety of specially designed cars. They seek help from McLuckey (Mason Gamble), a blond child, home alone, who is very good at fending off intruders. Steele resists the temptations of a dangerous woman (Talisa Soto) he finds waiting for him in bed. But he does work very closely with Agent 3.14, whose father, Professor Ukrinsky (Elya Baskin), is also being held captive by Rancor. | Everything comes to an explosive conclusion at the General's remote fortress, where Steele rescues both Barbara Dahl (Stephanie Romanov) and Miss Cheevus and launches a literally disarmed Rancor into outer space, saving mankind. And Rancor have lost his legs.","m_cast":"Leslie Nielsen as Dick Steele, WD-40 | Nicollette Sheridan as Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14 | Charles Durning as The Director | Marcia Gay Harden as Miss Cheevus | Barry Bostwick as Norm Coleman | John Ales as Kabul | Andy Griffith as General Rancor | Elya Baskin as Professor Ukrinsky | Mason Gamble as McCluckey | Carlos Lauchu as Slice | Stephanie Romanov as Victoria and Barbara Dahl | Joyce Brothers as Steele's Tag Team Member | Ray Charles as Bus Driver | Hulk Hogan as Dick's tag-team partner | Roger Clinton as Agent Clinton | Robert Culp as Businessman | Fabio Lanzoni as Himself | Robert Guillaume as Steven Bishop | Pat Morita as Brian the Waiter | Talisa Soto as Desiree More | Mr. T as a helicopter pilot | Alex Trebek as Agency Tape Recorder (voice) | Taylor Negron as Painter | Clyde Kusatsu as Noggin | Curtis Armstrong as Pastry chef | Tina Arning as Dancer #1 | William Barillaro as Blind Driver | Michael Berryman as the man with the oxygen mask | Downtown Julie Brown as Cigarette Girl | Stephen Burrows as Agent Burrows | Keith Campbell as Thug #2 | Carl Ciarfalio as Thug #1 | Brad Grunberg as Postal Worker | Wayne Cotter as Male Dancer | Rick Cramer as Heimlich, Rancor Terrorist | Eddie Deezen as Rancor guard that gets spit on | Joey Dente as Goombah, Dead Wise Guy | Paul Eliopoulos as Agent #1 | Andrew Christian English as Paratrooper | Johnny G as Agent #2 | Michael Lee Gogin (Brad Garrett, voice) as Short Rancor guard | Bruce Gray as The President | John Kassir as Rancor guard at intercom | Sally Stevens as Vocal conductor/singer | Thuy Trang as a Hawaiian-dressed waitress | \"Weird Al\" Yankovic as Himself in title sequence | Larry Walsh as Musician | Rawle D.

The film received a \"rotten\" rating of 8% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews and a 3.4/10 rating.[3] | James Berardinelli of ReelViews wrote: \"Director Rick Friedberg [...] has crafted a dreadfully unfunny comedy that takes Naked Gun-like sketches and rehashes them without a whit of style or energy. ... For movie-after-movie, Leslie Nielsen has milked this same personality, and it's starting to wear very thin. As affable as the actor is, there's just nothing left in this caricature. However, while Spy Hard might have worked better with, say, Roger Moore in the title role (his 007 was a parody towards the end, anyway), Nielsen's performance is only a small part of a massively-flawed production. Hard is the operative word here, because, even at just eighty-one minutes, this movie is unbelievably difficult to sit through.\"[4] | Stephen Holden of New York Times wrote: \"Spy Hard is never funnier than during its opening credit sequence in which \"Weird Al\" Yankovic bellows his parody of the brassy theme song from Goldfinger, while obese cartoon silhouettes swim across the screen. ... Instead of building sustained comic set pieces, it takes a machine-gun approach to humor. Without looking at where it's aiming, it opens fire and sprays comic bullets in all directions, trusting that a few will hit the bull's-eye. A few do, but many more don't. ... Around the halfway point, Spy Hard begins to run out of ideas and becomes a series of crude, rambunctious parodies of other films. ... When Spy Hard abruptly ends after only 81 minutes, you sense that it has used up every last round of available ammunition. It was simply exhausted and couldn't move another inch.\"[5] | Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"It's done in the style of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker Naked Gun series, but although the style is there, the jokes aren't. Spy Hard relies on silly slapstick, takeoffs of recent films and the shock effect of celebrity cameos. But all that exertion doesn't add up to more than a handful of laughs. ... The story is too weak to work even as a clothesline for gags. Spy Hard eschews a coherent story and instead just strings together movie takeoffs. ... Nielsen, with his expert deadpan and sense of comic timing, creates the illusion of humor -- for about 15 minutes. Thanks to him, what could have been an unbearable experience becomes merely empty. Still, he can't work miracles, and nothing short of a miracle could have made Spy Hard worth seeing.\"[6] | The film opened at #3 with $10,448,420 behind Mission: Impossible's opening weekend and Twister's third. It eventually grossed $26,960,191 at the box office.[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Rick Friedberg","m_produced_by":"Rick Friedberg Doug Draizin Jeffrey Konvitz","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Leslie Nielsen Nicollette Sheridan Andy Griffith Charles Durning","m_music_by":"Bill Conti","m_cinematography":"John R.
