{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A high-level cartel lawyer with dirty hands, known only as \"the Counselor\", and his girlfriend Laura are talking sexily in bed. Meanwhile, somewhere in Mexico, cocaine is packaged in barrels and concealed in a sewage truck, driven across the border and stored at a sewage treatment plant. | After the Counselor goes to Amsterdam to meet with a diamond dealer to purchase an expensive engagement ring for Laura, he proposes and she accepts. He drives expensive cars and wears elegant suits. At a party thrown by Reiner and girlfriend Malkina, a former call girl with a greedy talent for money, the Counselor discusses a nightclub he and Reiner intend to run, as well as an upcoming drug deal, which would be his first. | The Counselor meets with Westray, a business associate of Reiner's. He hears of the deal's four-thousand percent return rate, but Westray warns the Counselor about becoming involved, saying that Mexican cartels are merciless. Malkina begins to gain knowledge of the deal through her access to Reiner and by conveniently overhearing various intercoms in Reiner's home. Just before this, Reiner describes an execution device called \"the bolito\" which gradually strangles and decapitates the victim. Reiner later describes how disturbed and oddly aroused he was from an incident where he witnessed Malkina perform and masturbate with his Ferrari California's[4] windshield. | The Counselor visits a client, a prison inmate named Ruth who is on trial for murder. Ruth's son is a biker and a valued cartel member known as \"the Green Hornet\" recently arrested for speeding. The Counselor agrees to bail him out of jail. | Meanwhile, Malkina, a ruthless criminal herself, begins to sense an opportunity to undermine the Counselor's upcoming deal and to gain the profit for herself. Her plan to do this is unknown to either Reiner or the Counselor. She employs \"the Wireman\" to steal the drugs. The Wireman decapitates the biker, Ruth's recently released son, with a wire stretched across the highway. After collecting the component that will allow the sewage truck to start, the Wireman steals the truck containing the cocaine. | Learning of this incident, Westray meets with the Counselor to notify him that the Green Hornet is dead and that the cocaine has been stolen, bleakly intoning the Counselor's culpability. Westray says he is leaving town immediately and suggests the Counselor do the same. Westray explains that the cartel's ruthlessness extends to creating \"snuff films\" where murder victims are filmed having necrophilia performed on them on camera. The Counselor makes an urgent call to Laura, arranging to meet her in another state, where he will explain. | The cartel has learned that the Counselor bailed out the Green Hornet, which appears as suspect timing and fully blameworthy for the punitive purposes of the cartel. In Texas, two cartel members pretending to be police officers pull over the Wireman and his accomplice. The accomplice shoots and kills one of the imposter police officers and wounds the other. The wounded cartel member manages to kill the accomplice and the Wireman, also gunning down an innocent driver who comes upon the scene. | Reiner is accidentally killed by cartel members while they are attempting to capture him. The cartel then kidnaps Laura. In a last-ditch effort, The Counselor contacts Jefe, a high-ranking cartel member, for suggestions on what to do next. Jefe darkly and mordantly advises the Counselor to resign himself to the choices he made long beforehand. | The Counselor goes to Mexico, hoping to find and rescue Laura there. A package is slipped under the door of his hotel room and in it he finds a DVD with \"Hola!\" written on it, breaking down in heavy sobs at the awareness that the disk likely contains a snuff film of Laura sent by the cartel. The next shot shows Laura's headless body being dumped into a landfill. | The cartel is unable to track Westray or Malkina. Malkina's failed effort to steal the drugs means that she is out of the money she wants. She tracks Westray to London where she hires a blonde woman to seduce him and steal his bank codes. She then hires accomplices to steal Westray's laptop, and in the process they kill him with the \"bolito\" device that Reiner had previously described to The Counselor. The film ends with Malkina meeting her banker at a restaurant, coolly explaining how she wants her profits and accounts to be handled.","m_cast":"Michael Fassbender as the Counselor, a lawyer who delves into the dark world of trafficking through his business partner Reiner. He was married previously and is now engaged to Laura. His name is never revealed. Reiner had propositioned the Counselor two years prior to get involved in the drug business, but he originally said no. | Cameron Diaz as Malkina. The name Malkina comes from Grimalkin meaning \"an evil looking female cat.\" She is a pathological liar and a sociopath, an immigrant who is now living the high-life after escaping a sordid past as an exotic dancer. Although Malkina does come from a background of little means (she never knew her parents), she is smart and calculating. She hides her psychological scars through her appearance, wearing large jewelry and extravagant clothes to draw attention to herself. Malkina has a cheetah print tattoo and owns two pet cheetahs (Raoul and Silvia). She is the girlfriend of Reiner, and together they are a powerful couple in the underground drug world. She is always aware of what is going on around her, and in control at all times. | Javier Bardem as Reiner, a charismatic entrepreneur by day and an underground drug kingpin by night. Reiner is the boyfriend of Malkina and they live an extravagant life together. His relationship with Malkina is volatile yet they are similar in nature. Reiner knows he is not the smartest of men and deep down fears this will eventually lead to his demise. He likes to live dangerously and carefree. Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper were considered for the role before Bardem was cast.[5] | Penélope Cruz as Laura, a naïve and generally positive, religious woman who values tradition. She is in a long-distance relationship with the Counselor and they soon become engaged. She senses that she may not know what the Counselor does while she is away yet does not let this get in the way of their relationship. Her failure to see the evil in those around her could cost her everything. Her real-life husband Javier Bardem also appears in the film, marking their first film together (although they do not share scenes together) since Vicky Cristina Barcelona. | Brad Pitt as Westray, a womanizing, charismatic middleman and a friend of Reiner's who meets with the Counselor to develop the deal. Westray understands the drug world better than Reiner but his vices for women and alcohol could prove to be a fatal flaw. | Rosie Perez as Ruth, a prison convict. Through court-appointment she is represented by the Counselor for murder charges. | Richard Cabral as the Young Man/the Green Hornet; Ruth's son and a dangerous, high-ranking member of the cartel with a target on his back. | Natalie Dormer as the Blonde, a young woman hired by Malkina to help her carry out her plans by seducing Westray. | Édgar Ramírez as the Priest, whom Malkina goes to speak with. | Bruno Ganz as the Diamond Dealer, who sells Laura's engagement ring to the Counselor. | Rubén Blades as Jefe, a senior member of the cartel. | Goran Višnjić as Michael, a banker friend of Malkina's she meets with to discuss her future plans. | Velibor Topic as Sedan Man | Toby Kebbell as Tony, an old client of the Counselor's. | Emma Rigby as Tony's girlfriend | John Leguizamo as Randy, a cartel member in Chicago from Colombia. | Dean Norris as the Buyer, a man who buys drugs from Randy in Chicago. | Donna Air as the Chauffeur | Fernando Cayo as Abogado Hernandez, a lawyer the Counselor goes to see for help. | Sam Spruell as Jaime \"the Wireman\", a criminal hired by Malkina. | Richard Brake as the Wireman's accomplice | Alex Hafner as the Highway Patrolman","m_reception":"Preliminary reports had The Counselor tracking for an $8.6–$13 million debut in North America.[23][24] The film opened to $3.2 million in 3,336 locations on Friday and opened at #4 in the box office with just a cumulative $7,842,930 over the weekend.[25] | The film received negative reviews, although one of the few aspects that was praised was Cameron Diaz's performance, and it was seen as one of her best performances in recent years. The film received a 35% approval rating on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 194 reviews, with an average score of 4.9 out of 10. The consensus states: \"The Counselor raises expectations with its talented cast and creative crew—then subverts them with a wordy and clumsy suspense thriller that's mercilessly short on suspense or thrills.\"[26] On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 based on 42 reviews, considered to be \"mixed or average reviews\".[27] It received a very negative grade of a \"D\" from market-research firm CinemaScore.[28] | Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, calling it \"not a very likable or gratifying film,\" adding that \"one is left with a very bleak ending and an only slightly less depressing sense of the waste of a lot of fine talent both behind and in front of the camera.\"[29] Mark Kermode listed it as number two on his Ten Worst Films of 2013.[30] The Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan stated, \"As cold, precise and soulless as the diamonds that figure briefly in its plot, The Counselor is an extremely unpleasant piece of business.\"[31] Peter Debruge of Variety criticized Cormac McCarthy's script, saying that his \"first original script is nearly all dialogue, but it's a lousy story, ineptly constructed and rendered far too difficult to follow.\"[32] | Conversely, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, saying \"director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Cormac McCarthy have fashioned a sexy, sometimes shockingly violent, literate and richly textured tale of the Shakespearean consequences of one man’s irrevocable act of avarice\" and called it \"a bloody great time.\"[33] In addition, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film a rave review, stating that \"Mr. McCarthy appears to have never read a screenwriting manual in his life [...] That's a compliment.\"[34] Danny Leigh of the BBC film review programme Film 2013 praised the film, saying that \"the real star is the script. What this film really is a Cormac McCarthy audiobook with visuals by Ridley Scott. It's black as night, engrossing and masterful.\" He also acclaimed the performances, particularly Diaz's, and said, with regard to the negative reviews, \"Movie history is littered with films that we all sneered at and we all laughed at and we all thought were terrible and the critics hated them and no-one went to see them, and then 40 years later they fetch up on programmes like this with everyone saying 'what a masterpiece!'\"[35] | Scott Foundas, chief film critic for Variety, wrote a defense of the film titled \"Why The Counselor Is One of Ridley Scott's Best Films\" in which he compared it to John Boorman's Point Blank and the screenplay to the work of David Mamet, Harold Pinter, and Quentin Tarantino. Foundas writes, \"[the film] is bold and thrilling in ways that mainstream American movies rarely are, and its rejection suggests what little appetite there is for real daring at the multiplex nowadays.\"[36]","m_production":"On January 18, 2012, it was reported that novelist Cormac McCarthy had sold his first spec script, The Counselor, to Nick Wechsler, Steve Schwartz and Paula Mae Schwartz, who had previously produced the film adaptation of McCarthy's novel The Road.[7] On January 31, it was reported that Ridley Scott was currently considering several directorial projects, but that there was a strong possibility that The Counselor would be his next film and his follow-up to Prometheus.[8] On February 9, it was confirmed that Scott would direct.[9] Scott also became a producer. Cormac McCarthy, Mark Huffam, Michael Schaefer and Michael Costigan are executive producers. | Principal photography began on July 27, 2012 in London. The film was also shot in Spain and the United States.[10] On August 20, 2012, Scott halted production of the film due to his brother Tony's death. He canceled that week's shoot in order to travel to Los Angeles to be with his brother's family.[11] Scott returned to London to resume production on September 3.[12] | The film was dedicated to the memory of Tony Scott, who had taken his own life during production, and Matt Baker, the second assistant director on the film who had since died.[13] Only the Baker dedication is seen onscreen, however. | The first teaser trailer was released June 25, 2013. | Costume designer Janty Yates collaborated with Giorgio Armani on the film as a part of a new partnership between Armani and 20th Century Fox that also extends into retail and digital initiatives.[14] Armani was enlisted to create the wardrobes for the characters portrayed by Michael Fassbender and Penélope Cruz.[15] In addition to Armani, designer Paula Thomas also contributed to the film's wardrobe by dressing Cameron Diaz's character, Malkina, with roughly 15 different outfits.[16] \"[It wasn't until] I read the script that I realized why [Scott] called upon me,\" said Thomas. \"[Cameron's] character has a lot of elements of a Thomas Wylde woman. [She's] bold, edgy, modern. She’s about wanting to be seen, as opposed to blending into the background.\"[17] | For Javier Bardem's character, Yates applied a widely colorful wardrobe that was mostly made up of pieces of Versace.[17] As for Bardem's hair, the idea was the actor's own and inspired by film producer Brian Grazer's hairdo.[18] | The film score to The Counselor was composed by Daniel Pemberton.[19] Pemberton recorded the score with a full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in addition to integrating home-recorded guitar noises and textures.[20] \"Ridley responds really well to interesting and unusual sounds,\" explained Pemberton on the composer-director relationship. \"So as a composer who likes making unusual sounds, that’s exciting. It was daunting but he was great to work with and up for experimenting. [...] He made the process a lot less scary than it should have been.\"[21] A soundtrack album was released digitally on October 22 and in physical forms on November 11, 2013 by Milan Records.[22]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Ridley Scott","m_produced_by":"Ridley Scott | Nick Wechsler | Steve Schwartz | Paula Mae Schwartz","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Fassbender | Penélope Cruz | Cameron Diaz | Javier Bardem | Brad Pitt","m_music_by":"Daniel Pemberton","m_cinematography":"Dariusz Wolski","m_edited_by":"Pietro Scalia","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"October 3, 2013 (2013-10-03) (Leicester Square) | October 25, 2013 (2013-10-25) (United States) | November 15, 2013 (2013-11-15) (United Kingdom) |  | ","m_running_time":"118 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom | United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$25 million[2]","m_box_office":"$71 million[3] | The Counselor (spelled The Counsellor in some markets) is a 2013 British-American crime thriller film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Cormac McCarthy.
