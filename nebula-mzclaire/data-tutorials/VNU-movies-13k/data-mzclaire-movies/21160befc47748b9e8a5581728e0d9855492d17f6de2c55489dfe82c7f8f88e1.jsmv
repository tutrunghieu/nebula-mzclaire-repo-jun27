{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are divorce mediators in Washington D.C. The two friends frequently \"crash\" wedding parties to meet and bed women, working from a set of rules taught to them by a retired crasher, Chazz Reinhold (an uncredited Will Ferrell). | The duo always has cover stories for inquisitive guests and inevitably become the hit of every reception by using their charm and lies to avoid being caught. Their goals are to enjoy the free food and drinks and ultimately to charm their way into bed with women from the wedding for a one-night stand. After a sequence of successful crashes, Jeremy takes John to a wedding for the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, William Cleary (Christopher Walken). Once inside, the pair set their sights on Cleary's other daughters, Gloria (Isla Fisher) and Claire (Rachel McAdams). Jeremy ends up having sex with Gloria on a nearby beach while the reception is taking place. Gloria is possessive and quickly becomes obsessed with Jeremy. She claims to have been a virgin until the encounter, which shocks Jeremy, and he urges John to bail on the reception with him. | Meanwhile, John is attempting to court Claire, the maid of honor, but he is interrupted by her hotheaded boyfriend, Sack Lodge (Bradley Cooper), who later turns out to want to date Claire only because of William's political power and is shown to openly mock and cheat on her behind her back. Later, John convinces Jeremy to accept the family's invitation to an extended weekend party at their family compound. Once there, Jeremy, John, and other members of the family play a game of touch football, which ends with Jeremy being hurt by an over-aggressive Sack. Gloria tends to him, while trying to engage him in sexual intercourse at the same time. | At dinner later that evening, Gloria gives Jeremy a hand job under the dinner table, while John spikes Sack's wine with eye-drops (as a form of revenge for his earlier behavior). Sack becomes sick, which lets John further connect with Claire, and they agree to go for a walk following dinner. John goes to his room to change his shoes, but William's wife, Kathleen (Jane Seymour), makes John fondle her surgically enhanced breasts, then rebuffs his actions, much to John's confusion. | Later that night, Gloria ties up Jeremy and proceeds to rape him, saying she is being \"adventurous\" and is fulfilling fantasies. That same night, Gloria's gay brother, Todd (Keir O'Donnell), paints a provocative portrait of Jeremy and tries to seduce him, but is interrupted by his father. The next morning, Jeremy asks John if they can go home, but John convinces him to stay, which helps Jeremy realize that John is falling for Claire. That afternoon, the family (minus Sack) go sailing, where John and Claire continue to bond. Following the sailing trip, the family (with Sack now joining them) go on a hunting trip, where Sack intentionally shoots in the direction of Jeremy and John which startles them and ends up with Jeremy being shot in the buttocks. | After the hunting trip, John and Claire go on a bike ride through the country, and they end up at a secluded beach. Claire finally admits she isn't sure how she feels about Sack and ends up kissing John passionately. Meanwhile, Gloria is tending to Jeremy's wounds and reveals to Jeremy that she was not a virgin when they met and that she only said that because that's what she thought he would like to hear. Jeremy realizes that he may be in love with Gloria. Later that day while eating lunch, Sack suspects that Claire may be falling in love with John and announces (untruthfully) that he and Claire are engaged. This leaves her at a loss for words and John is angry about this. He is convinced that Sack is lying about the whole thing just so he can keep them apart and is determined to fight for her. | Outside, John is about to convince Claire to be with him, when they are interrupted by Jeremy being chased out of the house. Sack emerges and forces John and Jeremy to tell the truth about who they really are, as he had them privately investigated. John reluctantly reveals their true identities, and William kicks them out. Claire is betrayed by this and tells John she wants him out of her life. While leaving, Todd wants his portrait back, but Jeremy tells him that he's keeping it as a gift; this gives Todd some relief knowing that someone took him seriously as an artist. Jeremy and Gloria briefly confess their love to each other. | John and Jeremy return to their normal lives. During that time, Jeremy is trying to keep his relationship with Gloria a secret when John comes in to talk to him. He has formulated a new way to try and reconcile with Claire by pretending to be a waiter at her engagement party. Fearing the worst, Jeremy tries to talk some sense into John by warning him that his past attempts were unsuccessful and he needs to let it go by accepting the fact that she doesn't want anything to do with him. John refuses to give up on the whole thing, mentioning his belief that Sack doesn't love Claire like he does and wants to continue fighting for her. He admits he had been concerned for Jeremy because he had been avoiding crashing weddings the past few weeks and wants his help. Jeremy attempts to warn John again that the engagement party will be heavily guarded by the Secret Service and they have no chance of getting inside without being caught because the SS knows who they are (from their earlier encounter with Sack and the Cleary family). He tries to convince John that their best chances to avoid being spotted is to stay away from the party itself and keep a low profile. John is determined to go through with the whole thing and tells Jeremy that he thought his plan through and he'll be fine. However, Jeremy is still skeptical about John's plan and refuses to go. | While pretending to be a waiter at the party, John watches Claire dancing with her father and is happy. Soon he is caught by an angry Sack who spots him from behind the kitchen door window and he is taken outside. Sack brutally beats up John while his friends hold him still and he warns John to stay away from Claire or he will kill him the next time he sees John. Once he recovers, John goes to search for Jeremy and plans to confront him for his non-appearance in leaving him behind to get beaten up by Sack. When he comes over to Jeremy's house to do so, John catches him having sex with Gloria. Jeremy realizes he is caught and chases after John as Gloria hurries over to Claire's engagement party. Once John learns the truth about Jeremy and Gloria's secret relationship, he's upset by the whole thing and it causes a rift between him and Jeremy. John crashes several more weddings alone, but behaves erratically due to his state of depression, and soon becomes nihilistic and suicidal. Meanwhile, Jeremy continues his relationship with Gloria, culminating in an accepted marriage proposal, and Claire begins to doubt her relationship with Sack. Jeremy attempts to reconcile with John, asking him to be his best man, but John refuses and ask him to leave his home. | John then goes to the house of their former mentor, Chazz Reinhold, to reaffirm Jeremy's apparent stupidity in getting engaged. During the visit, Chazz talks him into crashing a funeral, as Chazz believes that grief is \"nature's most powerful aphrodisiac.\" While there, John takes notice of a woman who is truly grieving for her husband because she loved him. This moment helps him see what is more important to him, reconsiders his stance on love and marriage and rushes to Jeremy's wedding. | John joins the wedding mid-ceremony to Jeremy's delight, but soon disrupts it by attempting to speak to Claire. Claire, in tears, leaves the altar, but John quickly professes his love to her and his feelings of regret of his past behavior toward women. Sack interrupts, asking Claire to return to the altar so the wedding can be finished. Claire finally tells Sack that she can't marry him. He turns to William for help, but instead William states his full support of his daughter's decision to reject Sack. Immediately, William admits his own dislike for him and shows his awareness in the negative things Sack said about her behind her back. William also admitted that he only tolerated Sack because he thought Claire was happy being with him and soon realized she was more happier with John since he accepted her for who she is. Sack angrily demands that Claire return to the altar. When John makes a crack about the anger, he loses control of himself and rushes to once again punch John, only for Jeremy to intervene and knock him out. | The film ends with Jeremy getting married to Gloria, John uniting with Claire, and the two couples driving away talking about crashing another wedding together.","m_cast":"Owen Wilson as John Beckwith, one half of the wedding crasher duo; a bachelor attorney riding high on his success with Jeremy. | Vince Vaughn as Jeremy Grey, the other half of the wedding crasher duo; an arrogant lothario.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 75%, based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Wedding Crashers is both raunchy and sweet, and features top-notch comic performances from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.\"[7] On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[citation needed] | Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote a favorable review and said \"underneath the diarrhea gags, the long lens at close range of Vaughn's pants and the handcuffs, it's really just a love story about a couple of buddies who live happily ever after. And it couldn't have happened to a nicer, more charming couple\".[8] Manohla Dargis of the New York Times said \"It's crude, yes, but also funny; too bad these lost boys can't stay lost. Like clockwork, the film soon mutates from a guy-oriented sex comedy into a wish-fulfillment chick flick\".[9] | British Movie magazine Empire awarded it three out of five stars and were complimentary to Vaughn and Wilson, saying \"Sharing an easy chemistry and free of the usual joker/straight-guy dynamic, Wilson and Vaughn quip, riff and banter to hilarious effect. And both get their fair share of money moments, the latter’s muggings are particularly hysterical in a raunchy dinner-party sequence, The laidback stars are funny and sweet, but they’re let down by a patchy script which squanders some potentially priceless set-ups.\"[10] | The film was released in North America on July 15, 2005, and became an immediate hit, grossing $33,900,720 in its first weekend,[11] hitting #2 in the box office, behind Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Fairly well received by critics, the film eventually grossed over $209,255,921 domestically, narrowly outgrossing Charlie. Considering its modest budget ($40 million) and competition with heavily advertised blockbusters during the summer season, the studio did not expect the movie's astounding level of success. It grossed $75,920,820 overseas, totaling $285,176,741 worldwide.[12] | On April 24, 2006, Wedding Crashers topped the nominations for the year's MTV Movie Awards with five including Best Movie. It won Best Movie, On-Screen Team (Vaughn and Wilson), and Breakthrough Performance (Isla Fisher).

His character from Wedding Crashers placed number two behind William Zabka's character from The Karate Kid, whom he would later play in a Saturday Night Live sketch in 2009.[13] |  | The DVD was released in the U.S. on January 3, 2006, and a Blu-ray was released on December 30, 2008.
