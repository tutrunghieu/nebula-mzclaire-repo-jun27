Film critic Susan Stark from The Detroit News stated, \"For all the pleasure there is in seeing effective, great-looking black women grappling with major life issues on screen, Waiting to Exhale is an uneven piece.\"[6] Reviewer Liam Lacey from The Daily Globe and Mail said of the film, \"[It] never escapes the queasy aura of Melrose Place: just another story about naive people with small problems.\"[7] However, film critic Roger Ebert positively reviewed the film, stating that it is \"an escapist fantasy that women in the audience can enjoy by musing, 'I wish I had her problems'—and her car, house, wardrobe, figure and men, even wrong men.\"[8] The film received a 52% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews.[7] | In the book Is Marriage for White People? writer and Stanford Law School professor Ralph Richard Banks states that the film is a perfect example of the problems African-American women have in finding serious relationships.[9]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"Interviewed in the spring of 2011 on an episode of The Talk, Angela Bassett confirmed that a sequel was in the planning stages, with all the female principals signed on to star, and Whitaker returning to direct.
