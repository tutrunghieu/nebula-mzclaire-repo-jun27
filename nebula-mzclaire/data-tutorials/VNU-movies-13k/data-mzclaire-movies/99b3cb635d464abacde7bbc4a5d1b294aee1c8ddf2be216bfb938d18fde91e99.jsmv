{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Tony (T.C. Stallings) and Elizabeth Jordan (Priscilla Shirer) have a big house, a beautiful daughter, and plenty of money. Despite their apparent success, they face a strained marriage. Tony, a pharmaceutical salesman, is almost never there for his daughter, Danielle (Alena Pitts); has been verbally abusive with Elizabeth; and has thoughts about cheating on his wife with other women he has been looking at. | Elizabeth, a realtor, goes to work with the elderly Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie) to sell her house. Miss Clara senses the stress Elizabeth is under, and suggests that Elizabeth fight for their marriage by praying for Tony. Miss Clara shows Elizabeth a special closet she has dedicated to praying, and calls it her \"War Room\" because as she puts it, \"In order to stand up and fight the enemy, you need to get on your knees and pray.\" As Elizabeth starts to seriously pray for her husband, Tony is away on a business trip but is having dinner with a beautiful woman who invites him back to her apartment. Just as he is about to leave with her, he becomes nauseous and runs to the bathroom to throw up. | Shortly afterward, Tony is fired for inflating his sales figures. Realizing he has hit rock bottom, he rededicates his life to God. Unknown to Elizabeth and Danielle, he has been keeping several samples for himself. He now realizes that he has to return them, even though it could potentially send him to prison. Tony's former boss is moved by his willingness to admit his wrongdoing and make amends, and decides not to press charges. Tony begins to show an interest in his daughter's jump roping skills and offers to participate with her and her friends in the upcoming double Dutch competition at the local community center. Tony's team takes second place in the competition creating a new bond between him and his daughter. Elizabeth successfully sells Miss Clara's house to a retired pastor who notices the knee indentations in the closet floor and realizes someone has been praying in the closet. Shortly afterwards, Tony is offered a job as the director of the community center. Although the pay isn't nearly what he was making as a pharmaceutical salesman, he realizes that with the income from this new job combined with Elizabeth picking up extra work, the family can make a budget and survive. | The film ends with Tony giving Elizabeth her favorite dessert while he gives her a foot massage, something she loves, and Miss Clara, now living with her son, praying a powerful prayer in the still of the night","m_cast":"Priscilla Shirer as Elizabeth Jordan | T.C.

In part the brothers left because they felt that the movie-making was distracting from other parts of the church's ministry, with Alex telling the Hollywood Reporter that they felt \"We were the elephant in the room.\"[14] Instead the brothers produced the film through the company FaithStep Films and released through Sony pictures[14] The brothers got their inspiration from prayer, with Alex stating that he believes even the idea of a war room was given to them by God.[15] | Principal photography took place over a three-month period in summer 2014 in several North Carolina locations including Charlotte, Kannapolis, Concord, Hickory, and Birkdale Village in Huntersville.[16][17] At Oakwood Cemetery in Concord, two different scenes set 40 years apart were filmed. Through special effects, the Charlotte skyline, larger trees and some additional headstones were added.[18] | Initial plans had the main characters being white; however, Alex began having dreams about a predominantly African-American cast and, believing that God was trying to tell him something, the brothers switched the characters to make it more in line with Alex's dream.[15] Early on, Sony expressed some concerns over a film with a mostly African-American cast produced by a white-led production company, but the brothers stuck to the premise.[14] | Several characters in the film are African-American and being released only months after the Charleston church shooting, those involved with the film claim to believe that the timing of release is no coincidence. According to director Kendrick, when Affirm Films first saw the film, they claimed, \"If this had been told with a different race, it would be a different movie.\"[19] | Stallings, who plays a major role in the film, says, \"There are many people out there—white and black—who stay with their families and work through their problems. They aren’t thugs or gang leaders. ’War Room’ tells the truth about society by showing the reverse of that stereotype. Racial tension is dangerous and people are dying and a lot of us want to see that stopped. We protest and speak out and tweet out, but this problem is much bigger than human beings. This movie will give people a way to take these problems to the Lord and show them that prayer is the best weapon to fight back.\"[19]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Alex Kendrick","m_produced_by":"Stephen Kendrick | Gary Wheeler","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Priscilla Shirer | T.C.
