{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"By 1994, time travel has been discovered and used for illicit purposes. The U.S. government creates the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) to police the use of time travel. Senator Aaron McComb offers to oversee the commission. Police officer Max Walker is offered a position in TEC which he takes. When he returns home that evening to tell his wife Melissa the news, he is attacked by unknown assailants and thrown out of his house. He recovers just as his house explodes, killing Melissa. | Ten years later, Walker remains a TEC agent. TEC's supervisor, Commissioner Eugene Matuzak, orders him to stop his former partner Atwood from making money illegally on the U.S. stock market crash in 1929. In the past, when Walker arrests him, Atwood admits he was doing this for McComb, who is seeking funds for his upcoming presidential run. Atwood, fearing that McComb will kill his ancestors and erase him from history, attempts to jump to his death, but Walker catches him and returns with him to 2004. Atwood refuses to testify, and they are forced to return him to 1929 in his mid-leap, and Atwood dies from the impact. | Matuzak assigns Walker a new partner, Sarah Fielding, and told to investigate McComb in 1994. There, they find McComb ready to sell off his share of a computer chip company to his partner Parker. Suddenly, McComb from the future arrives. Warning his younger self not to touch him, the older McComb tells his younger self to keep his shares as the company will be highly profitable. Parker, shaken by the two McCombs, panics, leading the older McComb to shoot and kill him. In the chaos, Fielding reveals she is a double agent working for McComb. A fight breaks out, with the older McComb wounding Fielding and barely missing Walker; the older McComb disappears to the future. Walker escapes and returns to 2004, finding that the future has drastically changed: buoyed by sole ownership of the chip company, McComb has financially secured his presidency, and the TEC division is about to be closed down due to budget constraints. Walker explains the situation to Matuzak, who is unaware of the change but agrees to help. They hijack the prototype time machine, which they learn McComb had been using. Matuzak stays behind and sacrifices himself to man the controls to send Walker back in time moments before McComb's guards kill him. | Back in 1994, Walker attempts to interrogate Fielding who is a patient in a hospital. While there, he finds documents on Melissa's recent visit, learning she is pregnant. He realizes that this will be the night she dies. When Walker returns to Fielding, she has been murdered by a lethal injection. With no other leads, he tracks down Melissa, convinces her he is from the future, and warns her about the upcoming night. | When the younger Walker returns home, he again is attacked, but his attackers, men in McComb's employ, are defeated by the older Walker who had been waiting in ambush. The older McComb appears and takes Melissa hostage while setting up a time bomb intending to separate every part of Walker from every other part of him forever. He explains that because of Walker's interference in the future, he decided to get rid of the younger version of Walker; even though he will die from the bomb his younger self will still take the presidency in time with Walker gone. The older Walker reveals he planned this, having lured the younger version of McComb to the house. Walker throws the younger McComb at the older one, who fires off a shot and wounds Melissa. The two McCombs suddenly fuse turning into a withering mass before disappearing. Walker escapes the house with Melissa before the bomb goes off, and sets her body next to his younger self. He then returns to the future. | Walker finds the timeline has been changed, this time for the better. The TEC still exists, Fielding and Matuzak are alive, and McComb does not exist, having \"vanished\" ten years earlier. As Walker returns home, he is happily shocked to find Melissa alive and their 9-year-old son waiting to greet him. Melissa has something to announce to Walker.","m_cast":"Jean-Claude Van Damme as Max Walker | Mia Sara as Melissa Walker | Ron Silver as Sen. Aaron McComb | Bruce McGill as Com.

I was approached to do Timecop, and I loved the auspices. (Producer) Larry Gordon was involved with it; Moshe Diamant was a terrific producer; Sam Raimi was involved... It was a really clever story, and I thought it was a chance to make the best movie Van Damme ever made. I said yes and we made it, and it was clear that it was going to be a hit because it previewed through the roof every time. It’s still his biggest hit. So Universal and Moshe Diamant wanted to team us again as soon as possible, so they put Sudden Death together. There was never any question that we would just do Timecop 2.
