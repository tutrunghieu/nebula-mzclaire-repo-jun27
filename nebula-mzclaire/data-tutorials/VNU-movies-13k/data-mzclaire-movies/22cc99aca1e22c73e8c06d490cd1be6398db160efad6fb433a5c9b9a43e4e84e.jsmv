{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Shortly after the death of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) travels to a secluded beach to surf, which is also the same beach her mother surfed at after finding out she was pregnant with Nancy many years before. Nancy gets a ride to the beach from Carlos (Óscar Jaenada), a friendly local resident, who refuses to tell her the beach's name, saying only that it is paradise. After arriving at the beach, Nancy joins two other local residents, and the three surf for several hours. | Taking a break from surfing, Nancy video-chats her sister Chloe (Sedona Legge) to let her know that she is surfing at their mother's beach. When she talks to her father (Brett Cullen), it is revealed that her mother's death has caused Nancy to consider dropping out of medical school. The conversation becomes emotional and strained, and Nancy hangs up to catch one more wave in the late afternoon before heading back to her hotel. While waiting for a wave, Nancy notices a large whale carcass floating about twenty yards away. While riding a wave back to the beach, a large great white shark bumps her surf board, causing her to fall and hit her head on a submerged rock formation. As she surfaces to her board, the shark bites her leg, pulling her under. Nancy crawls onto the whale carcass where she stays until the shark rams it from underneath. Nancy swims to an isolated reef, where she places a tourniquet on her leg to stop the bleeding. The two locals depart, leaving Nancy to spend the night on the reef. | The next morning, Nancy sees a drunk local man passed out on the beach. She gets his attention, but he proceeds to steal her phone, money, and backpack. After noticing her surfboard floating in shallow water, he wades out to retrieve it, only to be torn in half by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water before Nancy can warn them away, and both are killed by the shark. Nancy retrieves one of the men's GoPro camera helmet, and records a message for her father and sister, and then throws the helmet toward the shore. | After timing the shark's circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby buoy, narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of jellyfish, which sting both the shark and Nancy. Nancy is able to find a flare gun on the buoy, but cannot catch the attention of a passing cargo ship farther out to sea. Nancy shoots at the shark, which catches on fire because of all the whale blubber in the water. The shark begins furiously attacking the buoy, ripping out one of the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy grabs onto the remaining chain. When it also breaks, she lets it pull her down to the ocean floor. The shark pursues Nancy down as fast as possible and is killed when it impales itself on the metal rods of the buoy's mooring. | The GoPro camera is found floating near the shore by Carlos' son who brings his father to the beach. Carlos then finds Nancy floating in the shallows as his son runs for help. | One year later, Nancy and Chloe are going surfing in Galveston, Texas as her father tells her that her mother would have been proud.","m_cast":"Blake Lively[4] as Nancy Adams | Óscar Jaenada[5] as Carlos | Brett Cullen as Nancy's Father | Sedona Legge as Chloe Adams | Sully the Seagull[6] as Steven the Seagull","m_reception":"The Shallows opened on June 24, 2016 alongside Independence Day: Resurgence and Free State of Jones, and was projected to gross around $7 million from 2,800 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $11–12 million.[15] The film grossed $1.3 million from Thursday night previews[16] and $6.8 million on its first day.[17] In its opening weekend the film grossed $16.7 million, finishing 4th at the box office behind Finding Dory ($73.2 million), Independence Day: Resurgence ($41.6 million) and Central Intelligence ($18.4 million). This was near double the expectations of the studio, with Josh Greenstein, Sony president of worldwide marketing and distribution, saying, “We had the best reviewed new movie of the weekend and combined with a great audience response saw a fantastic result. People wanted to watch a film with quality that was original in this summer landscape.”[18] | The Shallows has received generally positive reviews from critics, with Blake Lively's performance being critically praised.[3] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 75%, based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Lean and solidly crafted, The Shallows transcends tired shark-attack tropes with nasty thrills and a powerful performance from Blake Lively.\"[19] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[20] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[21] | Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times, enjoyed the film, calling it an \"immensely entertaining millennial B-Movie, made for summertime viewing.\"[22] Simon Thompson of IGN gave the film a 9/10, noting, \"The Shallows does for surfing what The Blair Witch Project did for camping and makes Jaws look like a children’s tea party... Terrifyingly good.\"[23] Matt Zoller Seitz of Rogerebert.com gave the film three stars, commending the performance of Blake Lively while adding \"Lively is superb here, giving one of those hyper-focused, action-lead performances that's as much an athletic feat as an aesthetic one.\"[24] Steve Pulaski of The Baconation gave the film a positive review saying, \"The Shallows doesn't bring anything unique or amazingly new, but it works and functions on the level of making the audience uneasy and unsettled, which is about all you can ask and demand from an early-summer thriller that combines beautiful locational cinematography with overarching, almost unceasing, suspense and intrigue.\"[25] | Staci Layne Wilson of Dread Central gave the film a negative review, saying although she wanted to like it, she felt that with \"Jaume Collet-Serra’s sledgehammer-style direction, Anthony Jaswinski’s intelligence-insulting screenplay, and Marco Beltrami’s misguided musical score, The Shallows is impossible to endorse.\"[26] The A.V. Club's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, while finding the film intermittently entertaining, considered it a step down from director Collet-Serra's previous \"gimmicky genre piece\" Non-Stop as well as lacking a genuine, sustained sense of suspense. He also took issue with the writing, stating: \"Anthony Jaswinski’s screenplay bogs down this no-brainer survival premise (“get off the rock and don’t die”) with needless backstory and inchoate themes. Can’t a heroine just survive a vicious shark attack without also having to overcome a family trauma and make a decision about whether or not she wants to be a doctor?\"[27]","m_production":"Initially Louis Leterrier was to direct, although he dropped out in June 2015,[7][8] leading to Jaume Collet-Serra being considered for the job.[9] Blake Lively joined the cast in August 2015.[4] That same month the film's title was changed from In The Deep to The Shallows,[10] and it was announced that filming would begin in November in Gold Coast, Queensland Australia.[10] | Principal photography on the film began on October 28, 2015 in New South Wales, Australia.[10][11] Filming also took place at Lord Howe Island.[12][13]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Jaume Collet-Serra","m_produced_by":"Lynn Harris | Matti Leshem","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Blake Lively","m_music_by":"Marco Beltrami","m_cinematography":"Flavio Labiano","m_edited_by":"Joel Negron","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"June 21, 2016 (2016-06-21) (New York City) | June 24, 2016 (2016-06-24) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"86 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$17 million[2]","m_box_office":"$35.3 million[2] | The Shallows is a 2016 American survival horror thriller film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, written by Anthony Jaswinski and starring Blake Lively.
