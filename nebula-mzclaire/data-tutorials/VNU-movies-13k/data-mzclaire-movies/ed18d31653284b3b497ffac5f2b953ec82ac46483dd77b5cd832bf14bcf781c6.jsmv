{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The radio telescope at Parkes (Parkes Observatory), New South Wales, Australia, was used by NASA throughout the Apollo program to receive signals in the Southern Hemisphere, along with the NASA Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra. | In the days before the July 1969 space mission that marked mankind's first steps on the Moon, NASA was working with a group of Australian technicians who had agreed to rig up a satellite interface. That the Aussies placed the satellite dish smack bang in the middle of an Australian sheep farm in the regional town of Parkes was just one of the reasons that NASA was concerned. Based on a true story, The Dish takes a comical look at the differing cultural attitudes between Australia and the U.S. while revisiting one of the greatest events in history.","m_cast":"Sam Neill as Cliff Buxton | Patrick Warburton as Al Burnett | Tom Long as Glenn Latham | Kevin Harrington as Ross \"Mitch\" Mitchell | Roy Billing as Bob McIntyre | Eliza Szonert as Janine Kellerman | Tayler Kane as Rudi Kellerman | Billy Mitchell as Cameron | Roz Hammond as Miss Nolan | Christopher-Robin Street as Damien | Luke Keltie as Graeme | Naomi Wright as Melanie | Ben Wright-Smith as Nicholas | Beverley Dunn as Secretary v/o | Grant Thompson as Mr. Callen | Bille Brown as Prime Minister John Gorton | Lenka Kripac as Marie McIntyre | Neil Pigot as the newspaper reporter | Frank Bennett as Barry Steele","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Although based on true events, the film uses fictional characters and alters historical details for dramatic effect. NASA's Honeysuckle Creek and Goldstone stations both had the signal first, but Parkes' signal was used soon after the beginning of the moonwalk. No power failure occurred, there was no friction with the NASA representatives (of whom there were several, not just one), and Prime Minister John Gorton visited Honeysuckle Creek, not Parkes. They did, however, operate in very high winds (110 km/h) at 60 degrees inclination, risking damage to the dish and even injury to themselves to keep the antenna pointed at the Moon during the moonwalk.[1] | Much of the film was shot on location; the \"cricket match\" and \"hayride\" scenes were shot on the real dish and researchers often postponed experiments to position the dish for photography.[2] The set reconstructing the 1969 control room was extremely accurate, down to some details as small as ashtrays. Some of the \"props\" were in fact original NASA equipment used during the Apollo 11 landing, left behind in Australia as they were too heavy (i.e. too expensive) to ship back to the U.S.[2] Staff from that era expressed amazement at seeing the set; they said it was like stepping through a time warp.[2] | The Dish was written by Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy and Rob Sitch and directed by Sitch. | Apart from the radio telescope scenes, the majority of the movie was actually filmed in the small town of Forbes 33 km south of Parkes because of its old historic buildings, and also in Old Parliament House in Canberra, and Crawford Studios in Melbourne.[citation needed]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Rob Sitch","m_produced_by":"Santo Cilauro Tom Gleisner Michael Hirsh Jane Kennedy Rob Sitch","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sam Neill Kevin Harrington Tom Long Patrick Warburton","m_music_by":"Edmund Choi","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":"Jill Bilcock","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Roadshow Entertainment (AUS) Warner Bros.
