{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Frank Beardsley is a Navy warrant officer, recently detached from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and assigned as project officer for the Fresnel lens glide-slope indicator, or \"meatball,\" that would eventually become standard equipment on all carriers. Helen North is a nurse working in the dispensary at the California U. S. Navy base to which Frank is assigned. | Frank meets Helen, first by chance in the commissary on the Navy base and again when Frank brings his distraught teen-age daughter for treatment at the dispensary, where Helen informs him that the young lady is simply growing up in a too-crowded house that lacks a mother's guidance. They immediately hit it off and go on a date, all the while shying away from admitting their respective secrets: Frank has ten children and Helen has eight, from previous marriages ended by their spouses' deaths. | When each finally learns the other's secret, they initially resist their mutual attraction. But Chief Warrant Officer Darrell Harrison (Van Johnson) is determined to bring them together, so he \"fixes up\" each of them with a sure-to-be-incompatible blind date. Helen's date is an obstetrician (Sidney Miller) who stands a good head shorter than she (\"Darrell had a malicious sense of humor,\" Helen observes in voice-over); Frank's date is a \"hip\" girl (Louise Troy) who is not only young enough to be his daughter, but is also far too forward for his taste. As the final touch, Harrison makes sure that both dates take place in the same Japanese restaurant. As Harrison fully expects, Frank and Helen end up leaving the restaurant together in his car, with Frank's date sitting uncomfortably between them as they carry on about their children. | Frank and Helen continue to date regularly, and eventually he invites her to dinner in his home. This nearly turns disastrous when Mike, Rusty, and Greg (Tim Matheson, Gil Rogers, and Gary Goetzman), Frank's three sons, mix hefty doses of gin, scotch, and vodka into Helen's drink. As a result Helen's behavior turns wild and embarrassing, which Frank cannot comprehend until he catches his sons trying to conceal their laughter. \"The court of inquiry is now in session!\" he declares, and gets the three to own up and apologize. After this, he announces his intention to marry Helen, adding, \"And nobody put anything into my drink.\" | Most of the children fight the union at first, regarding each other and their respective stepparents with suspicion. Eventually, however, the 18 children bond into one large blended family, about to increase—Helen becomes pregnant. | Further tension develops between young Philip North and his teacher at the parochial school that he attends: his teacher insists that he use his \"legal\" name, which remains North even after his mother marries Beardsley. This prompts Helen and Frank to discuss cross-adopting each other's children, who (except for Philip) are aghast at the notion of \"reburying\" their deceased biological parents. The subsequent birth of Joseph John Beardsley finally unites the children, who agree unanimously to adoption under a common surname. | The film ends with the eldest sibling, Mike Beardsley, going off to Camp Pendleton to begin his stint in the United States Marine Corps.","m_cast":"Lucille Ball as Helen Brandmeier North Beardsley | Henry Fonda as CWO Frank Beardsley, USN | Van Johnson as CWO Darrell Harrison, USN | Walter Brooke as Howard Beardsley (Frank's brother, who in this film temporarily \"borrows\" Germaine and Joan Beardsley after Frank's detachment from the Enterprise.) | Nancy Howard as Nancy Beardsley (Frank's sister-in-law) | Sidney Miller as Dr. Ashford (Helen's date, an obstetrician who stands a good head shorter than she) | Louise Troy as Madeleine Love (Frank's date, a \"hip\" girl young enough to be his daughter) | Tom Bosley as a family doctor who makes a house call on the Beardsleys, and is also the consulting physician for the California Draft Board when Mike Beardsley reports for a required physical exam. | Mary Gregory as Sister Mary Alice, who questions Philip's use of the Beardsley name | Harry Holcombe as the judge who handles the grand mutual adoption | Ysabel MacCloskey as Number One, who lasts less than a day. | Pauline Hague as Number Two, aka \"Mrs. Anderson.\" She lasts a week because she is hiding from the police.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and praised the performances of Ball and Fonda.[6] | It was a massive commercial success, earning nearly $26 million at the box office (on a tight budget of $2.5 million) and earning over $11 million in rentals.[7] Thus, it was the top-grossing film released by United Artists in 1968 and the 11th highest grossing film of the year. (Both figures are for U.S. and Canada only.) This came about probably on the strength of Lucille Ball's name and performance (which many of her fans regard as a classic).[citation needed] | Frank Beardsley commented that his family enjoyed the film as general entertainment, and acknowledged that perhaps the scriptwriters felt that their screenplay was \"a better story\" than the truth.[8] | Unhappily, Lucille Ball failed to make appropriate tax shelter provisions for such a large profit, and thus saw most of her share going to pay taxes. | The film's success partly inspired network approval of the television series The Brady Bunch; the original script for the series pilot was written well before this movie became a reality. | Among the child actors cast as the Beardsley and North children, several went on to greater success, including Tim Matheson (billed here as Tim Matthieson) who went on to play the character Otter in the more adult-oriented comedy Animal House; Morgan Brittany (billed here as Suzanne Cupito) appeared in many episodes of Dallas; Mitch Vogel appeared in The Reivers with Steve McQueen for which Vogel received a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1970; and Tracy Nelson, daughter of actor/musician Ricky Nelson, who eventually starred in the series Father Dowling Mysteries beside Tom Bosley, who portrayed the doctor in this movie. Also, Matheson (Mike Beardsley) and future soap-opera actress Jennifer Leak (Colleen North) married in real life in 1968, although they divorced in 1971.","m_production":"Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball take turns providing voice-over narration throughout—and in at least one scene, Van Johnson talks directly to the camera, as does Fonda. | That Lucille Ball would portray Helen Beardsley was never in doubt. But a long line of distinguished actors came under consideration, at one time or another, for the role of Frank Beardsley. They included Desi Arnaz, James Stewart, Fred MacMurray, Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, and John Wayne. Henry Fonda finally accepted, and indeed asked for, the role in a telephone conversation with Robert F. Blumofe in 1967. Ball, who had worked with Fonda before in the 1942 release The Big Street, readily agreed to the casting.[4] | One account[which?] says that Ball recalled in 1961 that Desilu Productions first bought the rights to the Beardsley-North story in 1959, even before Helen Beardsley published her biography, but this is highly unlikely because Frank and Helen Beardsley married on September 6, 1961. More likely is the story that Bob Carroll and his wife brought the story of the Beardsley family to Ball's attention after reading it in a local newspaper.[5] However, Mr. Carroll is said to recall his wife mentioning the story in 1960—again, a full year before the Beardsleys were married and probably when Dick North was still alive. In any event, Desilu Productions did secure the rights early on, and Mr. Carroll and Madelyn Pugh began instantly to write a script. | Production suffered multiple interruptions for several reasons. It began in December 1962 after Ball's abortive attempt at a career on the Broadway stage. In 1963, production was halted after the box-office failure of her comedy effort Critic's Choice (with Bob Hope). Later, she had a falling-out with Madelyn Pugh (then known as Madelyn Pugh Martin) and Bob Carroll, precisely because their script overly resembled an I Love Lucy television episode, and commissioned another writer (Leonard Spigelgass) to rewrite the script.[citation needed] Mr. Spigelgass does not seem to have succeeded in breaking free of Lucy's television work, so producer Robert Blumofe hired yet two more writers (Mickey Rudin and Bernie Weitzman) to make an attempt.[citation needed] When this failed, Blumofe hired Melville Shavelson, who eventually directed. All further rewrite efforts came to an abrupt end at the insistence of United Artists, the film's eventual distributor.[citation needed] | At this point in the production cycle, Helen Beardsley's book Who Gets the Drumstick? was actually released in 1965. Like many film adaptations, exactly how much the book informed the final shooting script is impossible to determine, although the book did receive a \"based on\" credit in the opening titles. | Production began in 1967 with Henry Fonda definitely signed on to portray Frank. Mort Lachman, who had been one of Bob Hope's writers, joined the writing team at the recommendation of Shavelson.[citation needed] Leonard Spigelgass received no on-screen writing credit for his efforts in this film. | Filming was done largely on-location in Alameda and San Francisco, California with Mike's high-school graduation being filmed at Grant High School in southern California (Frank Beardsley's home, into which the blended family eventually moved, was in Carmel). The total budget is estimated at $2,500,000 US, including $1,700,000 for actual filming and post-production.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Melville Shavelson","m_produced_by":"Robert F.

Screenwriters Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll wrote several I Love Lucy-style stunts that in most cases had no basis in the actual lives of the Beardsley family, before Melville Shavelson and Mort Lachman took over primary writing duties.
