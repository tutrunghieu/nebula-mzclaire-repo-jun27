{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Dr. Andrew Manson (Robert Donat) is an idealistic newly qualified Scottish doctor dedicated to treating the Welsh miners suffering from tuberculosis in the Welsh mining village of Blaenely and is an apprentice to Dr. Page (Basil Gill). Initially, he has many lofty scientific goals, but his purpose erodes when he later moves to London to treat rich hypochondriacs. There, chance encounter with a medical school friend Dr. Frederick Lawford (Rex Harrison) leads to his quiet seduction by an unethical medical establishment. Christine (Rosalind Russell), his wife tries to set him back on the original path. Dr. Philip Denny (Ralph Richardson), Manson's best friend, dies at the hands of an incompetent, social-climbing surgeon. | The film is based on the novel, but departs from it in certain vital respects. In the original text the character of Christine Manson is killed off in a road accident at the point when she and her husband have begun to address problems in their relationship. The incident involving the incompetent surgeon occurs, but it is a minor character who dies. Denny survives, and the understanding (not related in the book but implied) is that he and Manson went into practice together.[1] The 1982 BBC adaptation of the novel stays closer to the original text.","m_cast":"Robert Donat as Dr. Andrew Manson | Rosalind Russell as Christine Barlow | Ralph Richardson as Dr. Philip Denny | Rex Harrison as Dr. Frederick Lawford | Emlyn Williams as Mr. Owen | Penelope Dudley Ward as Toppy LeRoy | Francis L.
