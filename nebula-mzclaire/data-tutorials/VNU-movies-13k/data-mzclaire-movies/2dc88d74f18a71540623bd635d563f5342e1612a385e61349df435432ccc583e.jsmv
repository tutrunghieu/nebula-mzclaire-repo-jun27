{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set over Thanksgiving weekend, 1973, the film centers around Ben and Elena Hood, and their children, 16-year-old Paul and 14-year-old Wendy, and their neighbors, Jim and Janey Carver, and their children: Mikey and Sandy. | Ben, dissatisfied in his marriage and with the futility of his career, is having an affair with Janey. Elena is bored with her life and is looking to expand her thinking but is unsure of how to do so. Wendy enjoys sexual games with her school peers. | Wendy decides to make her way to the Carvers' to see Mikey, but he has decided to go out into the ice storm, so she and Sandy climb into bed together and remove their clothes. They drink from a bottle of vodka and Wendy tries to seduce him; however, they both fall asleep. | Ben, Elena and the Carvers attend a \"key party\" where married couples swap sexual partners by having wives select other husbands' keys from a bowl. As the party progresses, Ben becomes drunk. When Janey chooses the keys of a handsome young man, Ben attempts to protest but trips and knocks his head on the coffee table, leading Jim to realize that his wife and Ben are having an affair. Ben, in his embarrassment, retreats to the bathroom where he remains for the rest of the evening. The remaining key party participants are paired off and leave together with only Jim and Elena remaining. She retrieves Jim's keys from the bowl and returns them to him. After debating the issue, Jim and Elena leave together, engaging in a quick, clumsy sexual encounter in the front seat of Jim's car. Jim, regretting the line he and Elena have just crossed, agrees to drive her home. | Meanwhile, Mikey, out walking in the storm, is enchanted by the beauty of the trees and fields covered in ice. He slides down an icy hill then sits on a guardrail to rest. A moment later a power line, broken by a fallen tree, connects with the guardrail and he is electrocuted. | Jim and Elena return to the Carvers' house as dawn is breaking. Elena walks in on her daughter in bed with Sandy and orders her to get dressed. | Janey had also returned home earlier and curled up on her bed in the fetal position without bothering to take off her party clothes. Although it is not revealed what transpired between Janey and her 'key partner', she is visibly exhausted and sad. | Ben has sobered up by this time and begins driving home. He discovers Mikey's body on the side of the road and carries it back to the Carvers' house. The two families are drawn together by Mikey's death and Wendy hugs the shocked and numbed Sandy in an attempt to comfort him. Jim is devastated while Janey remains asleep and ignorant to the recent events. Ben, Elena and Wendy then drive to the train station to pick up Paul, who is returning from his friend Libbets' apartment, his train delayed by the ice and the power failure caused by the downed wire. Once all four are together in the car, Ben breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably at the wheel as Elena starts comforting him.","m_cast":"Kevin Kline as Ben Hood | Joan Allen as Elena Hood | Sigourney Weaver as Janey Carver | Henry Czerny as George Clair | Tobey Maguire as Paul Hood | Christina Ricci as Wendy Hood | Elijah Wood as Mikey Carver | Adam Hann-Byrd as Sandy Carver | David Krumholtz as Francis Davenport | Jamey Sheridan as Jim Carver | Kate Burton as Dorothy Franklin | Michael Cumpsty as Reverend Philip Edwards | Katie Holmes as Libbets Casey | Glenn Fitzgerald as Neil Conrad | Allison Janney as Dot Halford | Jonathan Freeman as Ted Franklin | Barbara Garrick as Weather reporter | John Benjamin Hickey as Mark Boland | Joe O'Connor as Marty","m_reception":"Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film Two Thumbs Up, with Gene Siskel calling it the best film of the year, and Roger Ebert calling it Ang Lee's best film yet. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 84% based on reviews from 61 critics.[5] | The film was entered into the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, where James Schamus won the award for Best Screenplay.[6] | The film's release was limited, and it grossed US$7.8 million against a production budget of US$18 million.[7] | For her performance, Sigourney Weaver received the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress and was also nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe.","m_production":"The Ice Storm was first brought to the attention of producer James Schamus by his wife, literary scout Nancy Kricorian, who knew Rick Moody from Columbia University's MFA program. Schamus has said, \"It's an astonishingly cinematic book... But, because of its truly literary qualities, people may have missed its extraordinary cinematic possibilities.\"[3] Philosopher Slavoj Žižek has stated that Schamus was also inspired by one of Žižek’s books[which?] at the time of writing the screenplay: \"When James Schamus was writing the scenario, he told me that he was reading a book of mine and that my theoretical book was inspiration.\"[4] | Schamus brought the book to filmmaker Ang Lee, who was the first and only contender to turn the book into a film, and with whom Schamus and partner Ted Hope had already made four films, including The Wedding Banquet in 1993. Despite the obvious appeal of Moody's comedy of familial errors, Lee stated that what attracted him to the book was its climax: the scene where Ben Hood makes a shocking discovery in the ice, followed by the emotional reunion of the Hood family on the morning after the storm. \"The book moved me at those two points\", says Lee. \"I knew there was a movie there.\"[3] | To prepare for the film, Lee let the cast members study stacks of magazine cutouts from the early 1970s. Moody was reportedly very pleased with the final version – and reportedly \"sobbed\" during the end credits.[citation needed] He also expressed his happiness that the success of the film brought more attention to his novel, leading to more book sales.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Ice Storm  by Rick Moody","m_directed_by":"Ang Lee","m_produced_by":"Ted Hope James Schamus Ang Lee","m_screenplay_by":"James Schamus","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Kevin Kline Joan Allen Henry Czerny Adam Hann-Byrd Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Jamey Sheridan Elijah Wood Katie Holmes Sigourney Weaver","m_music_by":"Mychael Danna","m_cinematography":"Frederick Elmes","m_edited_by":"Tim Squyres","m_production_company":"Good Machine","m_distributed_by":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","m_release_dates":"May 12, 1997 (1997-05-12) (Cannes) | September 26, 1997 (1997-09-26) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"113 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$18 million","m_box_office":"$8,038,061 | The Ice Storm is a 1997 American drama film directed by Ang Lee, based on the 1994 novel of the same name by Rick Moody. | The film features an ensemble cast of Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Katie Holmes, Glenn Fitzgerald, Jamey Sheridan, and Sigourney Weaver.
