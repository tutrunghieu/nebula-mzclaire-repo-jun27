{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Newlyweds Peter and Joan Alison, on their honeymoon in Hungary, learn that due to a mixup, they must share a train compartment with Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Béla Lugosi), a Hungarian psychiatrist. Eighteen years before, Werdegast went to war, never seeing his wife again. He has spent the last 15 years in an infamous prison camp in Siberia. On the train, the doctor explains that he is traveling to see an old friend, Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff), an Austrian architect. | Later, the doctor, Peter, and Joan, share a bus, which crashes on a desolate, rain-swept road. Joan is injured, and the doctor and Peter take her to Poelzig's home, built upon the ruins of Fort Marmorus, which Poelzig commanded during the war. Werdegast treats Joan's injury, administering the tranquilizing drug hyoscine, causing the woman to behave erratically. While Peter puts her to bed, Werdegast accuses Poelzig of betraying the fort during the war to the Russians, resulting in the death of thousands of Austro-Hungarian soldiers. He also accuses Poelzig of stealing his wife Karen while he was in prison. Early on in the movie, Werdegast kills Poelzig's black cat, but Poelzig, who keeps dead women on display in glass cases, carries a second black cat around the house with him while he oversees other preserved dead women. | Poelzig plans to sacrifice Joan Alison in a satanic ritual during the dark of the moon. He is seen reading a book called The Rites of Lucifer, while a beautiful blonde woman sleeps next to him. The blonde is Werdegast's daughter - thus, Poelzig's stepdaughter, also named Karen; one of the women in the glass cases is Werdegast's wife. Werdegast bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike down the mad architect who used to be his friend. | That moment comes during the beginning of the satanists' service, when a female acolyte sees something which causes her to scream and faint. Werdegast and Thamal snatch Joan from the sacrificial alter and carry her into the catacombs beneath the house, where Peter is rendered unconscious by Poelzig's majordomo. Poelzig, meanwhile, is captured by Werdegast and shackled to an embalming rack, where Werdegast proceeds to literally skin him alive. As Joan tries to tear a key from the dead Poelzig's hand, Peter, just regaining consciousness, mistakes Werdegast's attempt to help her as an attack on her and shoots Werdegast. Fatally wounded, Werdegast blows up the house, first letting the couple escape but with Poelzig's \"rotten cult\" still upstairs. \"It has been a good game, Hjalmar,\" he says before he dies.","m_cast":"Boris Karloff as Hjalmar Poelzig | Béla Lugosi as Dr. Vitus Werdegast | David Manners as Peter Alison | Julie Bishop as Joan Alison | Egon Brecher as The Majordomo | Harry Cording as Thamal | Lucille Lund as Karen Werdegast | Henry Armetta as Police Sergeant | Albert Conti as Police Lieutenant | John Carradine as Organist (uncredited)[5] | Cast notes | Lund also plays the elder Karen Werdegast.","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Black Cat was the biggest box office hit of the year for Universal[4] and was the first of eight movies (six of which were produced by Universal) to pair actors Béla Lugosi and Boris Karloff.

The film exploited the popularity of Poe and the horror genre, as well as a sudden public interest in psychiatry.[6] | The film has little to do with Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Black Cat\", though Poe's name is listed in the credits.
