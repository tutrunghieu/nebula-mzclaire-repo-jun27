Our journey is entirely imaginary, which is its strength.\"[8] The main character is an aging socialite, Jep Gambardella, who once wrote a famous novel in his twenties, only to retire into a comfortable life writing cultural columns and throwing parties in Rome. After his 65th birthday party, he walks through the ruins and city streets, encountering the various characters, reflecting on his life, his first love, and sense of unfulfillment.[9][10][11] [12]","m_cast":"Toni Servillo as Jep Gambardella | Carlo Verdone as Romano | Sabrina Ferilli as Ramona | Carlo Buccirosso as Lello Cava | Giovanna Vignola as Dadina | Iaia Forte as Trumeau | Pamela Villoresi as Viola | Galatea Ranzi as Stefania | Franco Graziosi as Count Colonna | Sonia Gessner as Countess Colonna | Giorgio Pasotti as Stefano | Giusi Merli as Sister Maria | Luca Marinelli as Andrea | Massimo Popolizio as Alfio Bracco | Serena Grandi as Lorena | Ivan Franek as Ron Sweet | Roberto Herlitzka as Cardinal Bellucci | Isabella Ferrari as Orietta | Fanny Ardant as herself | Antonello Venditti as himself | Francesca Amodio as Carmelina","m_reception":"The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating, based on 113 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 7.8/10.

He likened it to Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City and Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita in its ambition to record a period of Roman history on film. \"Rossellini covered the Nazi occupation of 1944; Fellini the seductive, empty hedonism of the years that followed. Sorrentino's plan is to do the same for the Berlusconi era,\" he wrote.[17] Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter stated \"Sorrentino's vision of moral chaos and disorder, spiritual and emotional emptiness at this moment in time is even darker than Fellini's (though Ettore Scola's The Terrace certainly comes in somewhere).\"[18] Critics have also identified other purposefully explicit film homages: to Roma, 8½,[19][20] Scola's Splendor,[20] Michelangelo Antonioni's La notte.[21] Spanish film director Pedro Almodóvar named the film as one of the twelve best films of 2013, placing it second in his list.[22] | Various critics have named the film as one of the best of 2013. | 1st: Time Out London's 10 Best films of 2013[23] | 1st: Robbie Collin, The Telegraph[24] | 2nd: The Guardian[25] | 2nd: Richard Corliss, Time[26] | 3rd: Chris Vognar, The Dallas Morning News[27] | 4th: Sight & Sound[28] | 4th: Lisa Schwarzbaum, BBC[29] | 6th: Jake Coyle, Associated Press[30] | 7th: Stephen Holden, The New York Times[31] | 8th: Simon Abrams & Alan Scherstuhl, The Village Voice[32][33] | 9th: Robert Gifford, The Diamondback[34] | 9th: Empire's 50 Best Films Of 2013[35] | Best films of 2013: Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian[36] | Best Film of 2013: Justin Chang, Variety[37][38]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Paolo Sorrentino","m_produced_by":"Nicola Giuliano Francesca Cima Fabio Conversi","m_screenplay_by":"Paolo Sorrentino Umberto Contarello","m_story_by":"Paolo Sorrentino","m_starring":"Toni Servillo Carlo Verdone Sabrina Ferilli Carlo Buccirosso","m_music_by":"Lele Marchitelli","m_cinematography":"Luca Bigazzi","m_edited_by":"Cristiano Travaglioli","m_production_company":"Indigo Film Medusa Film Babe Films Pathé","m_distributed_by":"Medusa Film","m_release_dates":"21 May 2013 (2013-05-21)[1] |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"142 minutes","m_country":"Italy France","m_language":"Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese","m_budget":"€9.200.000","m_box_office":"$24.164.400[2] | The Great Beauty (Italian: La grande bellezza [la ˈɡrande belˈlettsa]) is a 2013 Italian comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino.
