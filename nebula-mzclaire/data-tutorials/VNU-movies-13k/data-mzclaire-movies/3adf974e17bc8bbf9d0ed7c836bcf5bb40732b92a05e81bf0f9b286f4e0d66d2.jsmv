{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Bill \"Stoker\" Thompson (Robert Ryan) is a 35-year-old has-been boxer about to take on an opponent at the fictional Paradise City Arena. His wife, Julie (Audrey Totter), fears that this fight may be his last and wants him to forfeit the match. Tiny (George Tobias), Stoker's manager, is sure he will continue to lose fights, so he takes money for a \"dive\" from a mobster, but is so certain of Stoker's failure that he does not inform the boxer of the set-up. | The beginning of the film shows Stoker and Julie in their room at the Hotel Cozy, passionately debating whether he should participate in the fight. Julie tells him that she has a headache and won't attend the match. Stoker claims the $500 prize could allow them to buy a cigar stand or invest in another boxer, Tony Martinez, and start a new life. Julie says she cares more about his well-being than money, but Stoker responds: \"If you're a fighter, you gotta fight.\" | After Stoker departs for the arena, Julie continues to struggle with her fear and desire to support him, but ultimately ends up not using her ticket to the event and instead roams the streets surrounding the arena. | At the beginning of the fourth and last round of the vicious match with the much younger and heavily favored Tiger Nelson (Hal Fieberling), Stoker learns about the fix. Even though he is told that Little Boy (Alan Baxter), a feared gangster, is behind the set-up, he refuses to give up the fight. | Stoker wins the vocal support of blood-thirsty fans who had at first rooted against him and ends up defeating his opponent. He pays for his decision with a beating in an alley outside the arena from Little Boy, Tiger Nelson, and their cronies. The group irreparably damages Stoker's hand with a smash from a brick. | The story closes with Julie meeting Stoker as he staggers out of the alley and collapses into her arms. \"I won tonight,\" he tells her. \"Yes,\" she answers. \"You won tonight. We both won tonight.\"","m_cast":"Robert Ryan as Bill \"Stoker\" Thompson | Audrey Totter as Julie Thompson | George Tobias as Tiny | Alan Baxter as Little Boy | Wallace Ford as Gus | Percy Helton as Red | Hal Fieberling as \"Tiger\" Nelson | Darryl Hickman as Shanley | Kenny O'Morrison as Moore | James Edwards as Luther Hawkins | David Clarke as \"Gunboat\" Johnson | Phillip Pine as Tony Souza | Arthur 'Weegee' Fellig (New York photographer) has a cameo as the timekeeper","m_reception":"When the film was released The New York Times reviewed the drama and lauded the picture's screenplay and the realistic depiction of the boxing milieu; they wrote: | Jefferson Hunter, in a summer 2008 essay for The Hudson Review, said: | Wins | 1949 Cannes Film Festival: Best Cinematography, Milton R. Krasner; FIPRESCI Prize, Robert Wise; 1949.[8] | Nominated | British Academy of Film and Television Arts: BAFTA Film Award, Best Film from any Source, United States; 1950.","m_production":"In an audio commentary accompanying the 2004 DVD release of the film, Robert Wise attributes the change in the protagonist's race to the fact that RKO had no African-American star actors under contract.[4] Although the film did have an African American actor (James Edwards) in a minor role as another boxer, Edwards was not a \"star\" under the then existing studio rules. March later commented in an Ebony interview, saying: | Robert Ryan, who was cast as Stoker Thompson, had boxing experience from his time at Dartmouth College, where he was heavyweight champion for four years in a row.[4][5] | Wise and Sid Rogell had first thought of Joan Blondell to play Julie, following her performance as Zeena Krumbein in Nightmare Alley, but RKO owner Howard Hughes refused, saying \"Blondell looks like she was shot out of the wrong end of a cannon now\".[6] | Dore Schary, the uncredited executive producer who got the project going at RKO before his 1948 move to MGM,[1] is credited with giving the film a real time narrative structure, three years before the device was used in High Noon.[1] Viewers are shown the passage of time throughout the film: | 9:05 pm: The opening sequence features a clock in the town's square. | 9:11 pm: An alarm clock wakes Stoker. | 9:17 pm: Stoker leaves for the fight. | 9:35 pm: Julie paces with indecision, takes her ticket to the event, and leaves their room. Stoker sees the lights go off from across the street and believes she will be at the match. | 10:10 pm: Having returned to the room, Julie warms soup on the stove while Stoker is beaten in an alley across the street. | 10:16 pm: The long shot of the clock and the town square returns for the closing sequence. | Prior to The Set-Up, Richard Goldstone's production credits had been limited to a half-dozen Our Gang comedy shorts.[1] | The fight scene, which features an exchange of blows between Stoker and his opponent that is very close to the original poem,[1] was choreographed by former professional boxer Johnny Indrisano.[4] Wise used three cameras to capture the action: one focused on the ring in its entirety; one on the fighters; and a third, hand-held device to catch details such as a glove connecting with a body.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"a poem  by Joseph Moncure March","m_directed_by":"Robert Wise","m_produced_by":"Richard Goldstone","m_screenplay_by":"Art Cohn","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Robert Ryan | Audrey Totter | George Tobias","m_music_by":"C.
