Dyer \"opened up\" the script to show the couple's neighborhood, expanded the action to cover a period of ten days, and added characters. Rex Harrison and Richard Burton portrayed the couple and Cathleen Nesbitt and Beatrix Lehmann were featured as their mothers. | The film was produced by 20th Century Fox. | Because of Great Britain's tax laws, the stars insisted that the film be shot in Paris, which added to the film's budget, already inflated by their salaries ($1 million for Harrison, $1.25 million for Burton). Reportedly Elizabeth Taylor was shooting 1970's The Only Game in Town at the same time as this film was in production. While that film is set in Las Vegas, Taylor demanded that director George Stevens shoot in France so she could be close to her husband. This caused the budget of The Only Game in Town to grow higher than most large-scale, high-profile films that Fox was producing at the time. | The film's score was composed by musician/comedian Dudley Moore.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stanley Donen","m_produced_by":"Stanley Donen","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Rex Harrison Richard Burton","m_music_by":"Dudley Moore","m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation","m_release_dates":"1969Â (1969) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"96 min","m_country":"France","m_language":null,"m_budget":"$6,370,000[1]","m_box_office":"$1,850,000 (US/ Canada rentals)[2] | Staircase is a 1969 film adaptation of a two-character play, also called Staircase, by Charles Dyer.
