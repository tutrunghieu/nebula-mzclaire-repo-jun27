He stated, \"This is a film that focuses on a nostalgic event during a difficult time in American history and features one of the most beloved sports of the respective culture, so I understand how it's hard not to get wrapped up in teary-eyed, patriotic, spiritual emotions when watching this film. All I ask is for one to remember films of the sports genre that are acclaimed and highly regarded and ask themselves why they are so beloved; the answers vary, but one of them is that they don't use their setting as their primary feature nor do they define characters solely by their position on the field and their race.\"[11]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Andrew Erwin Jon Erwin","m_produced_by":"Kevin Downes | Daryl Lefever","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Sean Astin | Nic Bishop | Caleb Castille | Sherri Shepherd | Jon Voight | C.
