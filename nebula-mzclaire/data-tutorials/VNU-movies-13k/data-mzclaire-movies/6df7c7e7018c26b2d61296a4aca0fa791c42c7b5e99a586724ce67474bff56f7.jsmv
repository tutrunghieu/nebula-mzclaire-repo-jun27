Sarah eventually leaves Macon, moving out of their house and into an apartment. After he falls down the basement stairs and breaks his leg, Macon returns to his childhood home to stay with his eccentric siblings. | Macon is pursued by Muriel Pritchett (Geena Davis), an animal hospital employee and dog trainer with a sickly son. Macon eventually hires Muriel to put his dog through much-needed obedience training.

When Sarah becomes aware of the situation, she decides they should move back together into their old home. Macon leaves Muriel, and he and Sarah set up house once more. | When Macon visits Paris for research, Muriel surprises him by showing up on the same flight and stays in the same Paris hotel, recommended by Macon in one of his travel guides. She suggests that they enjoy themselves as if they are vacationing together. Macon insists he is there strictly for business, and he keeps Muriel at arm's length. | After Macon is bedridden in his room by his back problem, Sarah comes to Paris to care for him and make day-trips to help complete his travel research. After some time, Sarah confronts Macon about his relationship with Muriel, but he refuses to discuss the situation in any depth. | Macon dresses while Sarah still sleeps, then wakes her to tell her that he is going back to Muriel. On the way to the airport, Macon spots Muriel hailing a taxi and tells the driver to stop. Thinking the driver stopped for her, Muriel bends to gather her luggage and catches sight of Macon in the taxi. She smiles, and Macon returns the smile.","m_cast":"William Hurt as Macon Leary | Kathleen Turner as Sarah Leary | Geena Davis as Muriel Pritchett | Bill Pullman as Julian | Amy Wright as Rose Leary | David Ogden Stiers as Porter Leary | Ed Begley, Jr. as Charles Leary","m_reception":"Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it four out of four stars.[2]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Accidental Tourist  by Anne Tyler","m_directed_by":"Lawrence Kasdan","m_produced_by":"Lawrence Kadan Charles Okun Michael Grillo","m_screenplay_by":"Frank Galati Lawrence Kasdan","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"William Hurt | Kathleen Turner | Geena Davis","m_music_by":"John Williams","m_cinematography":"John Bailey","m_edited_by":"Carol Littleton","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.","m_release_dates":"December 23, 1988 (1988-12-23) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"121 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$32,632,093 (United States) | The Accidental Tourist is a 1988 American drama film starring William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis.
