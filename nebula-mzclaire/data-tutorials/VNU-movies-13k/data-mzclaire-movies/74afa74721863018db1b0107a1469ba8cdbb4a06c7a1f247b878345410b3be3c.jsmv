{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in \"Barrytown\", a fictitious working-class quarter of Dublin. Brendan \"Bimbo\" Reeves gets laid off from his job as a baker. With his redundancy cheque, he buys a van and sells fish and chips with his best mate, Larry. Due, in part, to Ireland's surprising success at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, their business starts off well. But the relationship between the two friends soon becomes strained as Bimbo and his wife, Maggie behave more and more like typical bosses. Larry believes that Maggie is the cause of the strained friendship, as he thinks she is pushing Bimbo away from him. The van is closed down because of poor hygiene by health inspector, Des O'Callaghan. Bimbo thinks that Larry told the Health Board about the van, leading to a fight between the two. Larry quits the job, despite Bimbo's best efforts to get him back. Bimbo then drives the van into the sea, so as to win his friendship with Larry back.","m_cast":"Colm Meaney - Larry.

It is also the most thoughtful, in a way, and the ending has a poignancy and an unresolved quality that is just right: These disorganized lives would not fit into a neat ending.[3]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Stephen Frears","m_produced_by":"Lynda Myles Mark Shivas","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Colm Meaney Donal O'Kelly Ger Ryan Caroline Rothwell Neilí Conroy Rúaidhrí Conroy Brendan O'Carroll Stuart Dunne","m_music_by":"Eric Clapton Richard Hartley","m_cinematography":"Oliver Stapleton","m_edited_by":"Mick Audsley","m_production_company":"Beacon Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","m_release_dates":"11 May 1996 (1996-05-11) (Cannes) | 29 November 1996 (1996-11-29) (UK) | 16 May 1997 (1997-05-16) (US) |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes","m_country":"Ireland","m_language":"English | The Van is a 1996 film, based on the novel The Van (the third in The Barrytown Trilogy) by Roddy Doyle.
