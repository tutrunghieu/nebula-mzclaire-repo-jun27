{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 17th century New England, a man named William is banished from a Puritan plantation alongside his family–his wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas. In their state of exile, the family builds a farm by the edge of a large, secluded forest far from the Puritan settlement. Katherine soon gives birth to her fifth child, Samuel. While being closely watched by Thomasin, Samuel mysteriously vanishes from her presence. It is then revealed that Samuel was kidnapped by a witch living in the woods, who kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a topical ointment for her body.[6] | Katherine, devastated by Samuel's disappearance, spends her days crying and praying. William takes Caleb hunting in the forest, where Caleb confronts his father about his unbaptized fate. William, in turn, confides to his son that he traded Katherine's prized silver cup for hunting supplies. On the farm, the twins play with the family's black goat, Black Phillip, whom they claim speaks to them. That night, Katherine blames Thomasin for the disappearance of her silver cup while also implying she was responsible for Samuel going missing. As the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family. | The next morning, Caleb and Thomasin sneak away to go hunting in the forest. Their dog gives chase to a hare and Caleb follows, leaving Thomasin astride the horse, which throws her and knocks her unconscious. Caleb, now lost in the woods, finds the disemboweled corpse of his dog. Wandering further into the woods, he is lured into a hovel by the witch disguised as a young woman. Thomasin awakens and, guided by her father's calls, finds her way home. As Katherine confronts Thomasin about going into the woods, William reluctantly admits that he sold her silver cup. | That night, Caleb returns to the farm naked and delirious from an unknown illness. Katherine suggests her son's mysterious ailment is due to witchcraft and prays over Caleb. The next day, Caleb suffers a violent seizure and passionately proclaims his love for Christ before dying peacefully. In the aftermath of Caleb's death, the twins accuse Thomasin of witchcraft, to which she counters their accusations by revealing the twins' ability to converse with Black Phillip. Enraged at their behavior, William boards up Thomasin and the twins inside the stable with the goats. | After dark, the twins and Thomasin awaken to find the witch inside the stable, drinking the blood of the animals. In the house, Katherine is overjoyed by a vision of Caleb and Samuel's return. She begins breastfeeding the infant; in reality, a raven pecks at her exposed breast while she laughs hysterically. The next day, William finds the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated and bloodless, the twins missing, and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood stains on her hands. As Thomasin awakens, William is then suddenly gored to death by Black Phillip. A deranged Katherine, blaming Thomasin for her husband's death and the twins' disappearance, tries to strangle her daughter but is killed in self-defense by Thomasin. | That night, Thomasin enters the ruined stable and speaks to Black Phillip. The goat responds and is revealed to be Satan in disguise, who takes the form of a man. He convinces her to sign her name in his book, offering her the sights of the world and the life she wants to live. Thomasin agrees, and wanders naked into the forest with Black Phillip alongside her. She eventually finds a coven of nude women surrounding a bonfire holding a Witches' Sabbath. The witches begin to levitate, and a cackling Thomasin joins them; rising above the trees and completing her transformation and identity as a witch.","m_cast":"Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin | Ralph Ineson as William | Kate Dickie as Katherine | Harvey Scrimshaw as Caleb | Ellie Grainger as Mercy | Lucas Dawson as Jonas | Julian Richings as The Governor | Bathsheba Garnett as Witch | Sarah Stephens as Young Witch | Wahab Chaudhry as Black Phillip | Axtun Henry Dube and Athan Conrad Dube as Samuel","m_reception":"The Witch has grossed $25.1 million in North America and $14.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $39.8 million.[5] | In the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking suggested the film would gross $5–7 million from 2,046 theaters in its opening weekend, trailing fellow newcomer Risen ($7–12 million projection) but similar to opener Race ($4–7 million projection).[18] The film grossed $3.3 million on its first day and $8.8 million in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office behind Deadpool ($56.5 million), Kung Fu Panda 3 ($12.5 million) and Risen ($11.8 million).[19] | The Witch received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 91%, based on 241 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"As thought-provoking as it is visually compelling, The Witch delivers a deeply unsettling exercise in slow-building horror that suggests great things for debuting writer-director Robert Eggers.\"[20] Metacritic reports a score of 83 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[21] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale.[19] | Variety commented, \"A fiercely committed ensemble and an exquisite sense of historical detail conspire to cast a highly atmospheric spell in The Witch, a strikingly achieved tale of a mid-17th-century New England family’s steady descent into religious hysteria and madness.\"[22] Yohana Desta of Mashable stated that The Witch is a \"stunningly crafted experience that'll have you seeking out a church as soon as you leave the theater.\"[23] Peter Travers in his Rolling Stone review gave the film 3 1/2 stars, and wrote of The Witch \"Building his film on the diabolical aftershocks of Puritan repression, Eggers raises The Witch far above the horror herd. He doesn't need cheap tricks. Eggers merely directs us to look inside.\"[24] Stephanie Zacharek summarized the movie in Time as \"a triumph of tone\", writing that \"Although Eggers is extremely discreet—the things you don’t see are more horrifying than those you do—the picture’s relentlessness sometimes feels like torment.\"[25] Gregory Wakeman from Cinemablend rated it five stars, writing that \"[its] acting, lighting, music, writing, production design, cinematography, editing, and direction all immediately impress. While, at the same time, they combine to create an innately bewitching tale that keeps you on tenterhooks all the way up until its grandiose but enthralling finale.\"[26] Ann Hornaday wrote in The Washington Post that the film joins the ranks of horror films such as The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby, saying that The Witch \"comports itself less like an imitator of those classics than their progenitor... a tribute to a filmmaker who, despite his newcomer status, seems to have arrived in the full throes of maturity, in full control of his prodigious powers.\"[27] | However, some critics as well as audiences were less pleased with the film; New York Daily News wrote that while the film does not suffer from the cinematography, acting, or setting, early on it \"seems that The Witch is tapping a higher metaphor for coming of age...or religious intolerance...or man's uneasy balance with nature...or something. It doesn't take long into the film's hour and a half running time, however, to break that spell.\"[28] Critics have noted that the film has received backlash from audiences in regarding the film's themes and scariness;[29] HitFix writer Chris Eggertson was critical of mainstream Hollywood and summarized that the film \"got under my skin profoundly, but it did not have the moment-to-moment, audience-pleasing shocks that moviegoers have become accustomed to thanks to movies like Sinister and The Purge and Paranormal Activity and every other Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes title in the canon.\"[30] Lesley Coffin criticized A24, saying it was \"a huge mistake\" to market The Witch as a terrifying horror movie. \"Not because it doesn’t fit into the genre of horror, but because of the power of expectations. The less you know about this movie the better your experience will be, but everyone who saw it opening weekend probably walked in with too much knowledge and hype to really get as much out of it as they could have if the film had the veil of mystery.\"[31] | Horror authors Stephen King and Brian Keene both reacted positively towards the film; King tweeted significant praise for the film, stating, \"The Witch scared the hell out of me. And it's a real movie, tense and thought-provoking as well as visceral\",[32] while Keene, on social media, stated \"The Witch is a gorgeous, thoughtful, scary horror film that 90% of the people in the theater with you will be too stupid to understand.\"[33] Jason Coffman expressed his \"frustration\" toward viewers who felt The Witch was \"boring\", saying \"[T]hese detractors have targeted [these] films that work within the genre but are also examples of how genre cinema can explore concepts and themes in ways that less fantastic stories cannot. In short, the rejection of these films appears to people outside of horror fandom as a rejection of cinema as an art form.\"[34] | Julia Alexander of Polygon states that The Witch \"asks people to try and understand what life would have been like for a family of devout Christians living in solitude, terrified of what may happen if they go against the word of God.\"[35] In The Atlantic, Alissa Wilkinson stated that films featured at the Sundance Film Festival, The Witch, along with Last Days in the Desert, Don Verdean, and I Am Michael reveal a \"resurgence of interest in the religious\" and described The Witch as \"a chilling circa-1600 story of the devil taking over a devout, Scripture-quoting family.\"[36] Eve Tushnet commented in an article in TAC, which was also published in First Things, that The Witch's view of witchcraft is \"not revisionist\" and further states that the film is \"pervaded by the fear of God. There are occasional references to His mercy but only as something to beg for, not something to trust in\".[37][38] Plugged In similarly opined that the protagonist of The Witch, \"William is absolutely devoted to leading his family in holiness and the ways of the Lord, which should be a good thing. But the fruit of William's rigorous focus on dogmatic piety isn't a lifting of burdens, which we're told should happen in Matthew 11:30, or a joyful celebration of living life to the fullest, as is referenced in John 10:10; rather it is deep fear and morbid meditations on hell, damnation and the forces of spiritual darkness.\"[39] However, Josh Larsen of Think Christian explained the conclusion of the film, stating that in \"encountering evil, the family in the film veers wildly back and forth between 'triumphalism' and 'defeatism,' two theological extremes\" and \"in refusing to allow for grace, they become easy pickings for the witch.\"[40] | A spokesperson for the nontheist Satanic Temple, Jex Blackmore, claimed that A24 \"approached the temple to say it believed the film would be of interest to members, though it didn't specifically ask for an endorsement.\"[41] However, the Satanic Temple endorsed the film, even going as far as starting a tour for the film, which began on February 10, 2016.[41] The Satanist group believes \"[the film] will signal the call-to-arms for a Satanic uprising against the tyrannical vestiges of bigoted superstitions, and will harken a new era of liberation and unfettered inquiry\", and started a website where people can \"officially register themselves into 'The Book of Satan'.\"[42] Nevertheless, Todd VanDerWerff of Vox stated that \"A24 could have just as easily courted the approval of, say, theologians who have a fondness for Calvinism. The Witch takes place in Colonial America, and it unfolds from the perspective of period Christians who genuinely believe the woods around their tiny farm contain some sort of evil, supernatural being—and are ultimately proved correct.\"[41]","m_production":"The film was partially based on Eggers' childhood fascination with witches. After unsuccessfully pitching films that were \"too weird, too obscure\", Eggers realized that he would have to make a more conventional film.[7] He said at a Q&A, \"If I'm going to make a genre film, it has to be personal and it has to be good.\"[7] | Eggers wanted to film the picture on location in New England but the lack of tax incentives meant he had to settle for Canada.[7] This proved to be somewhat of a problem for Eggers, because he could not find the forest environment he was looking for in the country.[7] They had to go \"off the map\", eventually finding a location (Kiosk, Ontario) that was \"extremely remote\"; Eggers said that the nearest town \"made New Hampshire look like a metropolis\".[7] | The production team worked extensively with English and American museums, as well as consulting English, seventeenth-century, agricultural experts.[8] The film was produced in several locations in what is known as Mattawa Voyageur Country.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Eggers","m_produced_by":"Rodrigo Teixeira | Daniel Bekerman | Lars Knudsen | Jodi Redmond | Jay Van Hoy","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Anya Taylor-Joy | Ralph Ineson | Kate Dickie | Harvey Scrimshaw | Ellie Grainger | Lucas Dawson","m_music_by":"Mark Korven","m_cinematography":"Jarin Blaschke","m_edited_by":"Louise Ford","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"A24","m_release_dates":"January 27, 2015 (2015-01-27) (Sundance Film Festival) | February 19, 2016 (2016-02-19) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"93 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States | Canada[2][3]","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$3 million[4]","m_box_office":"$39.8 million[5] | The Witch (stylized as The VVitch, subtitled A New-England Folktale) is a 2015 supernatural horror film written and directed by Robert Eggers, in his directorial debut.

But the festival’s lineup revealed a resurgence of interest in the religious: In Don Verdean, an affectionately satirical comedy, Sam Rockwell stars as a “Biblical archaeologist” who becomes a pawn in a war between two rival local ministers. The Witch, a pristine horror debut from writer/director Robert Eggers, is a chilling circa-1600 story of the devil taking over a devout, Scripture-quoting family. I Am Michael, executive produced by Gus Van Sant, tells the true story of Michael Glatze (played by James Franco), a former gay activist who denounced homosexuality and became a Christian pastor. Other films like Z for Zachariah and Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl subtly draw on questions and motifs that animate Biblical narratives and questions.  | ^ Tushnet, Eve (February 26, 2016). \"Out in the Fields with God\".
