{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) journeys to the remote Hebridean island, Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison (Gerry Cowper). Howie, a devout Christian, is disturbed to find the islanders paying homage to the pagan Celtic gods of their ancestors. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the May Day celebrations, teach children of the phallic association of the maypole, and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The Islanders, including Rowan's mother (Irene Sunters), attempt to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed. | While staying at the Green Man Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each image featuring a young girl as the May Queen. The photograph of the latest celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. The landlord's daughter, Willow (Britt Eklund), attempts to seduce Howie, but he refuses to have premarital sex. | After seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island leader, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), grandson of a Victorian agronomist. Lord Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland's climate, and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced the pagan religion. | Howie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes. His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next will be bountiful. He comes to the conclusion that Rowan is alive and has been chosen for sacrifice. During the May Day celebration, Howie knocks out and ties up the innkeeper so he can steal his costume and mask (that of Punch, the fool) and infiltrate the parade. When it seems the villagers are about to sacrifice Rowan, he cuts her free and flees with her. They are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns. | Lord Summerisle tells Howie that Rowan is not the intended sacrifice — Howie himself is. He fits their gods' four requirements: he came of his own free will, with \"the power of a king\" (by representing the Law), is a virgin, and is a fool. Defiant, Howie loudly warns Lord Summerisle and the islanders that the fruit-tree strains are failing permanently and that the villagers will turn on him (Lord Summerisle) and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails as well; Summerisle angrily insists that the sacrifice of the \"willing, king-like, virgin fool\" will be accepted and that the next harvest will not fail. The villagers force Howie inside a giant wicker man statue, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the Middle English folk song \"Sumer Is Icumen In\". Inside the wicker man, a terrified Howie recites Psalm 23, and prays to Christ. He curses the islanders as he burns to death. The wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Wicker Man had moderate success and won first prize in the 1974 Festival of Fantastic Films in Paris, but largely slipped into obscurity. In 1977 the American film magazine Cinefantastique devoted a commemorative issue to the film,[30] asserting that the film is \"the Citizen Kane of horror movies\" – an oft-quoted phrase attributed to this issue.[31] | British heavy metal band Iron Maiden wrote a song called \"The Wicker Man,\" inspired by the film, for their 2000 album Brave New World. | In 2003, the Crichton Campus of the University of Glasgow in Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway hosted a three-day conference on The Wicker Man.[32] The conference led to two collections of articles about the film. | In 2006, The Wicker Man ranked 45th on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.[33] | Decades after its release, the film still receives positive reviews from critics and is considered one of the best films of 1973.[34][35] The Wicker Man currently holds a 90% \"Fresh\" rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[36] In 2008, The Wicker Man was ranked by Empire Magazine as 485th of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[37] Christopher Lee considered The Wicker Man his best film.[13] Edward Woodward meanwhile has said that The Wicker Man is one of his favourite films and that the character of Howie was the best part he ever played. In addition to Lee's admiration of the final shot of the film (of the collapsing Wicker man), Woodward said that it is the best final shot of any film ever made.[38] | In his 2010 BBC documentary series A History of Horror, writer and actor Mark Gatiss referred to the film as a prime example of a short-lived subgenre he called \"folk horror\", grouping it with 1968's Witchfinder General and 1971's The Blood on Satan's Claw.[39][40] | In May 2016, British band Radiohead released the music video for a song named \"Burn the Witch\", made in stop-motion animation and whose storyline greatly resembles that of The Wicker Man.[41][42][43]","m_production":"In the early 1970s, the actor Christopher Lee was a Hammer Horror regular, best known for his roles in a series of successful films, beginning with The Curse of Frankenstein (as the monster, 1957). Lee wanted to break free of this image and take on more interesting acting roles. He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centering on \"old religion\", in sharp contrast to the Hammer films they had both seen as horror film fans.[6] | Shaffer read the David Pinner novel Ritual, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Pinner originally wrote Ritual as a film treatment for director Michael Winner, who had John Hurt in mind as a possible star.[7] Winner eventually declined the project, so Pinner's agent convinced him to write Ritual as a novel instead.[8] Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 for the rights to the novel, and Shaffer set to work on the screenplay. He soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well and drafted a new story based only loosely on the story of the novel.[9] | Shaffer wanted the film to be \"a little more literate\" than the average horror picture. He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore. He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary. The focus of the film was crystallised when he \"finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice\". The image of the wicker man, which gave the filmmakers their title, was taken from one sentence in Julius Caesar's account of his wars in what is now France. Caesar claimed that the local tribes there had executed their most serious criminals by burning them alive in a huge man-shaped sculpture of woven twigs. For Shaffer, this was \"the most alarming and imposing image that I had ever seen\".[10] The idea of a confrontation between a modern Christian and a remote, pagan community continued to intrigue Shaffer, who performed painstaking research on paganism. Brainstorming with Hardy, they conceived the film as presenting the pagan elements objectively and accurately, accompanied by authentic music and a believable, contemporary setting.[11] One of their main resources was The Golden Bough, a study of mythology and religion written by Scottish anthropologist James Frazer.[12] | Television actor Edward Woodward was cast in the role of Sergeant Neil Howie after the part was declined by both Michael York and David Hemmings.[14] In Britain, Woodward was best known for the role of Callan, which he played from 1967 to 1972. After The Wicker Man, Woodward went on to receive international attention for his roles in the 1980 film Breaker Morant and the 1980s TV series The Equalizer. | After Shaffer saw her on the stage, he lured Diane Cilento out of semi-retirement to play the town's schoolmistress.[14] (They lived together in Queensland from 1975, and married in 1985.) Ingrid Pitt, another British horror film veteran, was cast as the town librarian and registrar. The Swedish actress Britt Ekland was cast as the innkeeper's lascivious daughter, although two body doubles were used for her naked scenes — as Ekland was three months pregnant with her son Nic, to Lou Adler. Stuart Hopps (the film's choreographer) called upon the services of a London-based 'exotic dancer' called \"Miss P.\" who gyrated at the doorway, whilst local 18-year-old extra, Jane Jackson was filmed in the wall scenes (although in reality, the bedrooms of Willow and Sergeant Howie were not 'through the wall' from each other: Willow's was upstairs in the Cally Estates offices in Gatehouse of Fleet whilst Howie's was 35 miles (56 kilometres) away in a family home in the Main Street of Whithorn). Her dialogue and singing voice were later dubbed by Scottish singer Annie Ross.[15][16] | The film was produced at a time of crisis for the British film industry. The studio in charge of production, British Lion Films, was in financial trouble and was bought by wealthy businessman John Bentley. To convince the unions that he was not about to asset-strip the company, Bentley needed to get a film into production quickly. This meant that The Wicker Man, a film set during spring, actually began filming in October 1972: artificial leaves and blossoms had to be glued to trees in many scenes. The production was kept on a small budget.[14] Christopher Lee was extremely keen to get the film made; he and others worked on the production without pay. While filming took place, British Lion was bought by EMI Films. | The film was shot almost entirely in the small Scottish towns of Gatehouse of Fleet, Newton Stewart, Kirkcudbright and a few scenes in the village of Creetown in Dumfries and Galloway, as well as Plockton in Ross-shire. Some scenes were filmed in and around the Isle of Whithorn, where the owners of the castle, Elizabeth McAdam McLaughland and David Wheatley, plus several other local people featured in various scenes.[17] Culzean Castle in Ayrshire and its grounds were also used for much of the shooting. Some of the opening flying shoots feature the Isle of Skye, including the spectacular pinnacles of The Old Man of Storr and the Quiraing. The amphibious aircraft that takes Sergeant Howie from the religious certainties of the mainland to the ancient beliefs of the island was a Thurston Teal, owned and flown in the aerial sequences by Christopher Murphy. The end burning of the Wicker Man occurred at Burrow Head (on a caravan site). According to Britt Ekland, some animals did actually perish inside the Wicker Man,[18] whereas Robin Hardy said in an interview that great care was taken to ensure that the animals were in no danger of being hurt during this scene and that they were not inside the Wicker Man when it was set on fire.[19] | The film's soundtrack often forms a major component of the narrative, just as with other important arthouse films of the era such as Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance.[20] Songs accompany many important scenes, such as the plane's arrival, Willow's dancing, the maypole dance, the girls jumping through fire, the search of the houses, the procession, and the final burning scene. Indeed, according to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary, director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a \"musical\". | Composed, arranged and recorded by Paul Giovanni and Magnet (in some versions of the film credited as \"Lodestone\"), the soundtrack contains 13 folk songs performed by characters in the film. The songs vary between traditional songs, original Giovanni compositions and even nursery rhyme in \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\". | \"Willow's Song\" has been covered or sampled by various rock music bands. It was covered by Sneaker Pimps as \"How Do\", and can be heard in the movie Hostel (2005) where the song is incorrectly credited in the end titles as being composed by The Sneaker Pimps. The song is also included on their 1996 release Becoming X. The band has also covered \"Gently Johnny\" as \"Johnny\" and is featured as a B-Side on their \"Roll On\" (1996) single. It also was covered by Faith and the Muse on their 2003 album The Burning Season. The Mock Turtles released a version of the song on their album Turtle Soup. | The songs on the soundtrack were not actual cult songs used by pagans. The songs were composed or arranged from traditional songs by Paul Giovanni. Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns' \"Corn Riggs\" accompanies Howie's arrival on Summerisle. The song sung by the cultists of Summerisle at the end of the film, \"Sumer Is Icumen In\" is a mid-13th-century song about nature in spring.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Ritual  by David Pinner","m_directed_by":"Robin Hardy","m_produced_by":"Peter Snell","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Edward Woodward Britt Ekland Diane Cilento Ingrid Pitt Christopher Lee","m_music_by":"Paul Giovanni","m_cinematography":"Harry Waxman","m_edited_by":"Eric Boyd-Perkins","m_production_company":"British Lion Films","m_distributed_by":"British Lion Films","m_release_dates":"December 1973 (1973-12) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"£500,000[2] | The Wicker Man is a 1973 British mystery horror film written by Anthony Shaffer and directed by Robin Hardy. The film stars Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento, Ingrid Pitt, and Christopher Lee. Paul Giovanni composed the soundtrack. The story was inspired by David Pinner's 1967 novel Ritual and centres on the visit of Police Sergeant Neil Howie to the isolated island of Summerisle, in search of a missing girl. Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned Christianity and now practise a form of Celtic paganism. | The Wicker Man is generally well-regarded by critics. Film magazine Cinefantastique described it as \"The Citizen Kane of horror movies\", and in 2004 the magazine Total Film named The Wicker Man the sixth greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. The burning Wicker Man scene was No. 45 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the film was included as part of a sequence that celebrated British cinema. In 2013, a copy of the original U.S. theatrical version was digitally restored and released. | In 1989, Shaffer wrote a script treatment for The Loathsome Lambton Worm, a direct sequel with fantasy elements. Hardy had no interest in the project, and it was never produced. In 2006, an ill-received[3] American remake was released, from which Hardy and others involved with the original have dissociated themselves. In 2011, a spiritual sequel entitled The Wicker Tree was released to mixed reviews. This film was also directed by Hardy, and featured Lee in a cameo appearance. Hardy was working on his next film, The Wrath of the Gods, which would have completed The Wicker Man Trilogy, at the time of his death on July 1, 2016.[4][5] |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE WICKER MAN 1973 (XV)\".
