{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Ahmad ibn Fadlan is a court poet to the Caliph of Baghdad, until his amorous encounter with the wife of an influential noble gets him exiled as an \"ambassador\" to Northern Barbarians. Traveling with Melchisidek, his caravan is saved from Turkic raiders by the appearance of Norsemen (presumably Varangian). Taking refuge at their settlement on the Volga river, communications are established through Melchisidek and Herger, a Norseman who speaks Latin. Ahmad and Melchisidek are in time to witness a fight, which establishes Buliwyf as heir apparent, followed by the Viking funeral of their dead king, cremated together with a young woman who agreed to accompany him to Valhalla. | A youth enters the camp requesting Buliwyf's aid: his father's kingdom in the far north is under attack from an ancient evil so frightening that even the bravest warriors dare not name it. The \"angel of death\", a völva (wisewoman), determines the mission will be successful if thirteen warriors go to face this danger—but the thirteenth must not be a Norseman. Ahmad is recruited against his will. | Ahmad learns Norse during their journey by listening intently to his companions' conversations. He is looked down upon by the huge Norsemen, who mock his physical weakness and his small Arabian horse, but he earns a measure of respect by his fast learning of their language, his horsemanship, ingenuity, and ability to write. | Reaching King Hrothgar's kingdom, they confirm that their foe is indeed the ancient \"Wendol\", fiends who come with the mist to kill and eat human flesh. While the group searches through a raided cabin they find a venus figurine. On their first night three of their number - Hyglak, Ragnar and Haltaf are killed. In a string of clashes, Buliwyf's band establishes that the Wendol are humanoid cannibals who appear as, live like, and identify with bears. | Their numbers dwindling and their position all but indefensible, an ancient völva of the village tells them to track the Wendol to their lair and destroy their leaders, the \"Mother of the Wendol\" and their Warlord who wears \"the horns of power\". Buliwyf and the remaining warriors infiltrate the Wendol cave-complex and kill the Mother, but not before Buliwyf is scratched deeply across the shoulder by her poisoned \"fingernail claw\". | The remaining warriors return to the village and prepare for a final battle they do not expect to survive. Buliwyf staggers outside before the fight and inspires the warriors with a Viking prayer for the honored dead who will enter Valhalla. Buliwyf succeeds in killing the Wendol Warlord, causing their defeat, before succumbing to the poison. Ahmad ibn Fadlan witnesses Buliwyf's royal funeral before returning to his homeland, grateful to the Norsemen for helping him to \"become a man, and a useful servant of God\". He is shown at the movie's end writing down the tale of his time with them.","m_cast":"Antonio Banderas as Ahmed ibn Fadlan (13th Warrior) | Diane Venora as Queen Weilew | Vladimir Kulich as Buliwyf (1st Warrior) | Dennis Storhøi as Herger (Joyous) (11th Warrior) | Omar Sharif as Melchisidek | Clive Russell as Helfdane (Fat) (2nd Warrior) | Richard Bremmer as Skeld (Superstitious) (12th Warrior) | Tony Curran as Weath (Musician) (8th Warrior) | Eric Avari as Caravan leader | Sven Wollter as King Hrothgar | Asbjorn Riis as Halga (Wise) (10th Warrior) | Maria Bonnevie as Olga | Daniel Southern as Edgtho (Silent) (4th Warrior) | And also: | Mischa Hausserman as Rethel (Archer)(5th Warrior) | Neil Maffin as Roneth (Rider)(6th Warrior) | John DeSantis as Ragnar (Dour)(9th Warrior) | Oliver Sveinall as Haltaf (Boy) (7th Warrior) | Albie Woodington as Hyglak (Quarrelsome) (3rd Warrior)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Originally titled Eaters of the Dead, production began in the summer of 1997, but the film went through several re-edits after test audiences did not react well to the initial cut. Crichton took over as director himself due to the poor test audience reception, causing the release date to be pushed back over a year. The film was re-cut, a new ending added, along with a new score. Graeme Revell was replaced by Jerry Goldsmith as composer.

With all of the re-shoots and promotional expenses, the total cost of the film was rumored to be as high as $160 million, which given its lackluster box office take (earning US $61.7 million worldwide), made for a loss of $70–130 million.[2] | The film debuted at No. 2 on its opening weekend behind The Sixth Sense.[6] | The 13th Warrior holds a 33% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews.
