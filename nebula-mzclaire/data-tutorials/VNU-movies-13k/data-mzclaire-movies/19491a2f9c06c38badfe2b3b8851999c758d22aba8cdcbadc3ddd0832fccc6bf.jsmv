{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"\"Darn Cat\" or \"DC\" is a wily, adventurous Siamese tomcat who lives with two young women, suburbanite sisters Ingrid \"Inkie\" (Dorothy Provine) and Patricia \"Patti\" Randall (Hayley Mills), whose parents are traveling abroad at the time of the story. | One night, while making his rounds around town, teasing Blitzy the Bulldog as usual, DC from going to a delicatessen happens to stumble on and decides to follow Iggy (Frank Gorshin), a bank robber, to an apartment where he and his bank robber partner Dan (Neville Brand) are holding hostage a bank employee Miss Margaret Miller (Grayson Hall), whom they nickname \"Moms\". Without intention, the robbers let the cat in and he tries to eat on the food that caused him to follow Iggy. Regardless, only Iggy takes a somewhat sentimental liking to him and persuade Dan to letting him stay a while for that reason. | When Miss Miller is alone for a moment (but still under total eye surveillance of the robbers) being forced to cook the meal for them, she removes DC's collar to try and put her watch on him in place of it with a help inscription. In the process, she attempts to scratch the word \"help\" into the back of her watch (only managing to add \"H,E\" and only a partial \"L\", which only happens because of being interrupted by Iggy who asks what is keeping her from starting the steaks.) However forgetting to finish the inscription after being left alone again, she places it around the cat's neck, and releases him into the outdoors, which gets her in big trouble and makes her lose a huge chunk of her trust with the bank robbers of being turned loose inside. | Managing to make it home as usual, Patti discovers the watch, and gets a gut feeling that it belongs to the kidnapped woman and visits the FBI. She appeals to the looks of Agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones) and goes to him and tells him of her discovery. Through enough explanation, Kelso goes to Supervisor Newton (Richard Eastham) with it and assigns him to follow DC in hopes he will lead them back to the robbers' hideout. | Kelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls' house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance, but through a couple of careless moves, DC manages to elude them. Eventually a bugging device is implanted in DC's collar and the cat leads Kelso into a comical chase at a drive-in movie and several backyards. Through failed attempts getting anywhere and without hard evidence about the watch, Kelso through orders of Supervisor Newton shuts down the operation. Patti brings it back by disguising herself as a hippie merchant who pretends to be a niece to a jeweler she knows well, Mr. Hoffsteddar (Ed Wynn), and she calls the FBI through her pseudonym to persuade them through descriptions that the watch belonging to Miss Miller was indeed hard evidence after all, and after that, Supervisor Newton calls up Mr. Hoffsteddar himself to verify that the call wasn't a scam, who does agree and manage to let her pseudo call fool them into turning back on the case. By doing so, eventually, Patti and Kelso rescue Miss Miller and bring the robbers to justice. | Subplots involve a \"romance\" between Patti's sister Ingrid and Gregory Benson (Roddy McDowall) and a \"romance\" between Patti herself and a surf-obsessed slacker neighbor, Canoe Henderson (Tom Lowell) (which becomes dysfunctional when he comes to a misunderstanding thinking that she is dumping their relationship for another guy because of Kelso's car that he sees constantly parked outside her house), and the meddling of nosey neighbor Mrs. MacDougall (Elsa Lanchester) and her disapproving husband, Wilmer MacDougall (William Demarest). At the end, it is revealed that the gray cat in the opening sequence and D.C. have started a family. At the end, they are taking their kittens on a prowl.","m_cast":"Hayley Mills as Patricia \"Patti\" Randall | Dean Jones as FBI Agent Zeke Kelso | Dorothy Provine as Ingrid Randall | Roddy McDowall as Gregory Benson | Neville Brand as Dan | Frank Gorshin as Iggy | Elsa Lanchester as Mrs. MacDougall | William Demarest as Mr. Wilmer MacDougall | Tom Lowell as Canoe Henderson | Ed Wynn as Mr. Hofstedder the Jeweller | Richard Eastham as FBI Supervisor Mr. Newton | Liam Sullivan as Agent Graham | Grayson Hall as Ms. Margaret Miller | Iris Adrian as Mrs. Tabin the Landlady | Richard Deacon as the drive-in theater manager | Ben Lessy as Burton the drive-in concessionaire","m_reception":"Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \"The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb.
