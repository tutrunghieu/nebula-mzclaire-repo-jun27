For instance, at one point the plank is tied to the top of the car and projects backward into the open back of a large van. A man (played by Roy Castle) enters the back of the van and sits down. The van drives away, leaving him suspended in mid-air sitting on the end of the plank.","m_cast":"Eric Sykes | Tommy Cooper | Jimmy Edwards | Roy Castle | Jimmy Tarbuck | Anna Carteret | John Junkin | Bill Oddie as Window Cleaner | Stratford Johns as Station Sergeant | Graham Stark as Amorous Van Driver | Jim Dale as House Painter | Hattie Jacques | Rex Garner | Libby Morris | Ronnie Brody | Johnny Speight | Thomas Gallagher | Howard Douglas | Kenny Lynch | Joan Young | Barney Gilbraith | Clovissa Newcombe | Dermot Kelly | and The Cat | The plank itself was sold at auction in December 2011 for £1,050.[2][3][4]","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Eric Sykes","m_produced_by":"Jon Penington Beryl Vertue (executive)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Eric Sykes Tommy Cooper Jimmy Edwards","m_music_by":"Brian Fahey","m_cinematography":"Arthur Wooster","m_edited_by":"John Pomeroy","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"J.
