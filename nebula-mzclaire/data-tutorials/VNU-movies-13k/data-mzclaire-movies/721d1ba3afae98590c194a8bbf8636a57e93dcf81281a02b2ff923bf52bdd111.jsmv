{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Aurora, Illinois, two rock and roll enthusiasts in their 20s, Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar, host a cable access television show called Wayne's World, in which they lampoon eccentric locals and discuss topics of interest that include music and beautiful women; in spite of the show's low budget, it has proven quite popular in the Aurora area. One day, Benjamin Oliver, a television producer, discovers Wayne's World while visiting his girlfriend; after learning of the show's popularity, he has his assistant Russell Finley track down where Wayne's World is taped. | Wayne and Garth are offered $10,000 from Benjamin to purchase the rights to their show. Garth talks to the audience and admits his doubts on the shady deal, but he is too shy to say anything to Wayne, and the pair accept the offer. Using their newfound wealth, Wayne and Garth attend a local night club, where they avoid Wayne's psychotic ex-girlfriend Stacy, who repeatedly attempts to get back together with him, and Wayne sees Cassandra Wong, the lead vocalist and bassist of the band Crucial Taunt, who are playing on stage. He instantly becomes smitten with her and they both hit it off. In order to impress Cassandra, Wayne learns to speak Cantonese and the two share a conversation while Stacy, still following him, tries to make him jealous by being with another man, which ends up in disaster. He also purchases a guitar he had been eyeing for a long time. | Benjamin also becomes attracted to Cassandra, and uses his wealth and good looks to try to win her over. Giving Wayne and Garth a pair of tickets to an Alice Cooper concert to get them out of the way, he offers Cassandra a role in a music video. At the concert, Wayne and Garth meet the bodyguard (Chris Farley) of Frankie Sharpe, producer of Sharpe Records, and gain information which they could possibly use later. They are initially fazed when they go to their first recording of Wayne's World at a television studio, repeatedly implanting the film's product endorsements as Benjamin talks to them. When the show starts, they are required to speak with their big sponsor Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of arcades. True to form, Wayne violates Benjamin's rules by ridiculing Vanderhoff with a series of notes written on the back of his cards. Wayne is then called up to the booth and fired on the spot from his own show. Wayne leaves, and Garth, developing a case of stage fright, freezes up on camera. Following that, Wayne and Garth get into a heated argument, causing a rift in their friendship. Wayne also becomes jealous of Benjamin moving in on Cassandra and tries to prevent her from participating in the music video. Furious at Wayne for not trusting her, Cassandra breaks up with him. | Wayne makes up with Garth, and has a plan to get Cassandra back by getting Frankie Sharpe to hear her play. While Garth and their friends, with Russell's aid, gain access to a satellite station, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video set, where he embarrasses himself by trying to uncover Benjamin's ulterior motives and failing. As he leaves, a snake Benjamin is holding crawls along her neck and she suddenly suspects the same thing, Wayne apologizes to her and they return to Aurora, delaying Benjamin by having a police officer friend of Garth perform a rectal search on him. Broadcasting from Wayne's house, Wayne's World successfully hacks into Sharpe's satellite television and he listens to Cassandra play. As her song comes to an end, Sharpe and Benjamin converge in Wayne's basement; unfortunately, Sharpe, while impressed by Cassandra, is unable to sign her on, giving Benjamin a cruel satisfaction as Cassandra breaks up with Wayne again and leaves with Benjamin to a tropical resort. Meanwhile, Stacy admits she has been so moody because she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire starts amongst the camera equipment and burns the house down while Wayne carries Garth from the inferno. Unsatisfied with the \"bad ending\", they reenact the scene again, only this time they unmask Benjamin as \"Old Man Withers\" in a Scooby-Doo ending. They then reenact it again in a \"Mega Happy Ending\" where Cassandra is signed on to a record contract and gets back together with Wayne, Russell learns that \"platonic love can exist between two grown men\", Garth somehow starts a relationship with a \"dream woman\" who works at the local diner, and Benjamin discovers that \"money, great hair, and a perfect body can get you far in America; almost to the top, but it can't get you everything\" before they all break out in \"fish face\" and begin having fun.","m_cast":"Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell | Dana Carvey as Garth Algar | Tia Carrere as Cassandra Wong | Rob Lowe as Benjamin Oliver | Lara Flynn Boyle as Stacy, Wayne's crazy ex-girlfriend | Michael DeLuise as Alan, one of Wayne and Garth's crew | Lee Tergesen as Terry, Wayne and Garth's head cameraman | Dan Bell as Neil, Wayne's and Garth's other crewman | Sean Gregory Sullivan as Phil, Wayne and Garth's perpetually wasted friend who works at an auto repair shop | Brian Doyle-Murray as Noah Vanderhoff, a video arcade magnate | Colleen Camp as Mrs. Vanderhoff | Kurt Fuller as Russell Finley, Benjamin's assistant | Chris Farley as the well-informed security guard at the back of Alice Cooper concert | Meat Loaf as Tiny, a doorman at the Gasworks | Frank DiLeo as rock promoter Frankie 'Mr. Big' Sharp | Ed O'Neill as Glen, the manager at Stan Mikita's Donuts | Mike Hagerty as Davey, a controller at the Cable 10 television station whom Benjamin and Russell ask for help, he later claims that he got laid off while at Stan Mikita's | Frederick Coffin as Officer Koharski | Donna Dixon as Garth's dream woman | Ione Skye as Elyse, Benjamin's girlfriend, who introduces him to Wayne's World | Robin Ruzan as a waitress at Stan Makita's | Charles Noland as Ron Paxton, who tries to market his invention, the \"Suck-Kut\", to Garth | Carmen Filpi as Old Man Withers | Robert Patrick as Bad Cop, a parody of his T-1000 character in Terminator 2: Judgment Day | Alice Cooper with Pete Friesen, Derek Sherinian, Stef Burns,[5] and Jimmy DeGrasso as themselves.","m_reception":"Wayne's World received mostly positive reviews from critics.
