{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film starts with a parody of the 1981 Indiana Jones action film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Afterwards, the babies are chased out of the temple by a boulder, which is revealed to be Didi Pickles who is at the baby shower at the Pickles' house, where Didi is pregnant with a second baby, which everyone believes will be a girl. Didi goes into labor during the party and her friends rush her to the hospital. While this is happening, the kids crawl off. When the baby is finally born after a montage of past lives, it is actually a boy and they name him Dylan (but \"Dil\" for short), after Didi's cousin. | Dil quickly becomes a very spoiled baby, crying non-stop for attention, keeping all of the babies' toys for himself and refusing to share with Tommy. After a particularly nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommy's teddy bear, Stu has a conversation with Tommy about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has and assures him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside which he calls his \"sponsitility\", his term for responsibility. | When Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the \"hopsicle\" (a mispronunciation of hospital) despite Tommy's disapproval and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a Reptar Wagon Stu had built for a contest. Along the way, Dil had secretly stolen Angelica's Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take Spike and they embark on a quest to find the babies. | The babies eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. They spot a ranger's cabin where they believe a \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of wizard) lives, and decide to go there, believing that it can take them home. After an encounter with runaway circus monkeys, Dil is taken away by the monkeys. Tommy vows to find Dil by himself, because Chuckie, Phil, and Lil agree they are better off without him. Tommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the blanket for himself. And when the two boys are locked in a tug of war over it, the blanket rips in half and knocks Tommy into a mud puddle which Dil then laughs at. Tommy finally snaps and very nearly abandons Dil, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder frighten Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways and turns over a new leaf. They reconcile and sleep peacefully, beginning their bond as brothers. | After the storm, Tommy and the other babies reconcile, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the \"lizard.\" While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys but are then scared off by a wolf, who has been hunting down the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge to their apparent deaths. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via aircraft finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. | Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who has actually survived the fall. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys are reunited with their circus owners. In the final scene, the babies are having the same imaginary adventure they had when the movie began, but this time are successful with Dil's help, finally accepting him as one of them.","m_cast":"E.G.
