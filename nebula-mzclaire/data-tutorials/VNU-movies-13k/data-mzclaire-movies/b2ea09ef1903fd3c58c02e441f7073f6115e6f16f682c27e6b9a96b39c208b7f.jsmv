Funding was difficult to raise but eventually was done through the Australian Film Commission and Queensland Film Corporation.[4] | The film was nominated for seven AFI Awards and won for the Best Adapted Screenplay (Bruce Beresford, Rhoisin Beresford). It was also entered into the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.[5] Some Aboriginal activists walked out of the screening at Cannes.[4] | The Fringe Dwellers grossed $174,433 at the box office in Australia.[6]","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Nene Gare, The Fringe Dwellers, Sun Books, Melbourne, 1966 (first published by Heinemann, London, 1961). | ^ Geoff Gardner, \"The Fringe Dwellers\", Australian Film 1978-1992, Oxford Uni Press, 1993 p197 | ^ Australianscreen - info | ^ a b David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p202-204 | ^ \"Festival de Cannes: The Fringe Dwellers\". festival-cannes.com.
