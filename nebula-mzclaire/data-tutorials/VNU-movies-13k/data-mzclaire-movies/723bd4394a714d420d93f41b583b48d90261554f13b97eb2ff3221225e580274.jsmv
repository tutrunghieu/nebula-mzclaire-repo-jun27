{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"One afternoon in San Francisco, Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) purchases fake IDs at an apartment before returning home to feed her dog. She then goes to work and opens a box of film reels, including one that explains her life. She was born on January 1, 1908, later married and gave birth to a daughter, only to become a widow after her husband died in a tragic accident. Years later, in 1937, Adaline crashed her car when she swerved into a ravine during a freak snowstorm and died in the freezing lake nearby, but a lightning strike suddenly revived her. From that moment, she was unable to age and has remained twenty-nine for many decades. Ever since, she has changed her identification and address according to the era while her daughter Flemming (Ellen Burstyn) grows older than her mother. One night, two suspicious FBI agents attempt to force her onto an airplane for study, but she escapes captivity and realizes that she will have to spend the rest of her life on the run. | On New Year's Eve in the present year, she attends a party where she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), introducing herself as Jennifer. He asks to see her again but she refuses, knowing she can never fall in love because she can never have a natural future with someone. The next day at work, Ellis arrives and again asks Adaline to go on a date with him. Finally she accepts and after a second date they spend the night together. In a flashback, Adaline is shown pulling up in a cab to a park where a man is waiting, holding an engagement ring. Scared, she asks the cab driver to keep going. Back in the present day, Adaline begins to ignore Ellis' calls. He shows up at her apartment but she pushes him away, only to have a change of heart while looking through some old photographs and realizing she doesn't want to live the same year a hundred times without having a natural life. | They later resolve their argument and Ellis asks Adaline to attend the party at his parents' house celebrating his parents' fortieth anniversary, and she says yes. Upon their arrival, Ellis introduces her to his father, William (Harrison Ford), who recognizes her instantly and calls her Adaline. She appears to recognize him, too, but lies, telling him that Adaline was her mother, who has since passed away. A flashback shows how they met and came to be in love, soon revealing that he was the man with the engagement ring she stood up that one afternoon. One night, Ellis tells Adaline he is falling in love with her and she is unsure of how to react. | The following day, Adaline talks with William outside and he notices a scar on her left hand, and becomes shaken. Another flashback reveals that Adaline cut her hand while they were hiking decades ago and he had stitched it up himself. He realizes that she is truly Adaline and confronts her. She becomes upset, claiming she used to be \"normal\" and doesn't know what changed her. He begs her not to run, for Ellis' sake, but she says she doesn't know how to stay. She flees and returns to their house, writes a note to Ellis while he showers; she packs her things and leaves. Moments later, Ellis finds the letter and confronts his father, who refuses to explain. | While driving home, Adaline thinks of all the times she has run and suddenly has a change of heart about the way she lives her life. She stops and calls her daughter to tell her she is going to stop running. As she turns the car around, a tow truck plows into her in a hit-and-run accident, leaving her to die. Freezing and helpless, Adaline dies again. An ambulance arrives and she is revived by the electricity of the defibrillator. Later in the hospital, she wakes up to Ellis, and the two profess their love for one another. Adaline then tells him of her 107 years of life. | One year later, Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Year's Eve party. As she is leaving, she notices something strange in the hallway mirror: her first grey hair, proving she has begun to age naturally again.","m_cast":"Blake Lively as Adaline Bowman[4] / Jenny Larson | Michiel Huisman as Ellis Jones[5] | Harrison Ford as William Jones[6] Anthony Ingruber as young William | Ellen Burstyn as Flemming Prescott[4] | Kathy Baker as Kathy Jones | Amanda Crew as Kikki Jones | Lynda Boyd as Regan | Anjali Jay as Cora | Richard Harmon as Tony | Mark Ghanimé as Caleb | Barclay Hope as Stanley Chesterfield | Chris William Martin as Dale Davenport | Lane Edwards as Dr. Larry Levyne | Peter J.
