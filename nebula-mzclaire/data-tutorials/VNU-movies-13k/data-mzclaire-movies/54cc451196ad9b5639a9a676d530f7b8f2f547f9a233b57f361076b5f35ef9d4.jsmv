{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1975 Spain, a young girl named Laura is given up for adoption. Years later, adult Laura (Rueda) returns to the closed orphanage, accompanied by her husband, Carlos (Cayo), and their seven-year-old adopted son, Simón (Príncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. Simón claims to see a boy named Tomás (Óscar Casas). He befriends Tomás and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) informs Laura that Simón's adoption file indicates that Simón is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, Simón teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to Simón's adoption file. Simón becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. | During a party at the orphanage, Laura and Simón argue, and Simón hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that Simón is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón. | Six months later, Simón is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car. The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named Tomás who was interned there. The children stole a mask that Tomás wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, Tomás hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned. His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted. | Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) in the search for Simón. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for help. Laura discovers the remains of the orphans she grew up with in the orphanage. They were killed by Tomás' mother Benigna who wanted revenge on the children that were not blamed for the death of her son. She stored their remains in the orphanage's coal shed.[3] Unable to cope with the situation, Carlos leaves the orphanage. | Laura recreates the original orphanage layout and attempts to contact the children's spirits by playing a version of Peek Behind the Curtain. The spirits lead her to the door of a hidden underground room. Inside is Simón's corpse, wearing Tomás's mask. Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking the entrance to the secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck. | Laura takes an overdose of sleeping pills. Dying, she begs to be with Simón again and the children's spirits appear, with Simón among them. Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay and take care of the orphans. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and he smiles.","m_cast":"Belén Rueda as Laura, the wife of Carlos and mother of the adopted Simón.

The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics had given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168.[32] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews.[33] Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be \"deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills\".[34] Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, \"Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed in the context of Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not).\"[35] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, \"The year's best horror picture is also one of the simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors.\"[36] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying \"Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do\".[35] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, \"Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment. When she looks one way and then the other, while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home, every nerve-wracking whatwasthat? registers, and how. Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not.\"[37] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating, \"The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda.\"[38] | A negative review came from Lacey of The Globe and Mail, who felt that at \"[the film's] core, it seems intended as a sympathetic drama of a bereaved mother, who may have slipped into madness. What's even more disquieting is the persistent undercurrent of exploitation – the mixture of grief and jarring shock effects and the pitiless use of a disfigured child as a source of horror.\"[38] A.O. Scott of The New York Times claimed the film to be a \"diverting, overwrought ghost story\" and that it \"relies on basic and durable horror movie techniques\".[32] Jack Matthews of New York Daily News found the ending of the film to be one of the worst of the season, but praised the acting of Belén Rueda.[39] | The Orphanage listed as one of the top 10 best films of 2007 by several critics, including Lawrence Toppman of the Charlotte Observer, Marc Doyle of Metacritic and Tasha Robinson of The AV Club.[40] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker included the film on his top ten list of 2008.[41] In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.[42] The Orphanage placed at number 76 on their top 100 list.[43]","m_production":"The first draft of the script of The Orphanage was written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996.[6] Sánchez was not sure why he chose to write a genre film for the screenplay, as he explains, \"I ended up writing a film in the style of those I liked as a kid, movies like Poltergeist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby which I ruined on the first VCR we owned at home.\"[7] Sánchez revealed the literary influences underlying his writing of the script, such as The Turn of the Screw and Peter Pan.[8] Sánchez originally wanted to direct the script but he was repeatedly turned down by various Spanish production companies.[8] While Sánchez was working on the short film 7337 in 2004, he met with director Juan Antonio Bayona and offered him the script to direct.[7][8][9] Bayona accepted the opportunity because he felt that a fantasy themed script like that of The Orphanage would allow him freedom as a director, saying the fantasy genre was a great tool for learning as it \"allows manipulation of space and time as we wish or the use of certain camera moves with an immediate efficiency\".[10] | Bayona cut parts of the script, including the outcome of the other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her.[10] To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time.[11] To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993).[11] Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about it.[11] For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.[12] | During casting discussions between Bayona and del Toro, Bayona expressed a desire to see Belén Rueda in the lead.[11] Bayona admired her after seeing her performance as Julia in Alejandro Amenabar's The Sea Inside.[13] Del Toro appreciated this choice, as he admired her as an actress and liked that Bayona was casting her against type.[11] Bayona asked Rueda to watch The Innocents and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to prepare for the role.[14] Another actress Bayona desired for the film was Geraldine Chaplin in the role of Aurora, the medium.[11] Bayona stated that he wanted the film to have \"the mood of 70s Spanish cinema and Geraldine starred in one of the best movies of that decade, Carlos Saura's The Secret of Anna, as the ghost of the mother. It made sense to have her play the medium.\"[13] Bayona was nervous about filming with Chaplin. To break that tension, on the first day of shooting with her Bayona hid under a bed during a scene which required Chaplin to portray Anna kneeling down near it in the dark, and he grabbed Chaplin's leg when she did so.[13] Anna's scream in the film is Chaplin's actual frightened scream as Bayona grabbed her.[13] Roger Príncep's test-screening was one of the first for the role of Simón.[9] Bayona test-screened over four-hundred children during two months before making his choice to cast Princep.[9] Edgar Vivar was cast in role of Balabán; Bayona knew him through his work on the Mexican television series El Chavo and sent him an invitation for the role through e-mail.[15] | Production on The Orphanage began on May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias.[11] This location was chosen due to the area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place.[11] The orphanage was an old colonial house from the end of the nineteenth century.[11] Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages.[11] After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there.[11] Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.[3]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"J.

A. Bayona. The film stars Belén Rueda as Laura, Fernando Cayo as her husband, Carlos, and Roger Príncep as their adopted son Simón. The plot centers on Laura, who returns to her childhood home, an orphanage. Laura plans to turn the house into a home for disabled children, but after an argument with Laura, Simón is found to be missing. | The film's script was written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996 and brought to the attention of Bayona in 2004. Bayona asked his long-time friend, director Guillermo del Toro, to help produce the film and to double its budget and filming time. Bayona wanted the film to capture the feel of 1970s Spanish cinema; he cast Geraldine Chaplin and Belén Rueda, who were later praised for their roles in the film. | The film opened at the Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2007. It received critical acclaim from audiences in its native Spain, winning seven Goya awards. On its North American release, The Orphanage was praised by English-speaking critics, who described the film as well directed and well acted, and noted the film's lack of \"cheap scares\"; subsequently, New Line Cinema bought the rights to the film for an American remake. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/orfanato/news/1702016/ja_bayona_and_sergio_sanchez_on_the_orphanage_the_rt_interview/ | ^ a b \"The Orphanage (2007)\".
