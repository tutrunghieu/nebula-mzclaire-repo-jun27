{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Dignified but impoverished aristocrat Prince Amerigo, whose illustrious Italian family occupies the decaying Palazzo Ugolini in Florence, is engaged to American socialite Maggie Verver. She shares an extremely close relationship with her millionaire father Adam, a retired widowed tycoon living in England who intends to finance the construction of a museum to house his invaluable collection of art and antiquities in an American city. | Prior to their engagement, and unbeknownst to his fiancée, Amerigo had a long and passionate affair with Charlotte Stant, who attended school with Maggie. The two separated because of his lack of funds, but Charlotte is still in love with him. When she receives an invitation to the wedding, she seizes the opportunity to reunite with him, which she does at a party thrown by Maggie's aunt, Fanny. | A few days before the ceremony, Amerigo and Charlotte wander into an antique store in search of a wedding gift from her to the couple. Proprietor A.R. Jarvis shows them an ancient bowl, carved from a single piece of rock crystal and embroidered with gold, he asserts is flawless. Charlotte is indecisive about buying it, and Jarvis offers to set it aside until she can make up her mind. | Despite knowing Amerigo and Charlotte's history, Maggie's meddlesome Aunt Fanny suggests the young woman and Adam would be a perfect match. The two eventually wed, much to the delight of Maggie, who had been concerned about her father's loneliness. The two couples find their lives closely interlocked, although the fact Maggie and Adam spend so much time together irritates their spouses, and when they find themselves at a weekend party in the country without their mates, Charlotte and Amerigo rekindle their affair. Fanny becomes aware of the illicit romance but, wanting to protect her niece from being hurt, says nothing. As time passes, however, Maggie becomes suspicious of the amount of time her husband and stepmother spend together. | In search of an unusual gift for her father, who seemingly has everything, Maggie chances to wander into Jarvis' shop, and he shows her the bowl he had set aside for Charlotte years ago. Maggie agrees to buy it for £300 and asks that it be delivered to her home. When Jarvis discovers a barely discernible crack in the piece, he decides to bring it to Maggie himself, reveal the defect, and offer it to her for £150 instead. While waiting for her in the drawing room, he recognizes Amerigo and Charlotte in photographs on a table, and he innocently reveals they were the couple who originally considered purchasing the bowl, three days before the wedding, which Maggie always has believed was the first time her husband and friend met. The object suddenly becomes a symbol of adultery rather than a beautiful work of art, and Fanny intentionally drops it on the floor, hoping her niece will dispose of the pieces. | Maggie is not willing to forget what it represents, and as everyone avoids publicly discussing what each one of them privately knows, she sets to work, gently pushing her father and Charlotte closer together while finding ways of engaging with Amerigo. With Fanny's assistance, she is successful in convincing Adam to accelerate his plans and leave for the American city much earlier than planned. Charlotte, loathing the idea, resists and begins making a fool of herself in private and in public, but Amerigo gains a new respect for Maggie and allows himself to be led away from Charlotte. Against Amerigo and Fanny's advice, Maggie makes a final attempt to reconcile with Charlotte on the eve of her departure, but Charlotte haughtily rebuffs her and continues to deny the truth behind recent events. As Maggie and Amerigo settle into their marriage at last, a newsreel shows Adam and an over-dressed Charlotte adapting to their new life in \"American City\".","m_cast":"Kate Beckinsale as Maggie Verver | James Fox as Colonel Bob Assingham | Anjelica Huston as Fanny Assingham | Nick Nolte as Adam Verver | Jeremy Northam as Prince Amerigo | Madeleine Potter as Lady Castledean | Uma Thurman as Charlotte Stant | Nicholas Day as Lord Castledean | Peter Eyre as A.R.
