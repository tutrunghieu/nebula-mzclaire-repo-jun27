At first the different nationalities try to initiate their own plans until the senior British officer steps in and suggests co-operation between the different contingents. At first, the coordination fails because one of the prisoners is supplying information to the German guards. After he is discovered, plans remain secret and there follows a number of escapes; some successful, some not. | The prisoners of Colditz are high-spirited and eager to needle the Germans. The escape officer of the British contingent, Patrick Reid (Mills), assists in the escape of other prisoners and finally carries out his own escape. The culmination of his escape, his successful crossing into Switzerland, is not depicted in the film however.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film was the fourth most popular movie at the British box office in 1955.[2] It made a profit of £100,000 for its producer.[3] | A BBC television series, Colditz, also based on Reid's book and crediting this film followed during 1972–74, and starred David McCallum, Robert Wagner, Jack Hedley and Edward Hardwicke.","m_production":"The revue at the end of the film involves a parody of the song I Belong to Glasgow, and the routine of Flanagan and Allen (including Underneath the Arches).","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Colditz Story by Pat Reid","m_directed_by":"Guy Hamilton","m_produced_by":"Ivan Foxwell","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Mills Eric Portman Christopher Rhodes Ian Carmichael Lionel Jeffries","m_music_by":"Francis Chagrin","m_cinematography":"Gordon Dines","m_edited_by":"Peter Mayhew","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"British Lion Films","m_release_dates":"25 January 1955 (1955-01-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"93 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"₤136,000.[1] | The Colditz Story is a 1955 prisoner of war film starring John Mills and Eric Portman and directed by Guy Hamilton. | It is based on the book written by Pat Reid, a British army officer who was imprisoned in Oflag IV-C, Colditz Castle, in Germany during the Second World War and who was the Escape Officer for British POWs within the castle. |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ STEPHEN W. \"Noted on the British Movie Scene.\" New York Times 26 Apr 1959: X7 | ^ \"'The Dam Busters'.\" Times [London, England] 29 Dec. 1955: 12.
