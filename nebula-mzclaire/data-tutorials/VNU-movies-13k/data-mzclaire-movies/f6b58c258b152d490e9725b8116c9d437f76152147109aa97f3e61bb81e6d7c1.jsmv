{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"30-something Kassie Larson (Jennifer Aniston) is single, hasn't found love yet, and decides she wants to have a baby. Despite the objections of her neurotic long-time best friend Wally Mars (Jason Bateman), she chooses to do so alone because she can't wait any longer. She also wants a face-to-face sperm donor, disdaining using a sperm bank. Wally suggests he be the donor, but Kassie sees him as a bit too neurotic, pessimistic, and self-absorbed, and besides, as best friends, \"that would be weird.\" Wally has always had feelings for Kassie, and they dated six years ago, but his friend Leonard (Jeff Goldblum) points out he missed his chance when she put him in the \"friend zone\". | Kassie selects as sperm donor a handsome and charming (and married) assistant professor, Roland (Patrick Wilson). Kassie organizes an \"insemination party\", where Wally meets Roland and takes an instant dislike to him. Roland is then called upon and produces his sperm in the bathroom, leaving it in a sample cup. Wally uses the bathroom and sees the sample. Drunk and doped up after taking a pill provided him at the party by Kassie's friend, Debbie (Juliette Lewis), and not liking the idea of Kassie being inseminated with this sperm, Wally plays with the cup and accidentally spills it into the sink. Panicking, he replaces the sperm with his own. The next day at work, still hungover, he remembers nothing. The insemination is successful. Wally is then upset when Kassie tells him she is returning to her family home in Minnesota, as she thinks that would be a better environment to raise a child in, instead of New York City. She leaves, and Wally maintains a non-fulfilling, dreary existence. | Seven years later, Kassie returns to New York along with precocious-but-neurotic son Sebastian (Bryce Robinson). She wants to reconnect with Wally, and is eager to introduce her son to him. After an awkward first meeting, Wally eventually forms a bond with this loveable and seemingly mini-version of himself, and Sebastian starts to become close to Wally, but the bad news is that Roland is in the picture too: Kassie has started dating him because he is now divorced and, as she thinks he is Sebastian's father, and a nice guy, maybe it would work. | After Wally notices the similarities between himself and Sebastian, and after talking to his friend Leonard, Wally realizes what happened seven years earlier. Just before Roland proposes to Kassie, Wally reveals to Kassie that Sebastian is his son, along with his true feelings for her. She is shocked and angry and does not want to see him again. Some time passes, and one day, as he is leaving work, Wally finds Kassie waiting for him on the street outside his office building. She tells him Sebastian really misses him and needs him. Wally admits he misses and needs Sebastian too. Kassie then discloses she isn't with Roland any longer, and that she loves him, even with all of his idiosyncrasies. Wally proposes to her, Kassie accepts, and they kiss. The final scene shows a happily married Wally and Kassie throwing Sebastian's eighth birthday party.","m_cast":"Jennifer Aniston as Kassie Larson | Jason Bateman as Wally Mars | Thomas Robinson as Sebastian Larson | Patrick Wilson as Roland | Juliette Lewis as Debbie Epstein | Jeff Goldblum as Leonard | Caroline Dhavernas as Pauline | Scott Elrod as Declan | Bryce Robinson as older Sebastian Larson | Diane Sawyer as herself (cameo) | Victor Pagen as a guy with border line Tourette syndrome","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Aniston revealed in the DVD 'extras' that she had known Bateman since she was 25, and the producers and directors noted their good chemistry in working together.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Baster 1996 in The New Yorker  by Jeffrey Eugenides","m_directed_by":"Josh Gordon & Will Speck","m_produced_by":"Jennifer Aniston | Nathan Kahane | Kristin Hahn | Albert Berger | Ron Yerxa | Brian Bell","m_screenplay_by":"Allan Loeb","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jennifer Aniston | Jason Bateman | Patrick Wilson | Juliette Lewis | Jeff Goldblum","m_music_by":"Alex Wurman","m_cinematography":"Jess Hall","m_edited_by":"John Axelrad","m_production_company":"Mandate Pictures Echo Films","m_distributed_by":"Miramax Films (theatrical)","m_release_dates":"August 19, 2010 (2010-08-19) (Israel, Russia) | August 20, 2010 (2010-08-20) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"101 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$19 million[1]","m_box_office":"$49.9 million[2] | The Switch is a 2010 American romantic comedy film, directed by Josh Gordon & Will Speck.
