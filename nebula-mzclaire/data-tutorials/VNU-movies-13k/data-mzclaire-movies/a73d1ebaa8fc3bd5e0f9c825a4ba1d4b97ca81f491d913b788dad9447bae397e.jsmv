{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Rick Riker (Drake Bell) is an unpopular student at Empire High School. He lives with his Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielsen) and Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross), and his best friend, Trey (Kevin Hart), is also his confident. Rick has a crush on Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), but she is dating bully Lance Landers (Ryan Hansen). One day, Rick and his class go on a school field trip at an animal research lab that is run by terminally ill businessman Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald), who is Lance's uncle. During the trip, Rick accidentally saturates himself in animal-attraction liquid, which causes a group of animals to hump him. This also leads a chemically enhanced radioactive dragonfly to fly onto Rick's neck and bite him. | Meanwhile, Lou creates a machine designed to heal illness; testing it on himself, he gains perfect health at the cost of needing to drain life energy from a victim per day. To avoid arrest for murder, Lou becomes the villain \"Hourglass.\" During a science fair, Rick begins to experience strange physical traits which creates a number of mishaps, and later realizes he has developed superpowers from the dragonfly bite. Rick reveals his secret to his uncle and Trey, and an argument starts between him and Albert. The next day, while visiting the bank with his aunt, Rick accidentally allows a bank robber to make off with stolen cash. The robber shoots Albert, landing him in the hospital. Rick is later met by Xavier (Tracy Morgan), who takes Rick to his school for mutants, where he meets Storm, Wolverine, Cyclops, the Invisible Woman and Mrs. Xavier, who convince Rick to become a superhero. At home, Rick creates a superhero costume and dubs himself \"Dragonfly\". As Dragonfly, Rick starts watching over the city and fighting crime, quickly becoming a media sensation, despite being unable to fly. Later, Dragonfly attempts to stop Hourglass from robbing a warehouse full of \"ceryllium\" as part of his evil plan but fails, leaving himself injured and allowing Hourglass to escape. | Later that night, Jill is attacked by thieves, but Dragonfly saves her and they share a kiss. Meanwhile, Landers plans to construct a machine that will kill people and give him enough life energy to make him immortal. Later that night, Landers and Lance have dinner with Rick's family and Jill, but Landers secretly learns of Rick's true identity when he notices the same injuries on Rick as on Dragonfly. Making up an awkward excuse, he and Lance leave. Landers returns minutes later as Hourglass and ends up killing Aunt Lucille. Albert awakens from his coma, learning about her death indirectly from his moronic doctor. After a comic funeral, Jill meets Rick and offers to begin a relationship with him. However, Rick fears Hourglass will come for Jill if they were together, and therefore rejects Jill, leaving her hurt and furious. | Rick decides to end his superhero career once and for all, but knowing that Hourglass would head to an awards ceremony to kill hundreds of people, he gets Albert to take him there. At the ceremony, Jill discovers that Landers is Hourglass. When Hourglass clashes with Dragonfly on a rooftop, he tries to activate his machine, but Dragonfly manages to kill him with a bomb that had been comically stuck onto his genitals after being thrown by Hourglass. Jill is thrown off the side of the building by the explosion, but Dragonfly finally manages to grow wings and save her. Jill learns Rick is Dragonfly due to a family ring he wears being exposed through a hole in his glove, and the two finally begin a relationship. After being thanked for saving the city, Rick flies away with Jill, but the two are unexpectedly rammed by a passing helicopter.","m_cast":"Drake Bell as Rick Riker/Dragonfly | Sara Paxton as Jill Johnson | Christopher McDonald as Lou Landers/Hourglass | Leslie Nielsen as Uncle Albert | Kevin Hart as Trey | Marion Ross as Aunt Lucille | Ryan Hansen as Lance Landers | Robert Joy as Stephen Hawking | Brent Spiner as Dr. Strom | Jeffrey Tambor as Dr. Whitby | Tracy Morgan as Professor Xavier | Regina Hall as Mrs. Xavier | Pamela Anderson as the Invisible Girl | Simon Rex as Human Torch | Craig Bierko as Wolverine | Robert Hays as Blaine Riker | Nicole Sullivan as Julia Riker | Sam Cohen as Young Rick Riker | Dan Castellaneta as Carlson | Keith David as Chief Karlin | Marisa Lauren as Storm | Miles Fisher as Tom Cruise | Charlene Tilton as Mrs. Johnson | Sean Simms as Barry Bonds | Freddie Pierce as Tony Bennett | Howard Mungo as Nelson Mandela | Lil' Kim as Xavier's daughter | Cameron Ali Sims as Xavier's son | Marque Richardson as Xavier's oldest son (uncredited) | Kurt Fuller as Mr. Thompson","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The film was initially slated for theatrical release on February 9, 2007 as Superhero! under the direction of David Zucker.[2] However, it was delayed, and the film later began production on September 17, 2007 in New York, and the director's chair was shifted to Craig Mazin, with Zucker being pushed back to being a producer.[3][4] Though the film was produced in New York, the flyover scenes used as transitions in the film use footage of the business district in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. | Zucker said the film primarily parodied Spider-Man, but it also spoofed Batman Begins, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Superman.
