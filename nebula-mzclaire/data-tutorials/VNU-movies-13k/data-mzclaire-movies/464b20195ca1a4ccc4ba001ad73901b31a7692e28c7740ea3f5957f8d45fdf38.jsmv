It was designed as a vehicle for Harry Secombe and was shot near Parkes in New South Wales from January 1972. The budget mostly came from United States and British sources, with $100,000 from the Australian Film Development Corporation.[1][4] | The pupils seen acting at choir practice in the early part of the film were from Afon Taf High School in Troedyrhiw. The choir recorded the entire choral soundtrack at the school and it was used in both the Welsh and Australian sequences. The beginning of the film used locations in two Welsh mining villages; Treharris and Trelewis near Merthyr Tydfil. The name of the school is Webster Street School, Treharris which has since been demolished for housing.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"James Gilbert","m_produced_by":"Jack Neary James Grafton","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Harry Secombe","m_music_by":"Peter Knight","m_cinematography":"Brian West","m_edited_by":"Anthony Buckley Barry Peters","m_production_company":"Immigrant Productions","m_distributed_by":"British Empire Films","m_release_dates":"18 November 1972","m_running_time":"92 mins","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English","m_budget":"A$400,000[1] | Sunstruck is a 1972 British-Australian comedy film directed by James Gilbert and starring Harry Secombe, Maggie Fitzgibbon and John Meillon.[2] |  | ","m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998 p267 | ^ http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/52819 | ^ Readle p.184 | ^ \"FEATURES WRITERS' WORLD BOOKS Dusty bush setting for former Goon's film.\".
