{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is a young boy growing up in Paris during the early 1950s. Misunderstood at home by his parents and tormented in school by his insensitive teacher (Guy Decomble), Antoine frequently runs away from both places. The boy finally quits school after being caught plagiarizing Balzac by his teacher. He steals a typewriter from his stepfather's (Albert Remy) work place to finance his plans to leave home, but is apprehended while trying to return it. | The stepfather angrily turns Antoine over to the police and Antoine spends the night in jail, sharing a cell with prostitutes and thieves. During an interview with the judge, Antoine’s mother confesses that her husband is not Antoine’s biological father. Antoine is placed in an observation center for troubled youths near the shore (as per his mother's wishes). A psychologist at the center probes reasons for Antoine's unhappiness, which the youth reveals in a fragmented series of monologues. | One day, while playing football with the other boys, Antoine escapes under a fence and runs away to the ocean, a place he has wanted to visit his entire life. He reaches the shoreline of the sea and runs into it. The film concludes with a freeze-frame of Antoine, and the camera optically zooms in on his face, looking into the camera.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"\"A seminal French New Wave film that offers an honest, sympathetic, and wholly heartbreaking observation of adolescence without trite nostalgia.\" | The film was widely acclaimed, winning numerous awards, including the Best Director Award at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival,[7] the Critics Award of the 1959 New York Film Critics' Circle and the Best European Film Award at 1960's Bodil Awards. It was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 32nd Academy Awards. The film holds a very rare 100% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews.[6] | The film is among the top ten of the British Film Institute's list of 50 films that should be seen by age 14.","m_production":"The English title is a literal translation of the French but misses its meaning, as the French title refers to the idiom \"faire les quatre cents coups\", which means \"to raise hell\". On the first prints in the United States, subtitler and dubber Noelle Gilmore gave the film the title Wild Oats, but the distributor did not like that and reverted it to The 400 Blows. Before seeing it, some people thought the film covered the topic of corporal punishment.[5] | The semi-autobiographical film reflects events of Truffaut's and his friends' lives. In style, it expresses Truffaut's personal history of French film, with references to other works—most notably a scene borrowed wholesale from Jean Vigo's Zéro de conduite. Truffaut dedicated the film to the man who became his spiritual father, André Bazin, who died just as the film was about to be shot. | Besides being a character study, the film is an exposé of the injustices of the treatment of juvenile offenders in France at the time. | Avenue Frochot, Paris 9, Paris, France | Eiffel Tower, Champ de Mars, Paris 7, Paris, France | Honfleur, Calvados, France | Montmartre, Paris 18, Paris, France | Palais de Chaillot, Trocadéro, Paris 16, Paris, France | Pigalle, Paris 9, Paris, France | Rue Fontaine, Paris, France | Sacré Cœur, Paris 18, Paris, France","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"François Truffaut","m_produced_by":"François Truffaut | Georges Charlot[1]","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jean-Pierre Léaud | Albert Rémy | Claire Maurier","m_music_by":"Jean Constantin","m_cinematography":"Henri Decaë","m_edited_by":"Marie-Josèphe Yoyotte","m_production_company":"Les Films du Carrosse","m_distributed_by":"Cocinor","m_release_dates":"4 May 1959 (1959-05-04) (France) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"99 minutes","m_country":"France","m_language":"French","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$30.7 million[2] | The 400 Blows (French: Les Quatre Cents Coups) is a 1959 French drama film, the debut by director François Truffaut; it stars Jean-Pierre Léaud, Albert Rémy, and Claire Maurier.
