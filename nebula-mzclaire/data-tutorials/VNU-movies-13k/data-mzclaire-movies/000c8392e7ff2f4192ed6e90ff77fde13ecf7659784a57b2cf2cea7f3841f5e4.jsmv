{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2005, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons has culminated in the Decepticons conquering their home planet Cybertron, while the Autobots operate from its two moons preparing a counter-offensive. Optimus Prime sends an Autobot shuttle to Earth's Autobot City for Energon supplies, but the Decepticons, led by Megatron, commandeer the ship and kill the crew. Travelling to Earth, the Decepticons attack Autobot City, slaughtering many Autobots and leaving only a small group alive including Hot Rod, Kup, Ultra Magnus, Arcee, Springer, Blurr, Perceptor, Blaster, and the human Daniel Witwicky. The next day, Optimus and the Dinobots arrive as reinforcements. Optimus single-handedly defeats the Decepticons and engages Megatron in a climactic battle that leaves both of them mortally wounded. On his death bed, Optimus passes the Matrix of Leadership to Ultra Magnus, informing him that its power will light the Autobots' darkest hour, and dies. | Elsewhere, the Decepticons jettison their wounded from Astrotrain, including Megatron at the hands of his treacherous second-in-command Starscream. The wounded are found by Unicron, a gigantic sentient cyber-planet who consumes other planets. Unicron offers Megatron a new body in exchange for destroying the Matrix, which has the ability to destroy him. Megatron agrees and is converted into Galvatron, gaining new troops from the other Decepticons present. Going to Cybertron, Galvatron crashes Starscream's coronation as Decepticon commander and destroys him, before travelling to Autobot City to eliminate Ultra Magnus. The surviving Autobots escape in separate shuttles which are damaged by the Decepticons and crash land on different planets. | Hot Rod and Kup are taken prisoner by the Quintessons, multi-faced tyrants who hold kangaroo courts and execute prisoners by feeding them to the Sharkticons. Hot Rod and Kup learn of Unicron from Kranix, a survivor of Lithone – a planet devoured by Unicron. After Kranix is executed, Hot Rod and Kup try to escape their own trial, aided by the arrival of the Dinobots and the small Autobot Wheelie, who helps them find a ship to leave the planet. The other Autobots land on the Junk Planet, where Galvatron kills Ultra Magnus and seizes the Matrix, intending on using it to control Unicron. The Autobots reunite and befriend the local Junkions, led by Wreck-Gar, who then rebuild Magnus. Learning Galvatron has the Matrix, the Autobots and Junkions fly to Cybertron, which Unicron, discovered to be a gigantic Transformer also now in robot form, begins to destroy. | The Autobots crash their spaceship through Unicron's eye but are separated. Daniel rescues his father Spike and Jazz, Bumblebee, and Cliffjumper from being devoured. Hot Rod confronts Galvatron, who tries to form an alliance, but is forced into attacking Hot Rod by Unicron. Hot Rod obtains the Matrix, which converts him into Rodimus Prime, the Autobot that Optimus said would light their darkest hour. Rodimus tosses Galvatron into space and uses the Matrix's power to destroy Unicron from the inside. The Autobots celebrate the end of the war and the retaking of Cybertron, while Unicron's head begins to orbit the planet.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Transformers: The Movie received mixed reviews and currently has 53% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with 10 of 19 counted reviews giving it a \"rotten\" rating. The film has an average rating of 5 out of 10.[22] Caryn James of the New York Times described the film by stating, \"While all this action may captivate young children, the animation is not spectacular enough to dazzle adults, and the Transformers have few truly human elements to lure parents along, even when their voices are supplied by well-known actors.\"[4]","m_production":"The film was budgeted at $6 million, six times greater than the budget used to create 90 minutes of the regular cartoon series.[2] Nelson Shin's team of almost one hundred personnel normally took three months to make one episode of the series, so, despite the extra budget, faced considerable time constraints in making the film whilst also continuing production on the TV series at the same time.[2] According to Shin, the decisions on which characters to include or kill off were made by Hasbro. \"They created the story using characters that could best be merchandised for the film. Only with that consideration could I have freedom to change the storyline.\" Shin also came up with the concept of the Transformers changing color when they died: \"When Optimus Prime died, I changed his color from red and blue into grey to show the spirit was gone from his body.\"[2] | The Transformers: The Movie was the final film to which Orson Welles contributed.[7] Welles was in declining health during production. Shortly before he died, he told his biographer, Barbara Leaming, \"You know what I did this morning? I played the voice of a toy.\" He elaborated, \"I play a planet. I menace somebody called Something-or-other. Then I'm destroyed. My plan to destroy Whoever-it-is is thwarted and I tear myself apart on the screen.\"[8] According to director Nelson Shin, Welles had been pleased to accept the role after reading the script and had expressed an admiration for animated films.[2] Welles' voice was apparently so weak by the time he made his recording that technicians needed to run it through a synthesizer to salvage it. The voicework for The Transformers: The Movie was the last film project he worked on; his last voice session was on October 5, 1985, and five days later, Welles died of a heart attack.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Transformers  by Hasbro","m_directed_by":"Nelson Shin","m_produced_by":"Joe Bacal | Tom Griffith","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Victor Caroli","m_music_by":"Vince DiCola","m_cinematography":"Masatoshi Fukui","m_edited_by":"David Hankins","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"De Laurentiis Entertainment Group","m_release_dates":"August 8, 1986 (1986-08-08) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"85 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$6 million[2]","m_box_office":"$5.8 million (US)[3] | The Transformers: The Movie is a 1986 American animated science fiction action adventure film based on the animated TV series by the same name. It was released in North America on August 8, 1986 and in the UK on December 5, 1986.[4] | The film was co-produced and directed by Nelson Shin, who produced the original Transformers television series, and features the voices of Eric Idle, Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, Casey Kasem, Robert Stack, Lionel Stander, John Moschitta, Jr., Peter Cullen and Frank Welker. It also marked the final roles for both Orson Welles, who died the year before its release,[5] and Scatman Crothers, who died months after its release.[citation needed] | The story takes place in 2005, 20 years after the events of the TV series' second season and serves to bridge into the third season.[6] In the film, Megatron kills Optimus Prime and much of the cast of the television series and is reborn as Galvatron. He sides with a gigantic, planet-devouring Transformer called Unicron, and the remaining Autobots set out to defeat them. Set to a soundtrack of synth-based incidental music and hard-driving metal music, composed by Vince DiCola, the film has a decidedly darker tone than the television series, with detailed visuals in Toei Animation's typical anime film styling,[original research?] and like G.I. Joe: The Movie, Decepticon villains that are more menacing, killing without hesitation. The film features several grand battles in which a handful of major characters meet their end. The film's tagline was: \"Beyond good. Beyond evil. Beyond your wildest imagination.\" |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"TRANSFORMERS (U)\". British Board of Film Classification.
