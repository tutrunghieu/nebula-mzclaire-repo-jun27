{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Three film students, Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard, set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, formerly Blair, and interview locals about the legend of the Blair Witch. The locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods where he tortured and murdered them. Parr brought the children into his house's basement in pairs, forcing the first child to face the corner and listen to their companion's screams as he murdered the second child. Parr would then murder the first child. Eventually turning himself in to the police, Parr later pleaded insanity, saying that the spirit of Elly Kedward, a witch hanged in the 18th century, had been terrorizing him and promised to leave him alone if he murdered the children, but was hanged anyway. | The second day, the students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to look for evidence that the Blair Witch exists. Along the way, they meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted and recalls that in 1888, a young girl named Robin Weaver went missing, and when she returned three days later, she talked about \"an old woman whose feet never touched the ground.\" His companion is, however, skeptical of the Blair Witch legend. The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century, their bodies later disappearing, and then camp for the night. The next day they move deeper in despite being uncertain of their exact location on the map. They eventually locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small cairns. They set up camp nearby and then return to the cemetery after dark. Josh accidentally disturbs a cairn and Heather hastily repairs it. Later they hear crackling sounds in the darkness that seem to be coming from all directions, but assume the noises are from animals or locals. | The third day, they attempt to return to their vehicle but cannot find their way. That night, they again hear crackling noises but cannot see anything. The next morning (their fourth), they find three cairns have been built around their tent during the night. Heather realizes her map is missing, and Mike reveals he kicked it into a creek out of frustration the previous day. They realize they are now hopelessly lost and decide simply to \"head south\". They discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night they hear sounds of children and bizarre \"morphing\" sounds. When an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until dawn, starting their fifth day. Upon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with a peculiar translucent slime. Later, they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier despite having traveled directly south all day, seemingly going in circles. | The sixth morning, Heather and Mike awaken to find that Josh has disappeared. After trying in vain to find him, they slowly move on. That night, they hear Josh screaming in the darkness but are not able to find him. The seventh morning, Heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent. As she searches through it, she finds it to contain blood-soaked scraps of Josh's shirt, as well as teeth, hair, and possibly a tongue, but though thoroughly distraught by the discovery, she does not mention this to Mike. As night falls, Heather (in the film's infamous scene) films herself apologizing to the co-producers of her project as well as their families and breaks down crying and hyperventilates, understanding that something terrible is hunting her and Mike, and will eventually take them. Later that night, they again hear Josh's agonized cries for help, and discover a derelict, abandoned house in the woods, which contains runic symbols and children's handprints on the walls. Mike races upstairs, following what sounds like Josh's voice, while Heather tries to follow. Mike then states he hears Josh in the basement. He runs downstairs and after what seems to be a quick struggle, goes silent and drops the camera. Heather enters the basement, looking for both men, and her camera catches a glimpse of Mike facing the corner. Something unseen is heard hitting Heather, causing her to drop her camera violently to the floor, and the footage ends.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The Blair Witch Project was shown at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, and released by Artisan on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity, including a campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the movie was a record of real events. The distribution strategy for The Blair Witch Project was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg.[27][28] | The Blair Witch Project grossed $248,639,099 worldwide.[29] After reshoots, a new sound mix, experiments with different endings, and other changes made by the studio, the film's final budget ended up between $500,000 and $750,000.[18] | The movie has been widely acclaimed by critics. Rotten Tomatoes provides links to 155 reviews for the movie, with 86% of these reviews being favorable.[30] Also, the film holds a score of 81/100 on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[31] The film's \"found footage\" format received near-universal praise by critics and, though not the first in the found footage device, the film has been declared a milestone in film history due to its critical and box office success. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a total of 4 stars, calling it \"an extraordinarily effective horror film\".[32] It was listed on Filmcritic.com as the 50th best movie ending of all time.[33] | Film critic Michael Dodd has argued that the film is an embodiment of horror \"modernizing its ability to be all-encompassing in expressing the fears of American society\", acknowledging its status as the archetypal modern found footage feature, he noted that \"In an age where anyone can film whatever they like, horror neednâ€™t be a cinematic expression of what terrifies the cinema-goer, it can simply be the medium through which terrors captured by the average American can be showcased\".[34] During 2008, Entertainment Weekly named The Blair Witch Project one of \"the 100 best films from 1983 to 2008\", ranking it at #99.[35] In 2006, Chicago Film Critics Association listed it as one of the \"Top 100 Scariest Movies\", ranking it #12.[36] | Because the filming was done by the actors using hand-held cameras, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some audience members experienced motion sickness and even vomited as a result.[37] | The Blair Witch Project was nominated for, and won, the following awards.","m_production":"The Blair Witch Project was developed during 1993[5] by the filmmakers. Myrick and Sanchez came across the idea for the film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both.[6] The script began with a 35-page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised.[5] Accordingly, the directors advertised in Backstage magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities.[7] There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the pool of 2,000 actors.[8][9] In developing the mythology behind the movie, the filmmakers used many inspirations. Several character names are near-anagrams; Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic. Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, began as an anagram for Rasputin.[10] In talks with investors, they presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage.[11] This documentary, originally called The Blair Witch Project: The Story of Black Hills Disappearances was produced by Haxan Films. | Filming began in October 1997 and lasted eight days.[7][12] Most of the movie was filmed in Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County, Maryland, although a few scenes were filmed in the real town of Burkittsville.[13] Some of the townspeople interviewed in the film were not actors, and some were planted actors, unknown to the main cast. The final scenes were filmed at the historic Griggs House in Granite, Maryland. Donahue had never operated a camera before and spent two days in a \"crash course.\" Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she once worked with, citing the character's self assuredness when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis.[14] | According to Heather Donahue, auditions for the film were held at Musical Theater Works in New York City, and ads were placed in the weekly Backstage for an open audition.[15] The advertisement noted an \"entirely improvised feature film\" shot in a \"wooded location.\"[15] Donahue described the audition as Myrick and Sanchez posing her the question: \"You've served seven years of a nine year sentence. Why should we let you out on parole?\" to which Donahue was required to improvise a response.[15] | Joshua Leonard, also in response to audition calls through Back Stage, claimed he was cast in the film due to his knowledge of how to run a camera, as there was not an omniscient camera filming the scenes.[16] | During filming, the actors were given clues as to their next location through messages given in milk crates found with Global Positioning Satellite systems. They were given individual instructions that they would use to help improvise the action of the day.[7] Teeth were obtained from a Maryland dentist for use as human remains in the movie.[7] Influenced by producer Gregg Hale's memories of his military training, in which \"enemy soldiers\" would hunt a trainee through wild terrain for three days, the directors moved the characters far during the day, harassing them by night and depriving them of food.[11] | Almost 19 hours of usable footage was recorded which had to be edited down to 90 minutes.[9] The editing in post production took more than eight months. Originally it was hoped that the movie would make it on to cable television, and the filmmakers did not anticipate wide release.[5] The initial investment by the three filmmakers was about US$35,000. Artisan acquired the film for US$1.1 million but spent US$25 million to market it.[citation needed] The actors signed a \"small\" agreement to receive some of the profits from the film's release.[7] | A list of production budget figures have circulated over the years, appearing as low as $20,000. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, SÃ¡nchez revealed that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent.[17] Other figures list a final budget ranging between $500,000 and $750,000.[18]","m_sequel":"A sequel, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, was released in the autumn of 2000, but was poorly received by most critics.[49] A third installment announced that same year did not materialize.[50] Eduardo Sanchez has revealed that he is still planning Blair Witch 3 and that the film is \"inevitable,\" but added that there is nothing to officially announce as of now.[51] | An unofficial spin-off was released in 2011 titled Doc. 33', an Italian found footage horror film. The film starts by describing the events that occur in The Blair Witch Project; it then follows by describing a similar incident that occurred in Wirgen, Austria. The film revolves around a group of filmmakers in 1998 who investigate an orphanage in the woods where dozens of children were murdered by nuns. The nuns took part in occult practices which dubbed the Mother Superior of the orphanage \"the Witch of Wirgen woods.\"","m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Daniel Myrick | Eduardo SÃ¡nchez","m_produced_by":"Gregg Hale | Robin Cowie","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Heather Donahue | Michael C.

The film relates the fictional story of three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard) who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) was discovered a year later and that this \"recovered footage\" is the film the viewer is watching.[2] | The film received unexpected acclaim from critics and became a resounding box office successâ€“grossing over US$248 million worldwide,[3] making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time. The DVD was released on October 26, 1999 and in 2010 a Blu-ray edition was released. | A sequel was released on October 27, 2000 titled Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Another sequel was planned for the following year, but did not materialize. On September 2, 2009, it was announced that SÃ¡nchez and Myrick were pitching the third film.[4] A trilogy of video games based on the films was released in 2000. The Blair Witch franchise has since expanded to include various novels, dossiers, comic books and additional merchandise. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b \"The Blair Witch Project\".
