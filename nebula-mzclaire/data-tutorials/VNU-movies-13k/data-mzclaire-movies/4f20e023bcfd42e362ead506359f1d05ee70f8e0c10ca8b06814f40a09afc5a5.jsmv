{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Hook-handed Vietnam veteran Staff Sergeant John \"Four Leaf\" Tayback's (Nick Nolte) memoir, Tropic Thunder, is being made into a film. With the exception of newcomer supporting actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel), the cast—fading action hero Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), five-time Academy Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.), rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black)—behave unreasonably. Rookie director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) cannot control them during filming of a large battle scene, and production is reported to be one month behind schedule a mere week into production. Studio executive Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) orders Cockburn to resume filming as planned, or risk its cancellation. | Acting on Four Leaf's advice, Damien drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film \"guerrilla-style\". The actors have guns that fire blanks, along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unknown to the actors and production, the group have been dropped in the middle of the Golden Triangle, the home of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Just as the group are about to set off, Damien inadvertently steps on an old land mine and is blown up, stunning the actors. Tugg, believing Damien faked his death to encourage the cast to give better performances, persuades the others that Damien is alive and that they are still shooting the film. Lazarus is unconvinced but joins them in their trek through the jungle. | When Four Leaf and pyrotechnics operator Cody Underwood (Danny McBride) try to locate the dead director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon, at which point Four Leaf reveals that he fabricated his memoir, was never in the Army, and has hands. As the actors continue through the jungle, Kirk and Kevin discover that Tugg is leading them in the wrong direction. The four actors, tired of walking and hoping to be rescued, leave Tugg, who goes off by himself and is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their heroin factory, Tugg believes it is a POW camp from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the box office bomb Simple Jack, and forces him to reenact it several times a day. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Tugg's agent Rick 'Pecker' Peck (Matthew McConaughey) is trying to negotiate with Les an unfulfilled term in Tugg's contract that entitles him to a TiVo. Flaming Dragon calls the two and demands a ransom for Tugg, but Les instead berates the gang. Despite the threats, Les expresses no interest in rescuing Tugg and tries to convince Rick about the benefits of allowing Tugg to die and collecting the insurance. Les also offers Rick a Gulfstream V jet and money in return for his cooperation. | Kirk, Alpa, Jeff, and Kevin discover Flaming Dragon's heroin factory. After witnessing Tugg being tortured, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film's script. Kirk impersonates a farmer towing a captured Jeff on the back of a water buffalo, distracting the armed guards so Alpa and Kevin can locate the captives. After the gang's leader (Brandon Soo Hoo) notices inconsistencies in Kirk's story, the actors, knowing their cover has been blown, begin firing, temporarily subduing the gang. Their control of the gang falls apart when Jeff grabs the leader and heads for the drugs, and the gang regains their guns and begin firing. | The four actors locate Four Leaf, Cody, and Tugg and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to Underwood's helicopter. Tugg asks to remain behind with the gang which he considers his family, but quickly returns when Flaming Dragon fires in pursuit. Four Leaf detonates the bridge allowing Tugg to reach safety, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang fires a rocket-propelled grenade at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle carrying a TiVo box and throws it in the path of the grenade, saving them. The crew return to Hollywood, where footage from the hidden cameras is compiled into a feature film, Tropic Blunder, which becomes a major critical and commercial success. The film wins Tugg his first Academy Award, which Kirk presents to him at the ceremony. | In a mid-credits scene, Rick is on a plane back to Hollywood with his estranged son.","m_cast":"Ben Stiller as Tugg Speedman: Once the highest-paid, highest-grossing action film star ever due to his Scorcher franchise, his career has stalled, and he now has a reputation for appearing in nothing but box office bombs. After a failed attempt at portraying a serious role in Simple Jack, in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. The first faux trailer at the film's start is a preview for Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, the latest in his series. | Jack Black as Jeff Portnoy: A drug-addicted comedian-actor well known for portraying multiple parts in films that rely on toilet humor, particularly jokes about flatulence. In the film-within-a-film, he plays a raspy-voiced soldier named Fats. He fears he is only considered an actor because of his comical delivery and nothing else. Portnoy's faux trailer for The Fatties: Fart 2, about a family (with each member played by Portnoy) which enjoys passing gas, spoofs Eddie Murphy's portrayal of multiple characters in films such as Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.[3][4][5] | Robert Downey, Jr. as Kirk Lazarus: An immensely talented Australian method actor, Lazarus had a controversial \"pigmentation alteration\" surgery to darken his skin for his portrayal of the black character Staff Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Lazarus refuses to break character until he has recorded the DVD commentary for a part and only speaks in his character's African American Vernacular English. Lazarus's faux trailer, Satan's Alley, is about two gay monks in a 12th-century Irish monastery, parodying art house films like Brokeback Mountain and Downey's own scenes with Tobey Maguire (who in a cameo portrays the other monk) in Wonder Boys.[6] | Steve Coogan as Damien Cockburn: The inexperienced British film director who is unable to control the actors in the film. | Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky: A respectful novice actor, he is the only cast member to have read the script and book and attended the assigned boot camp prior to the film. Sandusky plays a young soldier named Brooklyn in the film-within-a-film. Brooklyn and Sandusky each occupy the position of straight man in character in the film-within-a-film and its cast, being the only actor without an internal conflict or deep-seated insecurity. He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high. | Danny McBride as Cody Underwood: The film's explosives expert and helicopter pilot. He is a pyromaniac. | Brandon T. Jackson as Alpa Chino: A closeted homosexual rapper who is attempting to cross over into acting, portraying a soldier named Motown, while promoting his \"Bust-A-Nut\" candy bar and energy drink, \"Booty Sweat\". He feels his image as a rapper would not allow him to be open as gay. His name is a play on Al Pacino.[7][8] Before the faux trailers, a faux commercial for \"Booty Sweat\" and \"Bust-A-Nut\" appears, accompanied by the song \"I Love Tha Pussy\" and the slogan \"Pop An Ass Open!\". | Bill Hader as Rob Slolom: Grossman's assistant and right-hand man. | Nick Nolte as Sergeant John \"Four Leaf\" Tayback: The author of Tropic Thunder, a fake memoir of his war experiences on which the film-within-a-film is based. He suggests the idea of dropping the actors in the middle of the jungle to get them looking and feeling like soldiers lost in a foreign land. | Matthew McConaughey as Rick \"Pecker\" Peck: Speedman's extremely devoted agent and best friend. | Brandon Soo Hoo as Tran: The 12-year-old young leader of the Flaming Dragon gang. The character was compared to Karen National Union guerrilla leaders Johnny and Luther Htoo.[9] | Reggie Lee as Byong: The second-in-command of the Flaming Dragon gang. | Tom Cruise as Les Grossman: The profane, ill-tempered studio executive producing Tropic Thunder. | Various actors and celebrities portray themselves, including Tobey Maguire, Tyra Banks, Maria Menounos, Martin Lawrence, The Mooney Suzuki, Jason Bateman, Lance Bass, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Alicia Silverstone, and Jon Voight. Christine Taylor (Stiller's wife), Mini Anden, Anthony Ruivivar, Rachel Avery, and Yvette Nicole Brown have roles as minor characters in the film. Co-writer Justin Theroux appears in two brief roles as a UH-1 Huey gunner and the disc jockey from Zoolander (shown in a deleted scene).[10][11]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"\"... I feel the tone of the movie is its own thing. I think there are elements of satire, but I don't think it should be categorized just as that. There are elements of parody in it, but obviously I don't think it's just that. I feel like hopefully it's its own thing, which has a lot of familiar stuff that we are playing off of.\" | Stiller developed the premise for Tropic Thunder while shooting Empire of the Sun,[13] in which he played a small part. Stiller wanted to make a film based on the actors he knew who, after taking part in boot camps to prepare for war film roles, became \"self-important\" and \"self-involved\" and appeared to believe they had been part of a real military unit.[14][15] | Co-writer Theroux revealed that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder.[16] The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter.[17][18] Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of the inner workings of Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write.[15] Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.[19] | Etan Cohen created the role of Kirk Lazarus as a way of lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role.[13][20] Downey was approached by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii.[21] Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his first reaction was, \"This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!\" and that Stiller responded, \"Yeah, I know — isn't it great?\"[22] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately.[6] Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis.[23] The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers).[24] Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform.[25] Downey required between one and a half to two hours of make-up application.[26][27] According to Downey, \"One makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle.\"[27] | Downey acknowledged the potential controversy over his role: \"At the end of the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell [in Soul Man], I would've stayed home.\"[13] Jackson stated: \"When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [act] he, like, became a black man ... It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor.\"[28] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: \"When people see the movie — in the context of the film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously.\"[29] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.[25] | Cruise was initially set to cameo as Stiller's character's agent, Rick Peck. Instead, Cruise suggested adding a studio head character, and the idea was incorporated into the script. Stiller and Cruise worked together to create the new character, Les Grossman, as a middle-aged businessman. The role required that Cruise don a fatsuit, large prosthetic hands, and a bald cap.[3][24] It was Cruise's idea to give the character large hands and dance to \"Low\".[30] Stiller intended to keep Cruise's role a secret until the film's release. In addition, Paramount Pictures refused to release promotional pictures of Cruise's character to the media.[31] In November 2007, images of Cruise wearing a bald headpiece and a fatsuit appeared on Inside Edition, as well as on the Internet.[32][33] Cruise's attorneys threatened a lawsuit if photos showing Cruise in costume were published.[34] They approached various sites that were hosting the image and quickly had it removed.[35] A representative for Cruise stated: \"Mr. Cruise's appearance was supposed to be a surprise for his fans worldwide. Paparazzi have ruined what should have been a fun discovery for moviegoers.\"[35] The photography agency INF, who debuted the image, responded with a statement: \"While these pictures were taken without breaking any criminal or civil laws, we've decided to pull them from circulation effective immediately.\"[32][34] | Serving as a last-minute replacement, Tobey Maguire was only available to be on set for two hours to film his scenes in Satan's Alley.[36] Downey said he was amazed Maguire would agree to do the film and felt like they were creating a \"karmic pay-off\" for their scenes together in the 2000 film Wonder Boys, where Downey's character has a one-night stand with Maguire's character.[6] After Cruise vacated the role of Rick Peck, Owen Wilson was cast to play the part. Following his suicide attempt in August 2007, Wilson dropped out of the film and was replaced by Matthew McConaughey.[37] | Although Southern California and Mexico were considered for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected for the majority of the shooting.[38] Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission.[39] John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather.[40] Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters.[38][41] After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming.[3][38] Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.[38] | Tropic Thunder was the first major studio production on Kaua'i in five years. After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than $60 million to the local economy.[38][42] Tim Ryan, the executive editor of Hawaii Film & Video Magazine, commented on the filming on the island: \"I think Tropic Thunder will give Kaua'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ... It should put Kaua'i back on the production consideration radar.\"[43] Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and principal photography began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteen weeks over seven separate locations on the island.[43][44] Much of the filming took place on private land as well as conservation status designated areas.[42] Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film.[43] Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters.[45] Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months.[46] The island's erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues.[47][48] The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain.[40] | The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted to ensure the war scenes, including the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements.[49] The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen.[50][51] Animatics were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.[52] | Six companies working on different scenes and elements created 500 shots of visual effects in the film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings.[53] CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release.[54] To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: \"We worked really hard to make the CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, but at the same time he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade ... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that ... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool ... and feels kind of real.\"[53] | Filming the large napalm explosion in the opening scene of the film required a 450-foot (137-meter) row of explosive pots containing 1,100 gallons (4,165 liters) of gasoline and diesel fuel. All the palm trees used in the explosion were moved to the specific location after the crew determined the impact of the lighting and necessary camera angles.[55] Due to the size and cost of the 1.25-second explosion, it was only performed once and was captured by twelve cameras.[49][56][57] For the safety of the crew and cast, the detonators were added one hour before the explosion and nobody was allowed to be within 400 feet (120 m) during detonation.[58][59] The explosion was made up of twelve individual explosions and resulted in a mushroom cloud that reached 350 feet (110 m) in the air.[49][56] For the scene in the film, Danny McBride's character, Cody Underwood, was the only actor shown in the shot of the explosion. All the other characters were added digitally.[60] The explosion of the bridge in one of the final scenes used nine cameras to capture the shot, and the crew was required to be 3,000 feet (910 m) away for their safety.[51]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Ben Stiller","m_produced_by":"Ben Stiller | Stuart Cornfeld | Eric McLeod","m_screenplay_by":"Ben Stiller | Justin Theroux | Etan Cohen","m_story_by":"Ben Stiller | Justin Theroux","m_starring":"Ben Stiller | Jack Black | Robert Downey, Jr. | Steve Coogan | Jay Baruchel | Danny McBride | Brandon T.

The film also stars Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black. The main plot revolves around a group of prima donna actors who are making a fictional Vietnam War film. When their frustrated director decides to drop them in the middle of a jungle, they are forced to rely on their acting skills in order to survive the real action and danger. Written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen, the film was produced by Red Hour Films and distributed by Paramount Pictures through DreamWorks Pictures. | Stiller's idea for the film originated while playing a minor role in Empire of the Sun, and he later enlisted Theroux and Cohen to help complete the script. After the film was green-lit in 2006, filming took place in 2007 on the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i over thirteen weeks and was later deemed the largest film production in the island's history. The film had an extensive marketing promotion, including faux websites for the three main characters and their fictional films, airing a fictional television special, and selling the energy drink advertised in the film, \"Booty Sweat\". | The film received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the film's characters, story, faux trailers, and the performances of Stiller, Downey, and Tom Cruise, though the depiction of the mentally handicapped proved controversial. The film's soundtrack and score debuted on August 5, 2008, before the film's theatrical release. In its North American opening weekend, the film earned US$26 million and retained the number one position for the first three weekends of release. Downey received Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for his performance, with both him and Cruise receiving nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. The film grossed more than $188 million worldwide before its release on home video on November 18, 2008. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"TROPIC THUNDER (15)\".
