{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Luciano Pavarotti plays a world famous Italian tenor opera singer by the name of Giorgio Fini. While in Boston for a concert Fini gets a phone call asking him to perform at The Met. The call brings up bad memories from his disastrous appearance there seven years earlier. It scares him to the point where he cannot sing at rehearsal. Everyone panics thinking he is losing his voice. | His business manager (Eddie Albert) has a female throat specialist Pamela Taylor, played by Kathryn Harrold, look Fini over. Fini at first refuses believing her not to be a doctor but \"a nurse\" because she is a woman. After being scared into seeing her by his manager, she immediately detects that the problem is psychological not physical. Taylor makes up a serious sounding name for the condition and gives Fini a shot to cure it (which she reveals to Fini's business manager is harmless vitamin B12). After reacting to the prick of the needle, Fini instantly gets his voice back and proceeds to sing the following day at the Hatch Shell in Boston. | Fini is immediately physically attracted to Taylor, and even though he is married with two children, she agrees to go out on a dinner date. The date does not go well, but Fini is persistent, visiting the hospital where Dr. Taylor works. His quick thinking helps calm a scared child getting ready for surgery to remove his tonsils: promising icecream which he delivers after the surgery. Impressed by his handling of the children, she agrees to another date. She eventually becomes his traveling companion. After spending a romantic week in San Francisco and the wine country visiting friends of Fini, the two eventually fall in love. He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the Giacomo Puccini opera Turandot. However, because Fini refuses to leave his wife, Taylor throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Fini is singing Nessun Dorma to her.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The movie opened to negative reviews and is considered Schaffner's weakest film.
