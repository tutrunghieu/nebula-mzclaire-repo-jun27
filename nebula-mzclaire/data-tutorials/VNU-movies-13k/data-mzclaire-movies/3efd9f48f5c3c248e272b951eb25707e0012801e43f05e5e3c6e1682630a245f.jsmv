His four lieutenants die preserving him. Awakening in 1983, he believes the world has lost its way without his presence because the \"weak\" rule it. Aiming to destroy the world and remake it, he recruits Cairo pickpocket Ororo Munroe, who can control weather, and upgrades her power. | In East Berlin, shape-shifting mutant Raven investigates an underground fight club and discovers mutant champion Angel, who possesses a pair of large feathered wings on his back, and Kurt Wagner, who can teleport. Raven rescues Kurt and employs the services of black marketeer Caliban to transport him to America. En Sabah Nur recruits Caliban's enforcer, Psylocke, who leads him to Angel. En Sabah Nur enhances both their powers, transforming Angel's wings into metal. | Alex Summers discovers that his younger brother, Scott, is manifesting his mutation for shooting optic beams. Alex takes Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's educational institute in Westchester County, New York in hopes that Xavier and Hank McCoy will teach him how to control his abilities. Scott meets the telepathic and telekinetic Jean Grey, and the two develop an attraction. Raven brings Kurt to the institute. Apocalypse's powers cause disturbances around the world, leading Xavier and Alex to consult with CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, who has been researching the legend of Nur, with her previous memories of their relationship erased by Xavier. | In Poland, the metal-controlling mutant Erik Lehnsherr lives with his wife and their young daughter, Nina. He uses his powers to save a coworker, prompting police to come capture him. When they accidentally kill Erik's family, he retaliates by murdering them. En Sabah Nur approaches the disheartened Erik and takes him to Auschwitz, where Erik's power first manifested. Erik destroys the camp and joins him. | En Sabah Nur enters Xavier's mind while Xavier is using the mutant-locating computer Cerebro and co-opting Xavier's powers, forces all global superpowers to launch Earth's entire nuclear arsenal into space to prevent interference. He and his new lieutenants arrive at the mansion and kidnap Xavier. Attempting to stop them, Alex accidentally causes an explosion that destroys the mansion. Peter Maximoff—having learned that he is Erik's son, and hoping that Xavier can help to find him—arrives in time to use his superspeed to evacuate the students just before the explosion destroys the building, but Alex is presumed dead. Colonel William Stryker's forces subsequently capture Hank, Raven, Peter, and Moira, and take them to a military facility for interrogation. Scott, Jean and Kurt covertly follow and liberate their comrades using Stryker's mind-controlled and brainwashed experiment, Weapon X, whose memories Jean partially restores. | At En Sabah Nur's behest, Erik uses his powers to control Earth's magnetic poles, causing widespread destruction across the planet and mass casualties. En Sabah Nur plans to transfer his consciousness into Xavier's body and use Xavier's power to enslave the minds of every person on earth. Xavier secretly sends a telepathic distress call to Jean, and the others travel to Cairo to battle Apocalypse and his horsemen. They rescue Xavier, but he loses his hair as the process nears completion. Angel is defeated and incapacitated in the battle. Erik and Ororo are convinced to turn on En Sabah Nur and with the help of Cyclops, they keep him occupied physically while Xavier fights him telepathically in the astral plane. Finally, Xavier convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers, incinerating En Sabah Nur in the ensuing chaos before he says \"All has been revealed\". Psylocke flees after noticing she is out numbered from the loss. | Xavier restores Moira's memories, and they rekindle their relationship. Erik and Jean help reconstruct the school, but Erik refuses Xavier's offer to stay and help teach. Peter decides not to tell Erik yet that he is his son. The X-Men are revived, with Hank and Raven training new recruits Scott, Jean, Ororo, Kurt and Peter for the battles ahead. | In a post-credits scene, men in suits visit the Weapon X facility to retrieve data on Stryker's mutant research, including an X-ray and a blood sample marked \"Weapon X\", on behalf of the Essex Corporation.","m_cast":"James McAvoy as Charles Xavier / Professor X | Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto | Jennifer Lawrence as Raven Darkhölme / Mystique | Oscar Isaac as En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse | Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy / Beast | Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert | Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver | Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers / Cyclops | Sophie Turner as Jean Grey | Olivia Munn as Psylocke | Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler[15] | Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe / Storm | Lucas Till as Alex Summers / Havok | Josh Helman as Colonel William Stryker | Ben Hardy as Angel | Lana Condor as Jubilee | Additionally, Hugh Jackman makes an uncredited appearance as Logan / Wolverine, in his Weapon X form.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 48%, based on 270 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Overloaded action and a cliched villain take the focus away from otherwise strong performers and resonant themes, making X-Men: Apocalypse a middling chapter of the venerable superhero franchise.\"[97] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[98] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.[99] | Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a thinking person's action movie\", and complimenting the movie for its high stakes.[100] Bruce Kirkland from the Toronto Sun gave the film a positive review, acknowledging, \"Piece by piece, Singer fits this ninth film in the franchise (which includes Deadpool) into the X-Men universe like a master puzzle maker. He does it so well, at least in terms of storytelling, that the X-Men franchise still has a vigorous future.\"[101] | Ignatiy Vishnevetsky from The A.V. Club wrote, \"Much of what makes X-Men: Apocalypse legitimately interesting also makes it frustrating and lopsided, since Singer and screenwriter-producer Simon Kinberg remain committed to the structure of an overlong comic-book blockbuster, complete with a climax in which the world has to be saved using as many different colors of energy beam as possible.\"[102] Mike Ryan of Uproxx disparaged the film's story as redundant and stale, arguing, \"I get it: Life is hard for mutants. We all get it. It’s literally the only thing mutants ever seem to talk about. It is odd that other superheroes seem to get to have some fun, but never the X-Men. Here we are, 16 years later, and everyone involved is still sad. It feels repetitive.\"[103]","m_production":"The film was announced by Bryan Singer in December 2013 via Twitter, before Days of Future Past was released to theaters.[29] In the same month, Simon Kinberg, Dan Harris, and Michael Dougherty were revealed by Singer to be attached to work on the film's story.[30] According to Singer, the film would focus on the origin of the mutants, and features the younger versions of Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm.[31][32] Singer also said that he was considering Gambit and a younger version of Nightcrawler to appear.[33] According to Kinberg, it would take place in 1983, and completes a trilogy that began with 2011's X-Men: First Class.[34][35] In September 2014, 20th Century Fox officially announced that Singer would direct the film.[36] Singer has called the film \"kind of a conclusion of six X-Men films, yet a potential rebirth of younger, newer characters\" and the \"true birth of the X-Men\".[37] | It will address historical mutant-cy, meaning the deep past, mutant origins and things like that. It’s something that's always intrigued me when we think about our Gods and our history and miracles and powers. | Singer said that Apocalypse is the main focus of the film. Kinberg said that the younger versions of Scott Summers, Storm, and Jean Grey appearing in the film are \"as much a part of the film as the main cast\". He described Summers as \"not yet the squeaky-clean leader\", Storm as a \"troubled character who is going down the wrong path in life\", and Grey as \"complex, interesting and not fully mature.\"[38] Kinberg also said that the film delivers on the dramatic story and emotion of the last two films and that it acts like the culmination of the main characters portrayed by Lawrence, McAvoy, Fassbender and Hoult.[39] Kinberg said First Class, Days of Future Past, and Apocalypse formed a trilogy about Mystique, explaining, \"She starts in First Class entirely on Charles’ side, ends up following Erik, and we then find her in Days of Future Past and she’s on her own because Erik is gone. She’s on her own side in that movie but is drawn toward Charles by the end of the film and shoots Erik. Then in Apocalypse she comes back to Charles. There’s a full circle narrative over the span of this little trilogy that is about Mystique from beginning with Charles in the mansion and ending with Charles in the mansion, but not as the same timid little girl we met in First Class.\"[40] | In October 2014, casting for X-Men: Apocalypse began.[41] In November, Singer confirmed that Oscar Isaac would portray Apocalypse.[42] In January 2015, Singer announced that Alexandra Shipp, Sophie Turner, and Tye Sheridan would portray young Storm, Jean, and Cyclops.[43] The same month, Kinberg confirmed that Rose Byrne would reprise her role as Moira MacTaggert in the film.[7] In February, Kodi Smit-McPhee was cast as Nightcrawler and Ben Hardy was cast in an unspecified role.[15][44] In March, Singer announced that Lana Condor was cast as Jubilation Lee.[45] In April, Singer confirmed that Hardy would portray Angel, Olivia Munn would portray Psylocke, and Lucas Till would return as Havok.[46][47][19] In May, Singer announced that the mutant Caliban would appear in the film.[48][49] In July, Hoult revealed on Conan that Josh Helman would return as William Stryker.[50] In April 2016, Hugh Jackman confirmed that he would make a cameo appearance as Wolverine.[51] | Principal photography commenced on April 27, 2015, in Montreal, Canada.[52] In late August, the first-unit production for the film wrapped.[53] Additional filming took place in January 2016.[54] | Australia-based Rising Sun Pictures provided, as it did for X-Men: Days of Future Past, the effects for Quicksilver's time-stopping, quick motion effects in the mansion rescue scene, and also other effects, including when Cyclops splits Professor Xavier's favorite tree in half.[55] Aerial footage of snow-capped mountains as Stryker traveled in his helicopter to the secret base was provided by SmartDrones of St. Albert, Alberta, Canada.[56] | On March 2, 2015, it was announced that John Ottman, who composed the scores for X2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past, would return to write and compose the score for Apocalypse. On May 20, 2016, the official soundtrack was released as a digital download. In addition to Ottman's score, the film features the second movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's seventh symphony and two songs contemporary to the film's 1983 setting, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" by Eurythmics and \"The Four Horsemen\" by Metallica.[57]","m_sequel":"In May 2016, screenwriter Simon Kinberg said the next X-Men film will be set in the 1990s.[106] He additionally acknowledged the possibility of re-adapting \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\", which had been adapted in the original X-Men film trilogy,[107][108] and said the post-credits scene mentioning the Essex Corporation is related to the upcoming Wolverine sequel, and that it could have ties to Gambit as well as the following X-Men film.[109] | Director Bryan Singer said he would be interested in having the villain Proteus in an X-Men film.[110] He also said he will be stepping away from the franchise but could envision returning to it at a later date in some capacity.[111]","m_based_on":"X-Men  by Stan Lee Jack Kirby","m_directed_by":"Bryan Singer","m_produced_by":"Bryan Singer | Lauren Shuler Donner | Simon Kinberg | Hutch Parker","m_screenplay_by":"Simon Kinberg","m_story_by":"Bryan Singer | Michael Dougherty | Dan Harris | Simon Kinberg","m_starring":"James McAvoy | Michael Fassbender | Jennifer Lawrence | Oscar Isaac | Nicholas Hoult | Rose Byrne | Tye Sheridan | Sophie Turner | Olivia Munn | Lucas Till","m_music_by":"John Ottman","m_cinematography":"Newton Thomas Sigel","m_edited_by":"John Ottman | Michael Louis Hill","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"May 9, 2016 (2016-05-09) (London) | May 27, 2016 (2016-05-27) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"144 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$178 million[2]","m_box_office":"$529 million[2] | X-Men: Apocalypse is a 2016 American superhero film based on the fictional X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics.

In X-Men: Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to cleanse the human race and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. | The film was announced by Singer in December 2013, with Kinberg, Dougherty and Harris attached to develop the story. Casting began in October 2014, while principal photography commenced in April 2015 in Montreal and ended in August of the same year. X-Men: Apocalypse premiered in London on May 9, 2016, and was released in North America on May 27, in 3D and 2D, and in IMAX 3D in select international markets.

The deal included retail displays and special packaging markings, TV and cinema commercials, and social media posts featuring M&M's characters mixed with elements of the X-Men. The first image of M&M candies wearing Storm and Magneto costumes was released on the day of the announcement.[60] | In December 2015, Kia Motors collaborated with 20th Century Fox to create a custom Kia Sportage to promote the film. Designed after Mystique, the car was revealed at the 2016 Australian Open. It is Kia's second \"X-Car\" project after the Kia Sorento customized for the home media release of Days of Future Past and the 2015 Australian Open.[61][62][63][64] A trailer released in the same month received criticism from Rajan Zed, a United States-based Hindu cleric, who stated that the part where Apocalypse claims himself to have been called \"Krishna\" was an offense to the Hindu religion, and demanded that Singer remove all references to Krishna from the trailer, and the film itself.[65][66] The references to Krishna were removed from the film's final cut.[67] On January 4, 2016, Kia Motors released the first promo video of the car, featuring Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal.[68] | In April 2016, Coldwell Banker partnered with 20th Century Fox to list the X-Mansion for $75 million.[69] The fictional listing included a video tour of the mansion and stories of the home from the perspective of characters such as Charles Xavier and Scott Summers. The fake property was listed by agent Kala V. Rhomedren, an anagram for Raven Darkholme.[70][71] That same month, Fox released a fake TV show called \"In the Footsteps of...\" narrated by George Takei which is inspired by the classic TV series In Search of... that focus on En Sabah Nur's origins.[72][73][74] In May 2016, Fox released a fake TV Commercial for the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters with Lana Condor as Jubilee. They also released a video voiced mail message a week later and a fake TV show called Fables of the Flush & Fabulous with Robin Leach which is inspired by Leach's show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.[75][76][77][78] | Billboards in Los Angeles and New York City promoting the film garnered controversy for showing an image of Apocalypse choking Mystique, with critics saying the ad disregards the issue of violence against women. Among those opposed to the material was actress Rose McGowan, who told The Hollywood Reporter \"There is a major problem when the men and women at 20th Century Fox think casual violence against women is the way to market a film. There is no context in the ad, just a woman getting strangled. The fact that no one flagged this is offensive and frankly, stupid.\"[79] In apologizing for the billboard, Fox said it intended to remove the image from circulation.[80]","m_reference":"^ \"X-Men: Apocalypse [2D] (12A)\".
