The part eventually went to Adolphe Menjou.[2] Both Brian Donlevy, who played the role of \"Speed McFarland\" on Broadway,[3] and boxer-turned-actor Max Baer were considered for roles in the film, but were not cast.[2] Actress Ida Lupino was to have played \"Polly Pringle\", but dropped out because of illness, to be replaced by Dorothy Wilson. Helen Mack and Verree Teasdale were also replacements, the parts having originally gone to Sally Blane and Gail Patrick.[2] Although they are not in the film, before filming began, the Dionne Quintuplets had been expected to make an appearance.[2] | Filming on The Milky Way began on 22 July 1935,[4] but it was interrupted by the illnesses of Menjou, Teasdale and director Leo McCarey, who was hospitalized. McCarey's place was taken by his brother, Ray McCarey and by veteran director Norman Z. McLeod.[2] During filming, when a suitable white horse for Burleigh could not be found, make-up artists bleached a dark-colored horse blonde.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Leo McCarey","m_produced_by":"E.
