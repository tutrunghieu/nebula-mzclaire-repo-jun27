{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Sixty-five million years ago, a meteorite crashes into the Earth, killing the dinosaurs and causing the universe to split into two parallel dimensions. The surviving dinosaurs cross over into this new dimension and evolve into a humanoid race. | In the present, Mario and Luigi are two Italian American plumbers living in Brooklyn, New York, who are currently being driven out of business by the mafia-like Scapelli Construction Company led by Anthony Scapelli. Later, Luigi falls in love with an orphaned NYU student named Daisy, who is digging under the Brooklyn Bridge for dinosaur bones. After a date, Daisy takes Luigi back to the bridge only to witness one of Scapelli's men sabotaging it by leaving the water pipes open. Unable to fix the flooding, Luigi and Daisy rush back to his apartment where they inform Mario about the incident. The trio returns to the flooding where the Mario Bros. manage to fix it but are knocked unconscious by Iggy and Spike, who proceed to capture Daisy. | Moments later, Mario and Luigi awaken and head deeper into the caves following Daisy's screams and discover an interdimensional portal allowing the Mario Bros. to follow Daisy. It turns out that Iggy and Spike are henchmen (and cousins) of the other world's germophobic and obsessive–compulsive dictator, King Koopa, who descended from the most revered dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The Mario Bros. realize they didn't bring Daisy's rock, a meteorite fragment which Koopa is trying to get in order to merge his world with the real world. It is then revealed that Daisy is the long-lost Princess of the other dimension. When Koopa overthrew Daisy's father (and de-evolved him into fungus), her mother took her to Brooklyn using the inter-dimensional portal. The portal was then destroyed, killing Daisy's mother in the process, but Scapelli's men inadvertently reopened the portal when they blasted the cave. Upon hearing this, Koopa sends Spike and Iggy to find both Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make him dictator of both worlds. However, after Koopa subjects them to one of his experiments to make them more intelligent, Spike and Iggy realize Koopa's evil intentions and side with the Mario Bros. Koopa believes only Daisy can merge the worlds, but the Mario Bros. are also from a different place and time. Eventually, the Mario Bros. rescue Daisy with the help of Toad, a good-natured guitarist who was punished by Koopa for performing music that protests his reign (for which he is de-evolved into a Goomba). | Eventually, the two worlds merge and Koopa turns Scapelli into a chimpanzee before going after Mario, but Luigi and Daisy bring back the rock and the worlds separate again. In Dinohattan, Mario confronts Koopa and eventually defeats him when he and Luigi fire their devolution guns at Koopa and blast him with a Bob-omb, throwing him into a chain suspended vat. Koopa, now turned into a ferocious, semi-humanoid Tyrannosaurus, jumps out of the vat, which is not far away from the Mario Bros., to deliver his final blow, but the Mario Bros. manage to destroy him once and for all by turning him further into an actual T-Rex, which is too intense for him to live through and instead turns him into primordial slime. Following Koopa's defeat, Daisy's father turns back to normal and reclaims control over the kingdom. The citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything under Koopa's influence. Luigi admits his love for Daisy and wants her to come to Brooklyn with him, but Daisy can't come until the damage caused by Koopa is repaired and thus, she wants to spend more time with her father. Heartbroken, Luigi kisses Daisy goodbye as he and Mario return home to Brooklyn, with Daisy watching them leave. Three weeks later, the Mario Bros. are getting ready for dinner when their story comes on the news and the anchorman says they should be called the \"Super Mario Bros.\" Daisy asks the Mario Bros. to help her and says, \"You're never gonna believe this!\" | In a post-credits scene, two Japanese business executives propose making a video game based on Iggy and Spike, who decide on the title The Super Koopa Cousins.","m_cast":"Bob Hoskins as Mario | John Leguizamo as Luigi | Dennis Hopper as King Koopa | Samantha Mathis as Princess Daisy | Fisher Stevens as Iggy | Richard Edson as Spike | Fiona Shaw as Lena | Mojo Nixon as Toad | Dana Kaminski as Daniella | Francesca Roberts as Big Bertha | Gianni Russo as Anthony Scapelli | Don Lake as Sgt.

Joffé met the Nintendo of America president and Hiroshi Yamauchi's son-in law Minoru Arakawa. He presented Arakawa with an initial draft of the script. One month after their meeting, Joffé went to Nintendo's corporate headquarters in Kyoto spending 10 days waiting to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi. After some time, Joffé received a phone call summoning him to Yamauchi's office. He pitched to Yamauchi the storyline which led to Nintendo receiving interest in the project. When Joffé was questioned about Nintendo having to sell the rights to a small studio company instead of a major company, he believed that Nintendo would have more control over the film.[8] Joffé left with a $2 million contract giving the temporary control of the character of Mario over to Joffé.[9] | Four drafts of the script were made. The first draft written by Jim Jennewein and Tom S. Parker focused on a comedic take on fairy tale themes on a story focusing on Mario and Luigi attempting to rescue a princess named Hildy from Koopa.[10] | Joffé visited Harold Ramis to offer him the job of being director. Ramis took up the meeting as he was a fan of the Super Mario Bros. game but declined the offer.[11] Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel were hired to direct based on their work on the television series Max Headroom.[9] | After securing the rights to the film, Lightmotive went to work finding the casting for the characters. Danny DeVito was approached to play Mario and direct the film but wanted to read the script before signing.[12] Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Keaton were both approached to play the part of King Koopa. All three actors decided not to accept the offers. Lightmotive managed to secure Tom Hanks for the role of Mario with some film executives believing that Hanks was worth more than the studio could afford.[13] Hanks was later dismissed and replaced with Bob Hoskins, who was believed to be a more profitable actor.[9]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Super Mario  by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka","m_directed_by":"Rocky Morton | Annabel Jankel","m_produced_by":"Jake Eberts | Roland Joffé","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Dan Castellaneta","m_music_by":"Alan Silvestri","m_cinematography":"Dean Semler","m_edited_by":"Mark Goldblatt","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc.","m_release_dates":"May 28, 1993 (1993-05-28) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"104 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$48 million[2]","m_box_office":"$20.9 million[2] | Super Mario Bros. is a 1993 American science fantasy adventure comedy film[3] directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. A loose live-action adaptation of the 1985 Nintendo video game of the same name and its entire franchise, the film stars Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi, Dennis Hopper as King Koopa, and Samantha Mathis as Princess Daisy. It tells the story of the eponymous Mario brothers, as they find a parallel universe, ruled by the ruthless dictator King Koopa, who seeks to merge the two dimensions together so that he can rule both worlds, leaving it up to Mario and Luigi to join forces with Princess Daisy, the daughter of the world's displaced King, to stop Koopa. | The film was released on May 28, 1993, in the United States by Hollywood Pictures, a film label of The Walt Disney Company. It was a box office bomb, grossing $20.9 million on a $48 million budget. The film was nominated for two Saturn Awards (one for Best Costume, the other for Best Make-up). | Despite being critically panned, it has become a cult film,[4] and has spawned a fan-made website,[5] a fan-made sequel comic,[6] and even a Blu-ray release in the United Kingdom.[7] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"SUPER MARIO BROS.
