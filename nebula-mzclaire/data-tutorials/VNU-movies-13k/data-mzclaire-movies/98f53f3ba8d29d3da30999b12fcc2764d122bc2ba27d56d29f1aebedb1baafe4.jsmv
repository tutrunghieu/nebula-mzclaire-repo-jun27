The other spirits that Heidi communicates with are the slaves from the underground railroad who were once sheltered in the forest by her house. | After every family member has several scary confrontations with ghosts, the slaves lead Heidi to a hidden underground cellar where she discovers their bodies, which are later given a proper memorial. Unfortunately, her trip to the cellar has allowed an evil spirit, the station master and taxidermist, who is Gordy's grandfather, to target her for his hobby. Heidi has a protector in Gordy and heeds his warnings and persuades her family to leave. However, they are too late, and the station master kidnaps her after attacking Joyce. | Heidi's mother Lisa then embraces communication with the dead, and with the help of the slaves, finds her daughter and destroys the station master's ghost. Now living in peace, Gordy helps Heidi ride her bike before he and the slaves depart to the afterlife.","m_cast":"Chad Michael Murray as Andy Wyrick | Abigail Spencer as Lisa Wyrick | Emily Alyn Lind as Heidi Wyrick | Katee Sackhoff as Joyce | Cicely Tyson as Mama Kay | Jaren Mitchell as Levi | Grant James as Mr. Gordy","m_reception":"The film received mostly negative reviews, though it fared slightly better than its predecessor, with a 19% approval rating based on 13 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes;[8] Metacritic gave the film a score of 25 out of 100, indicating \"Generally Unfavorable\" reception, based on five reviews.[9]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tom Elkins[1]","m_produced_by":"Paul Brooks Brad Kessell Scott Niemeyer Norm Waitt","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"TayAnna is the key to all","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":"Gold Circle Films[2]","m_distributed_by":"Lions Gate Entertainment","m_release_dates":"February 1, 2013 (2013-02-01) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"100 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English / Spanish","m_budget":"$1.5 million","m_box_office":"$2,382,965[4] | The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia is a 2013 psychological horror film that serves as a brother film to The Haunting in Connecticut by Gold Circle Films.
