{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Andreas and Karin Vergerus (von Sydow and Andersson) live in fine rapport, their personalities matching well. Both are quiet, contemplative, and very rational persons, not liable to act spontaneously. The intruder, \"David Kovac\", played by Elliott Gould, is in contrast an impetuous man, uncompromising, overbearing, and tormented by inner contradictions and compulsions. Karin and David become clandestine lovers, but aren't appropriate for each other. Before they meet David attempted suicide and Karin was unhappy to be reduced to a wife. They flower in their new love and it destroys their lives.","m_cast":"Elliott Gould – David Kovac | Bibi Andersson – Karin Vergerus | Max von Sydow – Andreas Vergerus | Sheila Reid – Sara Kovac | Margareta Byström – Secretary to Andreas Vergerus (uncredited) | Elsa Ebbesen – Hospital Matron (uncredited) | Dennis Gotobed – English civil servant (uncredited) | Staffan Hallerstam – Anders Vergerus (uncredited) | Barbro Hiort af Ornäs – Karin's mother (uncredited) | Åke Lindström – Dr. Holm (uncredited) | Ann-Christin Lobråten – Museum employee (uncredited) | Karin Nilsson – Neighbour (uncredited) | Maria Nolgård – Agnes Vergerus (uncredited) | Erik Nyhlén – The Archeologist (uncredited) | Bengt Ottekil – Bell boy (uncredited) | Alan Simon – Therapist at museum (uncredited) | Per Sjöstrand – Therapist (uncredited) | Aino Taube – Woman on stairs (uncredited) | Mimmo Wåhlander – Nurse (uncredited) | Carol Zavis – Stewardess (uncredited)","m_reception":"The film earned rentals of $485,000 in North America and $650,000 in other countries.
