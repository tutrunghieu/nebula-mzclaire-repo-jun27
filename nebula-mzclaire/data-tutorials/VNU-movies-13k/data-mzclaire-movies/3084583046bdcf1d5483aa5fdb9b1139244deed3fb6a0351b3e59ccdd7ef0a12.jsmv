Unfortunately, it isn't long before this wised-up tone gives way to a desperate, mindless freneticism that leaves Ms. Ricci mired in her sulk.'[6] | Joe Leydon of Variety said 'It’s not quite a catastrophe, but the updated remake of “That Darn cat” is a loud and largely charmless trifle.'[7] James Berardinelli of Reelviews was a little more lenient, stating '(the film) is a little more quirky than many Disney films, although that trait doesn't make it appreciably more watchable.'[8]","m_production":"The film was shot in three main locations: Edgefield, South Carolina; Augusta, Georgia and Aiken, South Carolina.
