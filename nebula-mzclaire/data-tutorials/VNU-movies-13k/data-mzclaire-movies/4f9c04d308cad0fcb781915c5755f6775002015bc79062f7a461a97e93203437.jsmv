Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes scored The Bank at 65% from 36 professional reviews (average rating 5.8/10), but 45% from 11 \"top critic\" reviews (average rating 5.5/10). Australian film review site Urban Cinefile's three reviewers summarized the film as \"favourable\".[3] The New York Times concluded \"As far-fetched as the movie is ... conveys an engaging zest for upper-crust mischief. The two stories come together in the hurtling final lap as Wayne confronts Simon in his country house while Jim puts his perfected program into operation. The upshot is a whopper of an ending that is as silly as it is satisfying.\"[4] The New York Post gave the film 1.5/4 stars, stating \"Despite a crafty premise and a clever kink in the tale that almost saves it, Connolly isn't dexterous enough to achieve the Hitchockian level of suspense the movie needs.\" [5] The Los Angeles Times stated \"Connolly might well have constructed a brisker, more exciting picture with more vivid and involving characters. As it is, the film takes too long to become truly compelling.\"[6]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Connolly","m_produced_by":"John Maynard","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"David Wenham Anthony LaPaglia Sibylla Budd Steve Rodgers Mitchell Butel Mandy McElhinney Greg Stone Kazuhiro Muroyama","m_music_by":"Alan John","m_cinematography":"Tristan Milani","m_edited_by":"Nick Meyers","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Madman Entertainment[1]","m_release_dates":"6 September 2001","m_running_time":"106 minutes","m_country":"Australia","m_language":"English | The Bank is a 2001 Australian thriller/drama film directed by Robert Connolly and starring David Wenham and Anthony LaPaglia. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"Bank, the\".
