{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"High-school sweethearts Frank Beardsley (a widowed U.S. Coast Guard admiral, currently serving as superintendent of the US Coast Guard Academy) and Helen North (a widowed handbag designer), are reunited when Frank and his family move back to his hometown of New London, Connecticut. After unexpectedly encountering each other at a restaurant while on separate dates, they run into each other again at their 30-year class reunion. | Instantly rekindling their old sparks, the two quickly decide to marry in a private ceremony. They are quite aware of the fact that Frank already has eight children from his first marriage, and Helen has 10 from hers. The family moves into a new home on the same property as the lighthouse where Frank and Helen shared their first kiss, joined by the North children's numerous pets (including a pot-bellied pig and a guinea pig), and Frank's housekeeper, Mrs. Munion. | It soon becomes apparent that Coast Guard Admiral Frank has a very regimented view of how things should be done, whereas Helen is an artist (a designer by trade) with a more free-spirited, lackadaisical attitude. Their respective children are shocked by the news of their parents' quick wedding and do not get along well at first, even turning a planned lighthouse renovation project into an all-out paint fight. | Frank's oldest son William calls a meeting among the children and explains that they can better rid themselves of their new situation by joining forces to make their parents' respective philosophical differences apparent, which will cause them to fight. But the children gradually bond, attending their siblings' soccer games and helping William in his class-president campaign. | A short time later, Frank and Helen attend a formal Coast Guard dinner where Frank's superior, Commandant Sherman, officially offers Frank the opportunity to be his successor. Frank respectfully declines the offer, citing both his obligation to the Coast Guard Academy and his new family. Meanwhile, as the young children have a food fight upstairs in the bedroom, the older ones throw a wild party downstairs. When the parents return to find the place in total chaos, Frank is furious and Helen's more laid-back approach only angers him more. This causes their worst fight yet, and the children, realizing how happy their parents have been together, begin to realize that they might have pushed things too far. | The next day, Frank informs Helen that he has decided to take the position as Commandant after all, and the pair schedule a family meeting to inform the children. As they return from school, jubilant over having defended their younger siblings from bullies—and with the news of William having won the class election—Frank quickly deflates the mood by telling the children of his decision to accept the new position. Feeling guilty for having torn their parents apart, the children set about undoing their mistakes, even enlisting Helen to aid in their efforts. Together, the older children launch the family's boat in an effort to catch Frank (thereby fulfilling his previous dream of having an all-family sailing team that failed earlier), but he is convinced that Helen no longer wants to be with him, until he sees her turn on the lighthouse spotlight (a reference to a story Frank had told Helen about a beautiful female lighthouse keeper). Successfully reunited, the pair tie the knot once again, this time with the rest of the family involved.","m_cast":"Dennis Quaid as Rear Admiral Frank Beardsley | Rene Russo as Helen White-North","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Yours, Mine and Ours  by Melville Shavelson Mort Lachman Madelyn Davis Bob Carroll, Jr.","m_directed_by":"Raja Gosnell","m_produced_by":"Robert Simonds Michael G.
