{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Author Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss) writes about a childhood incident when he and three buddies undertook a journey to find the body of a missing boy near the town of Castle Rock, Oregon, over Labor Day weekend in 1959. | Young Gordie (Wil Wheaton) is a quiet, bookish boy with a penchant for writing and telling stories. His parents, grieving the recent death of Gordie's older brother, neglect their youngest son. To cope, Gordie spends much time with his friends: Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), whose family are criminals and alcoholics; Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), an eccentric and physically scarred boy; and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), who is overweight and timid, often making him the target of bullying. | Vern overhears his older brother, Billy (Casey Siemaszko), and Billy's friend, Charlie Hogan (Gary Riley), discussing Ray Brower, a young boy who was reportedly struck and killed by a train. They want to search for the body; but Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern decide to follow the local rail line and find Ray first, making them local heroes. Chris steals his father's M1911 pistol; and he, Gordie, Vern, and Teddy head out on the train tracks. | The boys stop at a nearby junkyard to get a drink using a pump. The junkyard owner is notorious around Castle Rock for being the owner of a vicious and rarely seen dog, Chopper, famous for being able to attack certain parts of the human anatomy. They hang out in the junkyard for a while when the boys send Gordie out to buy food at a nearby general store. When Gordie returns, he sees the other three boys jumping the fence. Gordie walks over to join them; but Milo Pressman (William Bronder), the junkman, spots him and sends Chopper after him. Gordie runs and jumps the fence with Chopper in close pursuit, barely escaping the dog. The boys discover that Chopper is a small dog and could easily be overthrown by an adolescent. They tease Chopper; but Pressman arrives and calls Teddy's father a loony, inciting Teddy's rage and causing the other boys to keep him from killing Pressman. Teddy is saddened by the insult; and Vern, Chris and Gordie help him. | At nighttime, Gordie tells the other boys a story of Davie \"Lard-Ass\" Hogan (Andy Lindberg), an overweight boy who is constantly teased and bullied. He was born with a glandular condition which caused him to become obese, resulting in other kids and family members ridiculing and teasing him. Hogan enters a pie-eating contest; but his main goal was not to win, but to exact revenge. Prior to the contest, Hogan had consumed castor oil and a raw egg, working as emetics, planning to vomit on one of the other contestants, triggering a chain reaction of every witness vomiting, the majority being the bullies who had abused him earlier. After eating a fifth pie, he vomits, inducing the vomiting of all the crowd members, resulting in humiliation and embarrassment of his tormentors. The boys are impressed with the story but disappointed with the end. | After a series of misadventures and much self-revelation, the boys locate the body. However, local hoodlum \"Ace\" Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) and his gang including Chris' older brother \"Eyeball\" (Bradley Gregg), Billy, Charlie, Vince Desjardins (Jason Oliver) and two other gang members arrive in cars to claim the body and the credit for finding it. When Chris refuses to step aside, Ace pulls out his switchblade with intent to kill him and the youths, but Gordie intervenes and threatens to shoot Ace with the pistol from before. Outmatched, Ace and his gang retreat, but not before Ace vows to exact revenge on the boys. The boys agree to report the body via an anonymous phone call to the authorities. They hike back to Castle Rock, bid each other farewell until they see each other in a few days at Junior High School. | The present-day Gordie writes that while Gordie and Chris stayed friends, they drifted apart from the other two shortly thereafter. Vern married immediately after high school, has four children, and drives a forklift at a local lumber yard. Teddy tried enlisting in the army but was turned down because of his ear injury and impaired eyesight. He had served some time in prison and now does odd jobs around Castle Rock. Chris went on to college and became a lawyer. When attempting to break up a fight in a fast-food restaurant, he was fatally stabbed in the neck. | The film ends with Gordie finishing his memoir after his son asks him again if he is going to take the boys swimming. After he types the last words of it into his computer, Gordie goes outside of his opulent home, driving away with his son and his son's friend in his Land Rover, indicating the author has enjoyed financial success in his life.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"The film was a box office success in North America.

I was awkward and nerdy and shy and uncomfortable in my own skin and really, really sensitive, and River was cool and really smart and passionate and even at that age kind of like a father figure to some of us, Jerry was one of the funniest people I had ever seen in my life, either before or since, and Corey was unbelievably angry and in an incredible amount of pain and had an absolutely terrible relationship with his parents.[3] | Parts of the film were shot in Brownsville, Oregon, which stood in for the fictional town of Castle Rock.

According to screenwriter Raynold Gideon, \"...it sounded like either a sex film, a bodybuilding film or another Stephen King horror film. Rob came up with Stand by Me, and it ended up being the least unpopular option.\"[4] | The film's musical score was composed by Jack Nitzsche.
