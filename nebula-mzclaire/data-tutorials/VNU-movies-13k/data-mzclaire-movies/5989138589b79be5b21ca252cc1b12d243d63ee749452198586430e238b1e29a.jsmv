{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In eighteenth century France, the Marquise de Merteuil (Annette Bening), a beautiful wealthy widow, learns from her cousin Madame de Volanges (Siân Phillips) that Volanges' 15-year-old daughter Cécile (Fairuza Balk) has been betrothed to a middle-age man named Gercourt (Jeffrey Jones)—Merteuil's own secret lover. Volanges confides in Merteuil that the arranged marriage required that Cécile be raised in a convent to ensure her chastity. Unaware that Merteuil is Gercourt's paramour, Volanges reveals that according to Gercourt, he is having trouble breaking off relations with his \"former\" mistress who is mentally unbalanced. | Angered over the loss of her lover and his slight of her character, Merteuil devises a devious plan of revenge. She approaches her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont (Colin Firth), and proposes that he seduce the virgin Cécile prior to her wedding night when Gercourt will learn he was \"not the first to arrive\". Valmont declines Merteuil's request. He is more interested in pursuing Madame de Tourvel (Meg Tilly), a beautiful married woman staying at his aunt's estate. When the subject of infidelity is introduced, Tourvel insists she would never be unfaithful to her husband who is traveling abroad on business. Merteuil later mocks Valmont for his futile desire for Tourvel and makes him a wager: if Valmont succeeds in bedding Madame de Tourvel, he may also bed Merteuil; if he fails, he must consign himself to a monastery. | After learning that Cécile's music teacher, Danceny (Henry Thomas), has been writing love letters to Cécile, Merteuil gains the confidence of the young girl who confesses she loves Danceny. Merteuil then convinces her cousin to allow Cécile to join her in the country while helping Cécile write secret love letters to Danceny. Soon after, Merteuil and Cécile join Valmont at his aunt's country estate where Valmont flirts playfully with the innocent young girl. When Merteuil suggests that Valmont help Cécile write a love letter to Danceny, Valmont agrees and ends up taking Cécile's virginity. When Cécile confides in Merteuil about her experience with Valmont, Merteuil encourages the girl to marry Gercourt and keep Danceny as her lover. | Meanwhile, Valmont is unsuccessful in his numerous attempts at wooing Tourvel, who has been warned of his sexual scheming and debauchery. When Tourvel feels her defenses weakening and her attraction to Valmont growing, she flees to the city to get away from the temptation. After learning of her departure, Valmont rides to her residence and is there when she arrives. Surprised by Valmont's romantic actions and unable to resist her feelings for him, Tourvel finally returns his affections and they make love. In the morning, Tourvel leaves for the market to prepare a meal for her lover, but when she returns Valmont is gone. | Soon after, Valmont arrives at Merteuil's residence to collect his \"prize\" from her. When Merteuil refuses to honor her wager, Valmont leaves in anger. He goes to Cécile and convinces her to write Danceny a letter explaining that Merteuil encouraged her to marry Gercourt and keep Danceny as her lover. Tourvel later comes to Valmont and spends the night, leaving before he wakes the next morning. Later, when Danceny reads Cécile's letter, he visits Merteuil and threatens her, demanding she send a letter to Cécile recommending that she call off her marriage. When Valmont arrives, he discovers that Merteuil has already seduced Danceny and revealed that Valmont took Cécile's virginity. | The following day, Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel set for the following morning. That evening, Valmont prepares for the duel by drinking himself into a drunken stupor. The next morning, Valmont arrives at the duel hung over and Danceny refuses to duel him in his condition. Refusing to apologize to Danceny for his actions, he charges toward the young man with his sword drawn and is quickly slain after a brief exchange. At the funeral, Cécile reveals to Valmont's aunt that she believes he is carrying her dead nephew's child. The elderly aunt is overjoyed by the news. Cécile and Gercourt are soon married in a grand ceremony in the presence of the king, with Merteuil looking on—alone. | Sometime later, Madame de Tourvel visits the country estate and lovingly places a single flower on Valmont's grave.","m_cast":"Colin Firth as Valmont | Annette Bening as Merteuil | Meg Tilly as Madame de Tourvel | Fairuza Balk as Cécile de Volanges | Siân Phillips as Madame de Volanges | Jeffrey Jones as Gercourt | Henry Thomas as Danceny | Fabia Drake as Madame de Rosemonde | T.

In the novel, Cécile miscarries Valmont's child, and at the end retires to a convent; in Valmont she is pregnant at her wedding. In the novel, letters between Valmont and Merteuil are exposed, and Merteuil is publicly ridiculed and humiliated; in Valmont, the letters are not mentioned, and Merteuil has no downfall except in the eyes of Cécile and her mother. She also does not suffer from the physical disfigurement described by Laclos in the denouement. Madame de Tourvel's future is less tragic: instead of dying of a broken heart, she returns to her forgiving and understanding older husband.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Miloš Forman","m_produced_by":"Michael Hausman | Paul Rassam","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Colin Firth | Annette Bening | Meg Tilly | Fairuza Balk | Siân Phillips | Jeffrey Jones | Henry Thomas","m_music_by":"Christopher Palmer","m_cinematography":"Miroslav Ondříček","m_edited_by":"Nena Danevic | Alan Heim","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Orion Pictures","m_release_dates":"November 17, 1989 (1989-11-17) (USA) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"137 minutes","m_country":"United States | France","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$33,000,000 (estimated)","m_box_office":"$1,132,112[1] | Valmont is a 1989 French-American drama film directed by Miloš Forman and starring Colin Firth, Annette Bening, and Meg Tilly.
