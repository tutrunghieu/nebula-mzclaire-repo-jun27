Captured along with his family and fiance Allegra in 1943 and interned in Auschwitz, Arouch is used by his SS captors as entertainment, forced to box against fellow prisoners. He knows that if he refuses, his family will be punished; if he wins, he will be given extra rations which he can share with them; if he loses, he will be sent to the gas chamber. As his family and friends die around him, he has only his love of Allegra and his grim determination to keep him alive. | The film follows the early life story of Salamo Arouch, though it takes some artistic liberties including the early introduction of wife Allegra (a pseudonym for Marta Yechiel), whom Arouch did not actually meet until after the liberation of the camp.[2][3]","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Young was reluctant to make the film when he was first approached with the script, finding the topic too momentous to cover; he only agreed to direct when provided a script that focused only on one small element, \"like a cork, bubbling on the surface of the sea.\"[2] The film, which positions Arouch as a witness to the horrors of the Holocaust, was shot on a budget of US $12 million.[2] Filming with permission at the Auschwitz concentration camp, producers were able to utilize some existing structures but were also tasked with recreating a crematory given the condition of those that remain.[2] The film also shot briefly in Israel.[4]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert M.
