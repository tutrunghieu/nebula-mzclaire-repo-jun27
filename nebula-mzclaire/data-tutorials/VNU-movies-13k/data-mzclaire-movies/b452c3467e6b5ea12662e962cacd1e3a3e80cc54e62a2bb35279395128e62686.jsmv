He said the film worked very effectively as a comment on the male psyche and how lethal the mix of fear and aggression can be when men have a need to prove their masculinity for reasons imagined or real.[4] Globe and Mail writer Jay Scott in an August 28, 1985 review called it a remarkable new thriller and a comic combination of Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Deliverance.[5] Peter Goddard of the Toronto Star wrote Winning’s sense of movement within a scene is already masterly. He could make ice melting seem exciting.[6] And Fred Haeseker in a November 1987 Calgary Herald review said it’s a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of time-honored shock effects and rite-of-passage clichés, seen with a sense of humor that is usually missing from the pictures that spawned them.[7]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Winning","m_produced_by":"David Winning","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"David Palffy Stan Kane Tom Schioler Harry Freedman Lawrence Elion Stacy Christensen","m_music_by":"Amin Bhatia","m_cinematography":"Tim Hollings","m_edited_by":"Bill Campbell","m_production_company":"Groundstar Entertainment","m_distributed_by":"Warner Home Video","m_release_dates":"1987 (1987) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"102 minutes","m_country":"Canada","m_language":"English | Storm is a 1987 Canadian drama film and first feature starring David Palffy and Stan Kane directed by David Winning.
