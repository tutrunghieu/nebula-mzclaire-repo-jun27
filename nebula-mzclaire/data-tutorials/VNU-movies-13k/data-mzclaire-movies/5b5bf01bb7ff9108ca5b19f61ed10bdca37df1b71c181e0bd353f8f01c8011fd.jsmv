{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film begins with a Broadway-style number \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\", sung by the dolphins of the world, who are aware of the Earth's impending doom. At the end, they all jump out of the oceans and into space, leaving Earth for good. | One Thursday morning, Arthur Dent discovers that his house is to be immediately demolished to make way for a bypass. He tries delaying the bulldozers by lying down in front of them. Ford Prefect, a friend of Arthur's, convinces him to go to the pub with him. Over a pint of beer (as \"muscle relaxant\"), Ford explains that he is an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and a journalist working on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a universal guide book, and that the Earth is to be demolished later that day by a race called Vogons, to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Suddenly, a Vogon Constructor Fleet appears in the sky and destroys the planet. Ford saves himself and Arthur by hitching a ride on a Vogon ship. The two are found and forced to listen to poetry. They are then thrown out of an airlock, but are picked up by the starship Heart of Gold. They find Ford's \"semi-cousin\" Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Galaxy. He has stolen the ship along with Tricia \"Trillian\" McMillan, an Earth woman whom Arthur had met previously, and Marvin the Paranoid Android, a clinically depressed robot that constantly complains about life. | Zaphod explains that he is seeking the planet Magrathea, where he believes he can discover the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything to match with the answer \"42\" given by the supercomputer Deep Thought. Zaphod stole the Heart of Gold to use its improbability drive to get to Magrathea through trial and error. | During one of these attempts, they end up on the planet Viltvodle VI. Zaphod decides to visit Humma Kavula, his opponent from the election. Upon learning of Zaphod's plan, Kavula announces that he has the coordinates to Magrathea. He takes one of Zaphod's two heads hostage and demands they bring him the Point-of-view gun created by Deep Thought, which allows the target to understand the shooter's point of view. As they are leaving the planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons. The others travel to rescue her from the Vogon home world bureaucracy, facing long lines and frustrating form processing. Trillian is outraged to learn that Zaphod signed the authorisation for the destruction of Earth thinking it was a request for an autograph. | The Heart of Gold is chased by the Vogons, led by Galactic Vice-President Questular Rontok, who is attempting to rescue Zaphod from himself, after an incident in which Zaphod kidnapped himself in order to forgo presidential duties. As the Heart of Gold arrives in orbit above Magrathea, Arthur triggers the improbability drive to avoid the automated missile defence systems. The missiles transform into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. | On the planet, Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian take a portal to Deep Thought. When they ask the computer whether it has calculated the ultimate question, it reveals that it designed another supercomputer to do so—Earth. When the trio finds the Point-of-View gun, Trillian shoots Zaphod, making him understand how she feels about the destruction of Earth. She also finds out how much she loves Arthur. Arthur and Marvin miss the portal and encounter a Magrathean called Slartibartfast, who takes Arthur on a tour of the construction floor where Earth Mark II is being built. Slartibartfast takes Arthur home, where the others are enjoying a feast provided by pan-dimensional beings who resemble a pair of mice. Arthur realises he has fallen into a trap. The mice, who constructed Deep Thought, used the supercomputer to build an even larger supercomputer, the planet Earth, to determine the Ultimate Question. Believing Arthur, the last remaining supercomputer component, may hold the Ultimate Question, the mice attempt to remove his brain. Arthur kills the mice. | As the crew regroup outside the house they are surrounded by Vogons and take shelter in a caravan as the Vogons open fire. Marvin is left outside and shot in the back of the head, and uses the Point-of-View gun on the Vogons, causing them to become depressed and unable to fight. As the Vogons are taken away and Questular rejoins with Zaphod, Arthur chooses to explore the galaxy with Trillian and lets Slartibartfast finalise the new Earth without him. The Heart of Gold crew decide to visit the Restaurant at the End of the Universe while Marvin points out they are going the wrong way.","m_cast":"Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent | Sam Rockwell as President Zaphod Beeblebrox | Mos Def as Ford Prefect | Zooey Deschanel as Tricia McMillan / Trillian | Warwick Davis as Marvin the Paranoid Android (in-suit performer) | Bill Nighy as Slartibartfast | Anna Chancellor as Vice-President Questular Rontok | John Malkovich as Humma Kavula | Kelly Macdonald as Jin Jenz Reporter | Jason Schwartzman (uncredited) as Gag Halfrunt | Edgar Wright (uncredited) as Deep Thought Tech | Simon Jones as Magrathea Video Recording |  | Sue Beattie | Danny Blackner as Vogons | Lynn Robertson Bruce | Simon Buckley | Hayley Burrows | Richard Coombs as Kwaltz (face performance) | Phil Eason as Vogons | Cecily Faye | Aron Freeman | Andy Heath | Brian Herring as Vogon Receptionist | Mark Jefferis | Ian Kay | Nikki McInnes | Rebecca Nagan | Mousen Nouri | Nigel Plaskitt as Vogon Councillor | Katherine Smee | William Todd-Jones as Vogon Jeltz (in-suit performer), Vogons | Rob Tygner | Mak Wilson as Vogon Jeltz (puppeteer) | Sarah Wright | Stephen Fry as Narrator, The Guide | Alan Rickman as Marvin the Paranoid Android | Ian McNeice as Qualtz | Helen Mirren as Deep Thought | Richard Griffiths as Vogon Jeltz | Thomas Lennon as Eddie the Computer | Bill Bailey as The Whale | Mak Wilson as Vogon Interpreter | Garth Jennings as Frankie Mouse (uncredited)","m_reception":"Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 194 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.1/10. The site's consensus reads: \"A frantic and occasional funny adaptation of Douglas Adams' novel. However, it may have those unfamiliar with the source material scratching their heads.\"[6] Metacritic gives it 63/100, indicating \"generally favourable\" reviews.[7] Empire magazine rated the film four stars out of five and said it was a \"very British, very funny sci-fi misadventure that's guaranteed to win converts\".[8] | Roger Ebert, gave the film two stars out of four, writing: | You will find the movie tiresomely twee, and notice that it obviously thinks it is being funny at times when you do not have the slightest clue why that should be. You will hear dialogue that preserves the content of written humor at the cost of sounding as if the characters are holding a Douglas Adams reading ... I do not get the joke. I do not much want to get the joke, but maybe you will ... To me it got old fairly quickly. The movie was more of a revue than a narrative, more about moments than an organising purpose.[9] | Manohla Dargis called it \"hugely likable\" with a story arc structured \"more or less\" as \"a long beginning and then an ending\"; she calls Henson's Creature Shop's Vogons \"beautifully constructed\" and noted that Sam Rockwell's performance is \"sensational, ... riffing on Elvis and the current President George Bush.\"[4] Peter Bradshaw gave the film three stars out of five and said, \"The film is no disgrace, and honours the Guide's gentle, low-tech BBC origins. But it doesn't do justice to the open-ended inventiveness of the original. The inevitable Anglo-American accommodations of casting have muddled its identity and the performances of the new American stars can be uneasy. It somehow seems heavier-footed and slower-moving than Adams's concept; the gravity is stronger.... The savour and flavour of the Adams original, its playfully ruminative feel, has been downgraded in favour of a jolly but less interesting outerspace romp.\"[10] | Philip French, after describing the Vogons as \"a species resembling Laughton's version of Quasimodo\" and writing it is \"not, except in its financing, anything resembling a standard Hollywood production\", called the film \"slightly old-fashioned (few things date as rapidly as science fiction and our view of the future) and somewhat commonplace through its embracing familiar special effects. The jokes have to compete with the hardware and the actors executing them often exude a feeling of desperation.... It's funnier, and obviously cleverer, than Spaceballs, Mel Brooks's puerile spoof on Star Wars, but a good bit less engaging than Galaxy Quest.\"[11] | The movie was released on 28 April 2005 in the UK making £4,200,000 in its first week. It was released a day later in North America, making $21,103,203 in its opening weekend, opening in first place. In the US, the movie remained in the box office top ten for its first four weeks of release. The movie's total box office gross was $104,478,416 worldwide.[2] | The movie was nominated for seven different awards and won one. It won the Golden Trailer Award under the category Most Original.[12] It was nominated for: the Artios award from Casting Society of America, USA under the category Best Featured Film Casting-Comedy in 2005; the Empire Awards from Empire Awards, UK under the categories Best British Film and Best Comedy in 2006; the Golden Trailer from Golden Trailer Awards under the category Best Voice Over; and Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Action/Adventure and Choice Rap Artist in a Movie: Mos Def.[13] | Martin Freeman confirmed to MTV Movie Blog in 2007 that a sequel was unlikely to happen, commenting, \"I found that out from the horse's mouth, [director] Garth Jennings. I had dinner with him and he said [the first one] just didn't do well enough.\"[14]","m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams","m_directed_by":"Garth Jennings","m_produced_by":"Gary Barber | Roger Birnbaum | Jonathan Glickman | Nick Goldsmith | Jay Roach","m_screenplay_by":"Douglas Adams | Karey Kirkpatrick","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Stephen Fry","m_music_by":"Joby Talbot","m_cinematography":"Igor Jadue-Lillo","m_edited_by":"Niven Howie","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Buena Vista Pictures","m_release_dates":"28 April 2005 (2005-04-28) (United Kingdom) | 29 April 2005 (2005-04-29) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"109 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom | United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$45–50 million[2][3]","m_box_office":"$104.5 million[2] | The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a 2005 British-American comic science fiction film directed by Garth Jennings, based upon previous works in the media franchise of the same name, created by Douglas Adams.
