{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Angus Flint (Peter Capaldi), a Scottish archaeology student excavating the site of a convent at the Derbyshire bed and breakfast run by the Trent sisters, Mary (Sammi Davis) and Eve (Catherine Oxenberg), unearths an unusual skull which appears to be that of a large snake. He believes it may be connected to the local legend of the d'Ampton 'worm', a mythical snake-like creature from ages past said to have been slain in Stonerich Cavern by John d'Ampton, the ancestor of current Lord of the Manor, James d'Ampton (Hugh Grant). | When the pocket watch of the Trent sisters' father, who disappeared a year earlier near Temple House, the stately home of the beautiful and seductive Lady Sylvia Marsh (Amanda Donohoe), is found miles away in Stonerich Cavern, James comes to believe that the creature may be more than a mere legend, dwelling deep beneath the cavern. | The enigmatic Lady Sylvia is in fact the immortal priestess to the ancient snake god, Dionin, which, as James correctly predicted, indeed survives, roaming the underground caves which connect Temple House with Stonerich Cavern. Lady Sylvia steals the skull and abducts Eve Trent, intending to offer her as the latest in a long line of sacrifices to her god. Before she can follow through with her evil actions, Angus, with the help of James, manages to rescue Eve and destroy both Sylvia and the worm. The two men are contaminated, however, and find themselves cursed to carry on the vampiric, snake-like condition.","m_cast":"Hugh Grant as Lord James D'Ampton | Amanda Donohoe as Lady Sylvia Marsh | Catherine Oxenberg as Eve Trent | Peter Capaldi as Angus Flint | Sammi Davis as Mary Trent | Stratford Johns as Peters | Paul Brooke as Ernie | Imogen Claire as Dorothy Trent | Chris Pitt as Kevin | Gina McKee as Nurse Gladwell | Christopher Gable as Joe Trent","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The movie was made as part of a four-picture deal Russell and producer Dan Ireland had with Vestron Pictures. 1986's Gothic had been a big success on video, and Vestron told Ireland that if Russell could come up with a horror movie, they would finance his planned prequel to Women in Love, The Rainbow. Ireland says that Russell originally wanted to cast Tilda Swinton, but she turned down the role, and Amanda Donohoe was cast instead.
