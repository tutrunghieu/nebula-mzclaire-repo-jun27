Film critic and historian Leonard Maltin considers this one of the worst films ever to appear in his popular \"TV, Movie and Video Guide\" (now simply \"Movie Guide\"): \"Deranged 'remake' lacks action, humor and charm; Forget about comparisons to Johnny Weismuller; O'Keefe makes Elmo Lincoln seem like Edwin Booth.\" Leslie Halliwell described Tarzan the Ape Man as \"certainly the worst of the Tarzan movies and possibly the most banal film so far made; even the animals give poor performances\".[3] In a discussion of Tarzan films, Thomas S. Hischak was also negative: \"Produced and directed without a shred of talent by John Derek, Tarzan, the Ape Man often ranks high in the lists of the worst movies ever made\".[4] | However, critic Roger Ebert offered a somewhat more positive review of Tarzan, the Ape Man, awarding it two and a half stars out of a possible four. According to Ebert, the film was \"completely ridiculous, but at the same time it has a certain disarming charm.\" Ebert thought Harris's talents were completely wasted and the film's dramatic peak was \"incomprehensible,\" yet he praised the forthright depiction of the sexual passion and tension between Tarzan and Jane, which had more typically been downplayed in film adaptations of the characters: \"The Tarzan-Jane scenes strike a blow for noble savages, for innocent lust, for animal magnetism, and, indeed, for soft-core porn, which is ever so much sexier than the hard-core variety.\"[5]","m_production":"In a 2012 interview with the film history magazine Filmfax, co-writer Gary Goddard revealed that he had originally been commissioned to write a screenplay for Bo Derek based upon the Marvel Comics superheroine, Dazzler; a 30-page treatment was completed before the project was cancelled and work instead proceeded on Tarzan, The Ape Man which initially carried the working title Me, Jane reflecting its focus on Jane Porter as a showcase for Derek.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Tarzan of the Apes  by Edgar Rice Burroughs","m_directed_by":"John Derek","m_produced_by":"Bo Derek","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Bo Derek Miles O'Keeffe Richard Harris John Phillip Law","m_music_by":"Perry Botkin Jr.","m_cinematography":"John Derek Wolfgang Dickmann","m_edited_by":"Jimmy Ling","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"August 7, 1981 (1981-08-07) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"107 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$6.5 million","m_box_office":"$36,565,280 | Tarzan, the Ape Man is a 1981 adventure film directed by John Derek and starring his wife Bo Derek, Miles O'Keeffe, Richard Harris, and John Phillip Law. The screenplay by Tom Rowe and Gary Goddard[1] is loosely based on the novel Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but from the point of view of Jane Parker. It is the final of three filmed versions of the story released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. | The original music score is composed by Perry Botkin Jr. Former Tarzan actor Jock Mahoney, billed as Jack O'Mahoney, was the film's stunt coordinator. The film is marketed with the tagline Unlike any other \"Tarzan\" you've ever seen! The original actor cast in the \"Tarzan\" role was fired [or quit] early in production, resulting in the sudden casting of his stunt double, Miles O'Keeffe, in the title role. This film received extremely negative reviews, and in some circles has been considered to be one of the worst films ever made, even though it was a box-office success. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Moore, David J.
