{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the 1890s, a group of \"Harvey Girls\" - new waitresses for Fred Harvey's pioneering chain of Harvey House restaurants - travels on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF) to the western town of Sandrock, Arizona. On the trip they meet Susan Bradley (Judy Garland), who travels to the same town to marry the man whose beautiful letters she received when she answered a \"lonely-hearts\" ad. Unfortunately, when she arrives, the man turns out to be an \"old coot\" who does not at all meet her expectations – and he also wants not to get married as much as she wants not to marry him, so they agree to call it off. When she learns that someone else, the owner of the local saloon, Ned Trent (John Hodiak), wrote the letters as a joke, she confronts him and tells him off, in the process endearing herself to him. | Then Susan joins the Harvey Girls, and she soon becomes their leader in fighting against the attempts by Trent's business associate, Judge Sam Purvis (Preston Foster), to scare them off – and against the animosity of the dance-hall girls and, apparently, prostitutes, led by Em (Angela Lansbury), who is in love with Trent, and who sees Susan as a rival. Trent visits to see the value of the Harvey House and other trappings of civilization, then he tells Purvis to leave them alone, but Purvis continues with his campaign of intimidation, finally burning down the restaurant. Trent offers his saloon as a replacement, and Em and the dance-hall girls leave town. Susan, thinking that Trent too is leaving, gets on the train, but Em, seeing that Susan loves Trent so much that she is willing to give up everything for him, stops the train and points out Trent, riding toward them on his horse. Ultimately, they are wedded in the desert, surrounded by the Harvey Girls.","m_cast":"Cast notes: | The role of \"Em\" was originally intended to be played by Ann Sothern, but because of her personal problems, it went instead to Angela Lansbury, her fourth film role.[3] Despite Lansbury having a good voice – she later became the star of the Broadway musicals Mame and Sweeney Todd – her voice was dubbed by Virginia Rees. | This was the first speaking role on film for Cyd Charisse. | Byron Harvey Jr., the grandson of Fred Harvey of the Fred Harvey Company, had an uncredited role as a train conductor. | The Harvey Girls was the first re-union on film for Ray Bolger and Judy Garland since 1939's The Wizard of Oz.[3]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Harvey Girls was conceived by MGM as a dramatic vehicle for Lana Turner, but Roger Edens, of the Arthur Freed unit, decided after seeing the musical Oklahoma! that the story should be reworked as MGM's western musical with Judy Garland as its star. Unfortunately, Garland wanted to work with Fred Astaire on Yolanda and the Thief, which was directed by fiance Vincente Minnelli. Edens convinced her that the part in Yolanda was not large enough for her, and he promised that The Harvey Girls would be specifically created to showcase her talents.[4] Ann Sothern and Lucille Ball were slated to have roles in the film, and Edward Arnold was scheduled to play the role of Judge Purvis.[5] | The Harvey Girls filmed from January 12 through June 4, 1945,[6] a long production period. Studio filming was at MGM's Culver City studios, and location shooting took place in Victorville, California; at the Iverson Ranch in Chatsworth (near Los Angeles); and in Monument Valley.[5][7] | Although Angela Lansbury was a fine singer, her voice was considered unsuitable for her character, a low-class saloon singer. Virginia Rees provided Lansbury's singing voice. Cyd Charisse, who had her first speaking role in the film, also had her singing dubbed by Marion Doenges.[8] | Virginia O'Brien, a comic actress known for her deadpan style of singing, was pregnant while The Harvey Girls was filmed. Several scenes with Ray Bolger were never filmed due to the difficulty in hiding her pregnancy. This accounts for O'Brien's character disappearing after O'Brien sings \"Wild Wild West\".[5] Bolger also sustained a burn injury by steam during the filming of \"On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe\".[citation needed] | The Harvey Girls was released in the U.S. on January 18, 1946. | Production credits:","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Harvey Girls 1942 novel  by Samuel Hopkins Adams","m_directed_by":"George Sidney Robert Alton (musical number)","m_produced_by":"Arthur Freed","m_screenplay_by":"Edmund Beloin Nathaniel Curtis Harry Crane James O'Hanlon Samson Raphaelson","m_story_by":"Eleanore Griffin William Rankin","m_starring":"Judy Garland","m_music_by":"Harry Warren (music) Johnny Mercer (lyrics) Lennie Hayton (score)","m_cinematography":"George J.
