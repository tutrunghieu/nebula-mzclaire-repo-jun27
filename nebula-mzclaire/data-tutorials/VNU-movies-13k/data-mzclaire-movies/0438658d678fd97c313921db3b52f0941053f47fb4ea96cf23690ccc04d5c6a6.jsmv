{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. | Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. | At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. | Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also offers Martin a job: repair his father's Telepods. He apologizes about the Golden Retriever and assures Martin that its suffering was brief. When Martin is uneasy about the proposition, and Bartok shows him Veronica Quaife's videotapes, which documented Seth Brundle's progress with the Telepods. Seeing his late father describe how the Telepods ostensibly improved and energized his body, Martin accepts Bartok's proposal. | As he begins work on the Telepods, Martin befriends an employee, Beth Logan, and they grow closer. Beth invites Martin to a party at the specimens division, where he overhears some scientists and learns that the mutated Golden Retriever is still kept alive and studied. Thinking Beth is aware of the dog's imprisonment, Martin argues with her, leaves the party, and goes to the animal's holding pen. The deformed dog, in terrible pain, still remembers Martin, and he tearfully euthanizes it with chloroform. Martin reconciles with Beth, and rearrives at his father's \"eureka\" moment when he realizes the Telepod's computer need to be creative to analyze living flesh. Martin then shows Beth his perfected Telepods by teleporting a kitten without harm. They become lovers, but Martin begins showing signs of his eventual mutation into a human-fly hybrid. Martin devises a potential cure for his condition, which involves swapping out his mutated genes for healthy human genes. Martin shelves this idea when he realizes the other person would be subject to a grotesque genetic disfigurement. | Eventually, Martin learns that Bartok has hidden cameras in his bungalow, and has been lying to him for his entire life. Martin breaks into Bartok's records room, where he learns of his father's true fate. Bartok confronts Martin and explains that he's been waiting for his inevitable mutation. He reveals his plan to use Martin's body and the Telepods' potential for genetic manipulation for profit. Martin's dormant insect genes fully awakens, and his transformation into a human-insect hybrid begins. He escapes from Bartok Industries. Bartok is unable to use the Telepods, as it is locked by a password. Martin also installed a computer virus which will erase the Telepods' programming if the wrong \"magic word\" is entered. Bartok orders a search for Martin. | Martin goes to Beth, explains the situation, and the two flee. They visit Veronica Quaife's old confidant, Stathis Borans, who is now a reclusive, embittered drunk after her death. Borans confirms for Martin that the Telepods are his only chance for a cure. They keep running, but Martin's physical and emotional changes become too much for Beth to handle, and she eventually surrenders them both to Bartok. Without revealing the password, he becomes fully enveloped in a cocoon and enters the final stages of his transformation. Bartok interrogates Beth for the \"magic word.\" Shortly after, the fully transformed \"Martinfly\" emerges from his cocoon and indiscriminately kills the scientists and security guards. A trace of his humanity remains, as shown when he doesn't harm a rottweiler. | Martinfly breaks into Bay 17. He grabs Bartok and forces him to type in the password (revealed to be \"DAD\"). He then drags Bartok and himself into a Telepod. Martinfly gestures Beth to activate the gene-swapping sequence and, despite Bartok's protests, Beth complies. Martin is restored to a fully human form, while Bartok is transformed into a freakish monster that can barely crawl around. | The Bartok-creature is placed in a specimen pit similar to the one he had kept the mutated dog. In the final shot of the film, as it leans down to feed from a bowl, it notices a housefly.","m_cast":"Eric Stoltz as Martin Brundle Sterling Cottingham as baby Martin (newborn} Rodney Clough Jr. as Martin Brundle (1 1/2 years old) Matthew Moore as 4-year old Martin Harley Cross as Martin Brundle (age 10) | Daphne Zuniga as Beth Logan | Lee Richardson as Anton Bartok | John Getz as Stathis Borans | Frank C.

Many believe that Walas (who was the special effects engineer for the Oscar-winning make-up and creature effects in the first film) set out to repeat the success of the original by relying more on heavy gore and violence than on plot and atmosphere. However, it is appreciated by many fans of the horror genre for its great visual impact. Walas has stated that the film was designed to be much more of a traditional (albeit gory) monster movie than Cronenberg's horror/tragic love film. | The scene of a character's head being crushed by an elevator aroused some controversy with the MPAA: they originally gave the film an \"X\" rating due to its graphic nature. Ultimately Chris Walas was able to gain a more audience friendly \"R\" rating after reediting the sequence. The VHS and DVD versions retain the full scene. | The film received a certain amount of backlash regarding the 'mutant' dog, in particular, the scene where Martin mercifully euthanizes the dog, which is hideously deformed and kept in a large observation room. Many viewers were disturbed by the dog's appearance and sad fate as mentioned by Chris Walas in the documentary for the Special Edition DVD. He said the audience would feel more sympathy for a mutated animal than a human. | The Fly II holds a 27% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes from a sample of 15 critics.[2]","m_production":"The following are events related to film production: | An early treatment for a sequel to The Fly, written by Tim Lucas, involved Veronica Quaife dealing with the evils of the Bartok company. Seth Brundle's consciousness had somehow survived within the Telepod computer, and the Bartok scientists had enslaved him and were using him to develop the system for cloning purposes. Brundle becomes able to communicate with Veronica through the computer, and he eventually takes control of the Bartok complex's security systems to gruesomely attack the villains. Eventually, Veronica frees Brundle by conspiring with him to reintegrate a non-contaminated version of his original body. David Cronenberg endorsed this concept at the time. Geena Davis was open to doing a sequel (and only pulled out of Fly II because her character was to be killed in the opening scene), while Goldblum was not (although he was okay with a cameo), and this treatment reflects that. However, a later treatment written by Jim and Ken Wheat was used as the basis for the final script, written by Frank Darabont. Mick Garris also wrote a treatment, with elements incorporated into the final film. | The first videotape of Seth Brundle is actually part of a deleted scene from the first film (with Geena Davis' dialogue redubbed by Saffron Henderson, who played Veronica Quaife at the beginning of the sequel). | The film contains a subtle reference to David Cronenberg, writer-director of the previous film. In an early scene where Martin sneaks out of his room to explore the Bartok Industries facility, a guard is seen asleep at his post, and resting on the desk in front of him is a copy of The Shape of Rage, a book which discusses the films of David Cronenberg (and the book's cover features a photo of Cronenberg himself). | The script for The Fly II explained that Stathis Borans lived in such a fancy home because he had taken hush money from Bartok (and had been told that Brundle's baby died in childbirth along with Veronica), but this was never mentioned on-screen. In an early treatment for The Fly II, it was revealed that the Telepods were not working because Stathis had taken the computer's information storage discs (which contained the Telepods' programming) before Bartok took possession of the pods. However, this detail was dropped from the final film, and it is left unclear as to why the Telepods suddenly aren't working at the beginning of the sequel. The implication is that the Telepods were completely reassembled according to Seth Brundle's design plans; but that the specific programming, enabling it to teleport live subjects, had been lost. | Chris Walas mentioned on the DVD documentary that he was very displeased with the marketing of the film as he warned them not to use the \"Like Father, Like Son\" tagline as it sounded too \"corny.\" The marketing executives still went ahead with the tagline. Producer Steven Charles-Jaffe says that he hates the marketing process as it could kill a movie with too much hype. | On the DVD commentary track, the film's director, Chris Walas, states his belief that screenwriter Frank Darabont wrote Bartok to represent the worst aspects of corporate America.","m_sequel":"Beginning in March 2015, IDW Publishing released a five-issue comic book miniseries titled The Fly: Outbreak, written by Brandon Seifert.[3] The story is a direct sequel to the events of The Fly II, and features Martin Brundle inadvertently causing a transgenic outbreak while attempting to cure Anton Bartok, to whom he'd previously transferred his mutant genes.","m_based_on":"Characters  by George Langelaan","m_directed_by":"Chris Walas","m_produced_by":"Steven-Charles Jaffe Mel Brooks (uncredited)","m_screenplay_by":"Mick Garris Jim Wheat Ken Wheat Frank Darabont","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Eric Stoltz | Daphne Zuniga | Lee Richardson | Harley Cross | John Getz","m_music_by":"Christopher Young","m_cinematography":"Robin Vidgeon","m_edited_by":"Sean Barton","m_production_company":"Brooksfilms","m_distributed_by":"20th Century Fox","m_release_dates":"February 10, 1989 (1989-02-10) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"105 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$38.9 million[1] | The Fly II is a 1989 science fiction horror film starring Eric Stoltz and Daphne Zuniga.
