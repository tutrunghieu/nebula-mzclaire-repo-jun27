{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Jack Lemmon stars as the playboy landlord Hogan, a swinging bachelor. Women are mere playthings to him, plus he's a master con man. His bachelor pad is a holy temple of seduction: blood-red walls, African sculptures, a well-stocked cocktail bar, a switch-operated fireplace, and mechanized violins that play romantic music at the touch of a button. He walks around wearing a scarlet cardigan (with matching socks and shirts) and a devilish smirk. As the landlord of a Californian apartment block, he only rents rooms to gorgeous single women at just $75 a month. | The film begins as Irene (Adams), a recently divorced tenant, has just concluded a relationship with Hogan. She's moving out of the apartment with the assistance of her friend Charles (Lansing). It is immediately snapped up by her naive niece, Robin (Lynley). Hogan is thrilled at the prospect of yet another beautiful tenant to seduce, but is initially unaware that Robin's short-tempered, frustrated, bumbling boyfriend David (Jones) is moving in with her—but in a 'platonic' capacity only, to determine their compatibility. | Temptation is naturally there, but Hogan does his best to prevent David and Robin from consummating their relationship. Irene, who has only lately come to realize the extent of Hogan's promiscuity, is determined to prevent him from getting his hands on her niece. Irene confronts him at his barber, and Hogan is self-defensive and self-deluded to comic effect. | An older married couple, handyman Murphy (Lynde) and maid Dorcas (Coca) work for Hogan, he the stereotypical harried husband, she the stereotypical loud and overbearing wife. | Irene's counsel/advice (about 'what love is') to the young couple at the end of the film is particularly moving, when considering Edie Adams had lost her real-life husband, Ernie Kovacs, the previous year.","m_cast":"Jack Lemmon as Hogan | Carol Lynley as Robin Austin | Dean Jones as David Manning | Edie Adams as Irene Wilson | Paul Lynde as Murphy | Robert Lansing as Charles Howard | Imogene Coca as Dorcas Murphy | Joy Harmon as Ardice | Pamela Curran as Dolores | Asa Maynor as Cheryl | Laurie Sibbald as Eve | Jane Wald as Liz (woman in shower) | Celeste Yarnall as New Girl in Van | Bill Bixby as Track Team Coach | Bill Erwin as Teacher | Matty Jordan as Maitre D' | James Millhollin as The Thin Man","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"David Swift","m_produced_by":"David Swift","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Jack Lemmon Carol Lynley Dean Jones Edie Adams Paul Lynde Imogene Coca Robert Lansing","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":null,"m_edited_by":null,"m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures","m_release_dates":"1963 (1963) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"110 mins","m_country":null,"m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$5 million (US/ Canada rentals) [1] | Under the Yum Yum Tree is a 1963 comedy movie that stars Jack Lemmon, Carol Lynley, Dean Jones, and Edie Adams, with supporting roles by Imogene Coca and Paul Lynde. | This sex comedy was a successful small comic movie that gained Lemmon a Golden Globe nomination.
