{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Growing up, Evan Treborn and his friends, Lenny and siblings Kayleigh and Tommy Miller, suffered many severe psychological traumas that frequently caused him to black out. These traumas include being coerced to take part in child pornography by Kayleigh and Tommy's father, George Miller (Eric Stoltz), being nearly strangled to death by his institutionalized father, Jason Treborn (Callum Keith Rennie), who is then killed in front of him by guards; accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with dynamite with his friends; and seeing his dog being burned alive by Tommy. | Seven years later, while entertaining a girl in his dorm room, Evan discovers that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he can travel back in time and redo parts of his past. His time traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced as a child, since those are the moments that his adult self occupied his conscious, such as the moment his father strangled him when he realizes that Evan shares his time-traveling affliction. However, there are consequences to his revised choices that dramatically alter his present life. For example, his personal time-line leads to alternative futures in which he finds himself, variously, as a college student in a fraternity, an inmate imprisoned for murdering Tommy, and a double amputee. Eventually, he realizes that, even though his intentions to fix the past are good, his actions have unforeseen consequences, in which either he or at least one of his friends does not benefit. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternative timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. He ultimately reaches the conclusion that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps trying to fix the past, and he realizes that the only thing keeping his friends from having good lives is himself. | Evan travels back one final time to the day he first met Kayleigh as a child. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy will choose to live with their mother, in a different neighborhood, instead of with their father when they divorce. As a result, they aren't subjected to a destructive upbringing, don't grow up with Evan, and go on to have happy, successful lives. Evan awakens in a college dorm room, where Lenny is his roommate. As a test, he asks where Kayleigh is, to which Lenny responds \"Who's Kayleigh?\" Knowing that everything is all right this time, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the timeline ever again. | Eight years later in New York City, an adult Evan exits an office building and passes by Kayleigh on the street. Though a brief look of recognition passes over both of their faces, they both decide to keep walking.","m_cast":"Ashton Kutcher as Evan Treborn John Patrick Amedori as Evan, age 13 Logan Lerman as Evan, age 7 | Amy Smart as Kayleigh Miller Irene Gorovaia as Kayleigh, age 13 Sarah Widdows as Kayleigh, age 7 | Elden Henson as Lenny Kagan Kevin G.

The site's consensus reads: \"The premise is intriguing, but it's placed in the service of an overwrought and tasteless thriller.\"[4] On Metacritic, another review aggregator, it has a score of 30 out of 100, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[5] | Roger Ebert wrote that he \"enjoyed The Butterfly Effect, up to a point\" and that the \"plot provides a showcase for acting talent, since the actors have to play characters who go through wild swings.\" However, Ebert said that the scientific notion of the butterfly effect is used inconsistently: Evan's changes should have wider reverberations.[6] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it a \"metaphysical mess\", criticizing the film's mechanics for being \"fuzzy at best and just plain sloppy the rest of the time\".[7] Mike Clark of USA Today also gave the film a negative review, stating, \"Normally, such a premise comes off as either intriguing or silly, but the morbid subplots (there's prison sex, too) prevent Effect from becoming the unintentional howler it might otherwise be.\"[8] Additionally, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe went as far as saying, \"whatever train-wreck pleasures you might locate here are spoiled by the vile acts the characters commit.\"[9] | Matt Soergel of The Florida Times-Union rated it 3 stars out of 4, writing, \"The Butterfly Effect is preposterous, feverish, creepy and stars Ashton Kutcher in a dramatic role. It's a blast... a solidly entertaining B-movie. It's even quite funny at times...\"[10] The Miami Herald said, \"The Butterfly Effect is better than you might expect despite its awkward, slow beginning, drawing you in gradually and paying off in surprisingly effective and bittersweet ways,\" and added that Kutcher is \"appealing and believable... The Butterfly Effect sticks to its rules fairly well... overall the film is consistent in its flights of fancy.\"[11] The Worcester Telegram & Gazette praised it as \"a disturbing film\" and \"the first really interesting film of 2004,\" adding that Kutcher \"carries it off\": | Written and directed by Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, who co-wrote Final Destination 2, this is much more intelligent than their earlier film would suggest... The Butterfly Effect may be a little too unconventional to succeed with a mass audience, but filmgoers claiming they want 'something different' from Hollywood ought to take note.[12] | In a retrospective, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that critics, including himself, were too harsh on the film at the time of its release. Describing the film as having been patronized, Bradshaw cited critical disdain for Kutcher as making the film uncool to like.[3] | Despite the critical failure, the film was a commercial success, earning $17,065,227 and claiming the #1 spot in its opening weekend.[13] Against a $13 million budget, The Butterfly Effect grossed around $57,938,693 at the U.S. box office and $96,060,858 worldwide.[1] | Best Science Fiction Film - nominated | Pegasus Audience Award — Eric Bress, J.

Mackye Gruber, starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. The title refers to the butterfly effect, a popular hypothetical example of chaos theory which illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time. | Kutcher plays 20-year-old college student Evan Treborn,[2] with Amy Smart as his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh Miller, William Lee Scott as her sadistic brother Tommy, and Elden Henson as their neighbor Lenny. Evan finds he has the ability to travel back in time to inhabit his former self (that is, his adult mind inhabits his younger body) and to change the present by changing his past behaviors. Having been the victim of several childhood traumas aggravated by stress-induced memory losses, he attempts to set things right for himself and his friends, but there are unintended consequences for all. The film draws heavily on flashbacks of the characters' lives at ages 7 and 13, and presents several alternate present-day outcomes as Evan attempts to change the past, before settling on a final outcome. | The film received a poor critical reception, but was nevertheless a commercial success, producing gross earnings of $96 million from a budget of $13 million. The film won the Pegasus Audience Award at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at the Saturn Awards and Choice Movie: Thriller in the Teen Choice Awards. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c The Butterfly Effect at Box Office Mojo | ^ Gruber, J.
