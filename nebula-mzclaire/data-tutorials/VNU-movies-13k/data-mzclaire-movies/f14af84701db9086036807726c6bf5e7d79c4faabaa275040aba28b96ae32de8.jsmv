The movie is loosely based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel Tarzan of the Apes, and is a remake of the classic 1932 film of the same name. The movie was directed by Joseph M. Newman, and the score was composed by jazz musician Shorty Rogers. MGM would release another remake of the film in 1981. | A fair amount of footage was taken directly from the 1932 version rather than being reshot, including scenes of Tarzan swinging on vines and the elephants' destruction of a pygmy village. A scene of Tarzan fighting a crocodile was reused from Tarzan and His Mate, the sequel to the 1932 film. Other footage was reused from King Solomon's Mines. Tarzan's distinctive call was also taken from the original version. The \"African\"\" elephants in some scenes are clearly Indian ones with some sort of canvas \"ears\" added, and with the characteristic double humps on the forehead all too obvious. The \"jungle\" vegetation, from three different continents, and the clumsy back-projection in the \"underwater\" scenes make it a treat for lovers of the ludicrous. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c The Eddie Mannix Ledger, Los Angeles: Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study .","m_external_link":"Tarzan, the Ape Man at the Internet Movie Database | Tarzan, the Ape Man at the Internet Movie Database","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/19/Tarzan_the_Ape_Man_%281959_film%29.jpg/220px-Tarzan_the_Ape_Man_%281959_film%29.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (character) Robert Hill (screenplay)"}
