His love scenes with the dazzling Tomei have an uncommon delicacy\".[9] In his review for The New Yorker, Anthony Lane praised Tomei for bringing \"startling high spirits to a dullish role. She snatches moments of happiness out of the air and shares them out to anyone who’s around\".[10] Mike Clark, in his review for USA Today, wrote, \"Director Tony Bill (My Bodyguard) is adept both in the yarn's meticulous buildup and in his handling of the actors\".[11]","m_production":"Tony Bill discovered Tom Sierchio's screenplay for Untamed Heart during one of his talent hunts. He asked an agent at William Morris to send him screenplays from new writers. Originally, Sierchio's screenplay had been submitted as a writer’s sample. Bill showed the screenplay to producer Helen Bartlett who suggested that they option it. Within two weeks of Sierchio handing his script to his agent, MGM had greenlighted the project. Originally the film was entitled The Baboon Heart in honor of an infant named Baby Fae (born 14 October 1984) who received a cross-species heart transplant from a baboon to fix a congenital heart defect. | Initially, Bill had not considered Christian Slater for the role of Adam, “but then it was just the obvious choice.\"[3] | For the role of Caroline, Bill remembered auditioning Marisa Tomei for his earlier film, Five Corners. She had been too young for that role but after her success with My Cousin Vinny, he knew she was right for this film. Sierchio's screenplay was originally set in New Jersey but for logistical reasons they could not shoot there. The filmmakers considered finding a location to double for the state but while Bill, Bartlett, and Sierchio were scouting in Minneapolis, they realized that it was the perfect place because of its strong acting community (they cast 35 of the film’s 40 roles from it) and a large commercial production community which allowed them to utilize a mostly local crew. | The city’s locations were also a strong factor in deciding to shoot there. The centerpiece was Jim’s Coffee Shop & Bakery, which actually existed at the time of production but was closed to the public for the duration of shooting the film. Bill said, “It had a wonderful combination of ingredients from every diner you’ve ever been to; we’ve done very little to change it for the film. In fact, we changed the original name of the diner in the script to reflect that it is Jim's.\"[4] | Principal photography began in March 1992 amidst cold temperatures. However, several scenes in winter were shot in May and fake snow had to be created to maintain the illusion. One scene was shot at the Met Center, the home of the Minnesota North Stars at the time. Tomei wanted to have a believable regional accent and chose a driver, Craig Kittelson, who was from the area and could act as her dialogue coach.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tony Bill","m_produced_by":"Tony Bill | Helen Buck Bartlett","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Marisa Tomei | Christian Slater | Rosie Perez","m_music_by":"Cliff Eidelman","m_cinematography":"Jost Vacano","m_edited_by":"Mia Goldman","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","m_release_dates":"February 12, 1993 (1993-02-12) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"102 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$6 million[1]","m_box_office":"$19 million (US)[2] | Untamed Heart is a 1993 American romantic drama film starring Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei.
