{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Former gymnastics Bronze Medalist Hope Annabelle Greggory (Melissa Rauch) has been living off her celebrity status in her hometown of Amherst, Ohio, to the point of getting free meals and going through the mail her post-office father delivers for spending money. When her former coach Pavleck (Christine Abrahamsen) suddenly commits suicide, a letter arrives addressed to Hope stating that if she can guide Pavleck's best student, a young gymnastics star named Maggie Townsend (Haley Lu Richardson) to the Olympics in Toronto, she will receive a $500,000 inheritance. | Unwilling to be overshadowed by Maggie's success, Hope instead plans to take the money but sabotage Maggie's training so she can stay on top, initially feeding her excessive junk food and a shake laced with marijuana. She performs so poorly that arrogant Olympic Gold Medalist Lance Tucker (Sebastian Stan), who resents Hope's celebrity on account of her inferior bronze medal (which she won despite a career-ending injury) threatens to take over as Maggie's coach. When she learns she will forfeit the inheritance money if she doesn't continue training Maggie, Hope convinces Maggie's mother to let Maggie stay with her and grudgingly devotes herself to Maggie's training. Along the way, she enters a romance with her assistant coach Ben Lawfort (Thomas Middleditch), nicknamed \"Twitchy\" due to his compulsive blinking habit. | Hope's efforts eventually pay off when Maggie qualifies for the Olympic Games. However, she is shocked to discover that Coach Pavleck's gym is in danger of closing because Pavleck had no money to her name when she died. Upon hearing the news, Hope's father confesses that he was the one who had written the letter, to motivate Hope to do something meaningful with her life. After a heated exchange, Hope gets drunk and ends up having sex with Lance Tucker, leading a heartbroken Ben who witnessed the act to break off their relationship. | Maggie succeeds in winning the gold medal and is celebrated as a local hero in Amherst, but announces her intention to begin training with Lance in Los Angeles instead of staying with Hope. When Maggie fails to show up for an autograph signing at the mall, Hope addresses the disappointed crowd and declares that she will always be Amherst's hero. She comes up with a plan to finance Pavleck's gym on her own by selling uniforms and gymnastics lessons to local girls. She then apologizes to Ben and retains him as her assistant coach. In the end, a caption reveals that Maggie was forced to abandon her gymnastics career after becoming pregnant with Lance's child.","m_cast":"Melissa Rauch as Hope Ann Greggory | Ellery Sprayberry as Young Hope | Gary Cole as Stan Greggory | Thomas Middleditch as Ben Lawfort | Sebastian Stan as Lance Tucker | Cecily Strong as Janice Townsend | Haley Lu Richardson as Maggie Townsend | Dale Raoul as Doris | Michael Shamus Wiles as Davey | Christine Abrahamsen as Coach Pavleck","m_reception":"On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 32%, based on 84 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10.
