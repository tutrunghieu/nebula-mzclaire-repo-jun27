{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In the early 16th century, a young boy helplessly witnesses his father's death at the hands of Kabai Sengh the ruthless leader of the Sengh brotherhood who attacked their ship. The boy jumps overboard and is washed ashore on an island called Bengalla where he is found by tribesmen who take him to their village. There he is given the Skull Ring and swears to devote his life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty and injustice. In adulthood, he adopts the identity of \"The Phantom\", a masked avenger. The role of The Phantom is passed on from father to son through centuries, leading people to believe in a single, immortal figure and accordingly nickname him \"The Ghost Who Walks\" and \"The Man Who Never Dies\". | In 1938, Kit Walker (Billy Zane), the 21st Phantom, finds a mercenary group led by a man named Quill (James Remar) searching in the jungle for one of the Skulls of Touganda, possession of which grants the owner a tremendous destructive power. The Phantom saves the native boy they had kidnapped as their guide and captures Quill's men leaving them to be picked up by the jungle patrol, while Quill himself escapes after wounding the Phantom with a knife. Quill—revealed as a member of the Sengh Brotherhood, and the man who killed Kit's father (Patrick McGoohan) -- flees with the Skull and returns to the United States. | In New York City, Kit's ex-girlfriend from college, Diana Palmer (Kristy Swanson), is a frequent traveler whose Uncle Dave (Bill Smitrovich), is the famous owner of \"The Tribune\" newspaper which has been investigating the power-hungry business man called Xander Drax (Treat Williams) a shady character with a noted reputation for having dealings with criminals. Uncle Dave has managed to uncover Xander Drax is connected to a mysterious spider web symbol which he traces back to the Bengalla Jungle, Diana is sent by him to investigate. En route, the Pan American World Airways Pan Am Clipper is forced down over the ocean by female air pirates employed by Drax and led by the femme fatale, Sala (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Diana is kidnapped and taken to their base on the harbor water front of Bengalla. Having been informed of Diana's kidnapping by the Jungle Patrol's captain Phillip Horton (Robert Coleby), The Phantom rescues Diana and escapes from Quill and his men to his headquarters, the Skull Cave (with the help of his white horse Hero, his pet wolf Devil, and his jungle friends the Rope People). There, Diana meets with Horton where she is informed by The Phantom and Horton that she is mixed up with the Sengh Brotherhood. The Phantom tells Horton to use the Jungle Patrol to take care of Diana and return her to New York while he goes after the Brotherhood. Diana starts to argue about being sent home, but The Phantom disappears deep into the Skull Cave, with Horton telling Diana that \"No one argues with The Phantom and wins\". | Back in New York, Kit now dressed as his civilian self meets with Dave Palmer at the Tribune building and once again meets with Diana who has mixed feelings about him since his sudden disappearance from her life several years before. Diana's would-be suitor Jimmy Wells, mentions he had seen one of the skulls they are discussing in the Museum of Natural History and Kit and Diana hurry there and are captured by Drax and his men, who steal the second Skull from and unite it with the first, revealing the location of the third Skull on an uncharted island known as the Devil's Vortex on the Yellow Sea. Kit seeing his fathers old skull belt buckled around Quills waist relaises he is fathers killer and manages to escape from him and his henchmen and, as The Phantom, evades the police outside the museum (Drax is allies in crime with New York's corrupt police commissioner who Dave Palmer had told him of Diana’s trip). Meanwhile, Sala flies Drax, Quill and Diana (Drax's \"Phantom insurance\" after it is revealed she is his girlfriend) to the Devil's Vortex, not knowing that The Phantom has managed to hitch a ride on one of the plane's landing pontoons. | On the island, Drax meets with the pirate Kabai Sengh (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a descendant of the Brotherhood's original leader, who possesses the third Skull. Sengh warns Drax of the existence of a \"Fourth Skull\", which controls the power of the other three. The Phantom appears and battles both men, with Kabai Sengh killed by his own pool of sharks, as Diana and Sala cooperate to defeat the other villains. Drax unites the three Skulls and turns them against the Phantom (inadvertently killing Quill in the process when he is caught in its beam), The Phantom uses the Fourth Skull—his own ring—to overcome the others and destroy both them and Drax in a powerful explosion. As the island is destroyed, The Phantom narrowly escapes with Diana and Sala. | In Bengalla once again, Diana reveals to the Phantom she has figured out his secret and his double-identity, The Phantom removes his mask, telling her that he is only allowed to reveal all of his secrets to one person, the woman he intends to marry, but she leaves again for New York. Kit's father laments his son's failure to pursue Diana, but states that she will return to The Phantom's jungle, and to Kit, one day.","m_cast":"Billy Zane as The Phantom / Kit Walker | Treat Williams as Xander Drax | Kristy Swanson as Diana Palmer | Catherine Zeta-Jones as Sala | James Remar as Quill | Patrick McGoohan as The Phantom's Father (The 20th Phantom) | Radmar Agana Jao as Guran | Robert Coleby as Captain Philip Horton | Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as The Great Kabai Sengh | Bill Smitrovich as Dave Palmer | Casey Siemaszko as Morgan | David Proval as Charlie Zephro | Joseph Ragno as Ray Zephro | Al Ruscio as Police Commissioner Farley | Samantha Eggar as Lily Palmer | Jon Tenney as Jimmy Wells | John Capodice as Al the Cabby","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Rumours of a Phantom movie adaptation had first started to circulate when director Sergio Leone expressed his interest in the property in an interview. Leone had started to write a script and scout locations for his proposed film version of the Phantom, which he planned to be followed by an adaptation of Lee Falk's other comic-strip hero, Mandrake the Magician.[3] The second project was never finalized. | Joe Dante was originally attached to direct a Phantom film for Paramount Pictures in the early 1990s, and he developed a draft of the script together with Jeffrey Boam. Dante and Boam's script was originally tongue-in-cheek in tone and the climax included a winged demon. However, when Paramount pushed the film back a year, Dante left for other commitments, and eventually ended up being credited as one of the executive producers. According to Dante: | I developed the script with the late Jeff Boam, who wrote Innerspace, as a kind of a spoof. We were a few weeks away from shooting in Australia when the plug was pulled over the budget and the presence of a winged demon at the climax. A year or so later it was put back into production - sans demon - only nobody seemed to notice it was written to be funny, so it was – disastrously - played straight. Many unintentionally funny moments were cut after a raucous test screening and I foolishly refused money to take my name off the picture, so I'm credited as one of a zillion producers.[4] | Joel Schumacher was considered to direct the film, but the job was given to Simon Wincer, who had been a fan of the character since childhood.[5] When he traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Paramount executives, he discovered that they intended to release the film in July 1996.[5] The Phantom was originally intended to be filmed in Hawaii, and the production schedule would go over budget by $10 million. However, Wincer decided to film it in New York City, Thailand and his native Australia, reducing the budget by $12 million as a result.[5] | Wincer then cast Billy Zane, who had won praise for his work as a psychopath in Dead Calm, as the Phantom. Zane, a huge fan of the comic strip after being introduced to it on the set of Dead Calm,[6] won the part after competition from Bruce Campbell and New Zealand actor Kevin Smith. After his casting, he spent over a year and a half to get the right muscular look of the Phantom. He also studied the character's body language in comic strip artwork, carefully imitating it in his performance.[7] A Batman-like costume displaying false muscles was made for him to wear; but by the time filming started, Zane did not need it. | The special Phantom costume effects were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Phantom  by Lee Falk","m_directed_by":"Simon Wincer","m_produced_by":"Alan Ladd, Jr. Robert Evans","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Patrick McGoohan","m_music_by":"David Newman","m_cinematography":"David Burr","m_edited_by":"O.
