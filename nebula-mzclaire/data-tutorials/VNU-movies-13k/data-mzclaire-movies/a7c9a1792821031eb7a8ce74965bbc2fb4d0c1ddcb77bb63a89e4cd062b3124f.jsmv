Women in the WLA were nicknamed \"land girls\". | Set in 1941 in the Dorset countryside, three \"land girls\" arrive on a remote farm. They are an unlikely trio: hairdresser Prue (Anna Friel) is vivacious and sexy, Cambridge University graduate Ag (Rachel Weisz) is quiet and more reserved, and dreamy Stella (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Philip, a dashing Royal Navy officer. Despite their differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war.","m_cast":"Catherine McCormack as Stella | Rachel Weisz as Ag (Agapanthus) | Anna Friel as Prue (Prudence) | Steven Mackintosh as Joe Lawrence | Tom Georgeson as Mr Lawrence | Maureen O'Brien as Mrs Lawrence | Lucy Akhurst as Janet | Gerald Down as Ratty, Lawrence Farm Hand | Paul Bettany as Philip","m_reception":"The film holds a 61% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.[3]","m_production":"Filming locations included the scenic Exmoor National Park, Crowcombe Heathfield station on the West Somerset Railway and Dulverton.[1] | The film cost £6 million.[2]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Land Girls by Angela Huth","m_directed_by":"David Leland","m_produced_by":"Ruth Jackson Simon Relph Andrew Warren","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Catherine McCormack Rachel Weisz Anna Friel","m_music_by":"Brian Lock","m_cinematography":"Henry Braham","m_edited_by":"Nick Moore","m_production_company":"PolyGram Filmed Entertainment Intermedia Films Channel Four Films Greenpoint Films Caméra One West Eleven Films Arena Films Canal+ Sofineurope","m_distributed_by":"Gramercy Pictures","m_release_dates":"20 January 1998 (1998-01-20) (Sundance) | 12 June 1998 (1998-06-12) (U.S.) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"111 minutes","m_country":"United Kingdom France","m_language":"English | The Land Girls is a 1998 film directed by David Leland and starring Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel, Steven Mackintosh and Ann Bell.
