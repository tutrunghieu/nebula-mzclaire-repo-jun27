{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The once-successful steel mills of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, have shut down and most of the employees have been laid off. Former steel workers Gary \"Gaz\" Schofield and Dave Horsefall have resorted to stealing scrap metal from the abandoned mills to sell. Gaz is facing trouble from his former wife, Mandy and her boyfriend Barry over child support payments that he's failed to make since losing his job. Gaz's son, Nathan, loves his father but wishes they could do more \"normal stuff\" in their time together. | One day, Gaz spots a crowd of women lined up outside a local club to see a Chippendale's striptease act. He gets the idea to form his own strip tease group using local men in hopes of making enough money to pay off his child support obligations. The first to join the group is Lomper, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Gaz once worked at for ten years. Severely depressed, Lomper attempts to commit suicide, but is rescued by Dave who convinces him to join the group. Next they recruit Gerald Cooper, a former manager at the plant, who has been hiding the fact that he is unemployed from his wife. Gaz and Dave see Gerald and his wife, Linda, at a dance class and recruit him to teach them some actual dance moves. | The four men hold an open audition to recruit more members and settle on Horse, an older man who is nevertheless a good dancer, and Guy, who can't dance but proves to be well-endowed when he exposes himself. When they are approached by local women while they are hanging up posters for the show, Gaz declares that their show will be better than the local Chippendale dancers because they'll go \"the full monty\" and remove all their clothes. During the rehearsals, Dave drops out due to body image issues and gets a job as a security guard at Asda. The others try a public rehearsal at the abandoned factory in front of several female relatives of Horse, but they are caught mid-show by a passing policeman and arrested. Due to the arrest, Gaz loses the right to see Nathan. But the arrest makes the front page of the newspaper, making them famous. Lomper and Guy are the only ones who escape the police and run to Lomper's house, where they make out. Gerald, meanwhile is thrown out by Linda after bailiffs arrive at their house and seize their belongings to pay Gerald's debts, resulting in him having to stay with Gaz (though coincidentally he ends up getting a job that Gaz and Dave earlier tried to sabotage his interview for). Later Gaz arrives at Asda and asks Dave if he could borrow a jacket for Lomper's mother's funeral to which he agrees and also decides to quit his job and they go to the funeral. | They decide to forgo the plan, until Gaz learns that the show is sold out, and convinces the others to do it for one night only. Dave, having re-gained his confidence with encouragement from his wife, Jean, joins the rest of the group minutes before they go on stage. However, Gaz himself refuses to do it because there are men in the audience (including members of the police department who arrested them earlier), even when Nathan, who has secretly come, tells him that Mandy is there. Nathan later forces his hand and Gaz, proud of his son, performs in front of the audience and Mandy, who seems to see him in a new light. | The film ends with the group on stage in front of a packed house, stripping to Tom Jones' version of \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" (their hats being the final item removed) with an astounding success.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Channel 4 Films paid for the screenplay to be written but then declined to invest any equity in the film. | The famous \"Hot Stuff\" scene, in which the characters dance in the queue at the job centre, was originally going to be cut from the final production as it was \"too unrealistic\".[citation needed] | The cast allegedly agreed that all six of them would really do the \"full monty\" strip at the end in front of 400 extras, provided they had to do only one take. Therefore, the choreographer, Suzanne Darley-Grand, was hiding in front of the stage, just beyond the camera view, screaming directions at the cast during the closing scene.[citation needed] | The opening sequence of the Sheffield promotion film from 1972 is taken from City on the Move, a film commissioned by Peter Wigley, Sheffield's first ever publicity officer, to convince people that Sheffield was a centre for tourism and commerce. City on the Move was produced and directed by Jim and Marie-Luise Coulthard and showed a modern thriving city that was rapidly developing thanks to the successful steel industry in Sheffield. However, the film went virtually unnoticed until the Coulthards were approached about some of the footage being included in The Full Monty for a payment of £400, which they accepted. In 2008, City on the Move was released on DVD under the new name The Reel Monty.[3][4] | The film features frequent use of British slang, and in particular the slang of Sheffield. | The film's title is a phrase generally used in the UK to mean \"the whole lot\", or \"the whole hog\"; in the film, the characters use it to refer to full nudity — as Horse says, \"No one said anything to me about the full monty!\" The phrase, whose origin is obscure, gained a renewed prominence in British culture following the film. | Other dialect words are used in the film; some such as nesh (meaning a person unusually susceptible to cold) are widespread across the North Midlands region. Jennel (an alley) is local to Sheffield:[5] it is a variation on the word \"ginnel\", which is in full versions of the Oxford English Dictionary and is used in many parts of England.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Peter Cattaneo","m_produced_by":"Uberto Pasolini","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Robert Carlyle Mark Addy William Snape Steve Huison Tom Wilkinson Paul Barber Hugo Speer","m_music_by":"Anne Dudley","m_cinematography":"John de Borman","m_edited_by":"David Freeman Nick Moore","m_production_company":"Redwave Films Channel Four Films","m_distributed_by":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","m_release_dates":"29 August 1997 (1997-08-29) (United Kingdom) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"91 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$3.5 million[2]","m_box_office":"$258 million[2] | The Full Monty is a 1997 British comedy-drama film directed by Peter Cattaneo, starring Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, William Snape, Steve Huison, Tom Wilkinson, Paul Barber, and Hugo Speer. The screenplay was written by Simon Beaufoy. The film is set in Sheffield, England and, starting off with a travelogue of the city in 1972, tells the story of six unemployed men, four of them former steel workers, who decide to form a male striptease act (à la Chippendale dancers) in order to gather enough money to get somewhere else and for main character, Gaz, to be able to see his son. Gaz declares that their show will be better than the Chippendales dancers because they will go \"the full monty\" — strip all the way — hence the film's title. Despite being a comedy, the film also touches on serious subjects such as unemployment, fathers' rights, depression, impotence, homosexuality, obesity, working class culture and suicide. | The Full Monty was a major critical success upon release and an unexpected international commercial success, grossing over $250 million from a budget of only $3.5 million. It was the highest grossing film in the UK until it was outsold by Titanic. It was ultimately nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Music Score, winning the latter. | The film was later adapted into a musical in 2000 and a play in 2013. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"THE FULL MONTY (15)\".
