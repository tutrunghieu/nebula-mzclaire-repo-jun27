{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 2003, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign over his body for medical research following his execution. One year later, the automated Skynet system is activated, becomes self-aware, begins to perceive humans as a threat, and eradicates much of humanity with nuclear weapons in the event known as \"Judgment Day\". | In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue (The T-800). He is the only survivor of the assault after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Following Connor's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles, after taking the clothing from a Resistance soldier, who died in the explosion. | John returns to Resistance headquarters, located aboard a nuclear submarine, and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his findings. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio signal believed to have been an order to shut down Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days; in response to an intercepted \"kill list\" created by Skynet with a plan to terminate the Resistance's command staff. John Connor learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father. John returns to his base and meets with his pregnant wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and his second-in-command Barnes (Common). | Arriving at the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus sees a T-600 Terminator and yells at it grasping its attention, but before Marcus is killed he is saved by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a mute child named \"Star\" (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle then signs to Star and she sets off a trap for the T-600 that kills it off. After such, Kyle confronts Marcus with a gun and snaps at him about the blood red ribbon on his left arm (symboling Resistance). Marcus snags Kyle's weapon and points it at him instead asking of the year. Kyle tells Marcus about the war between humanity and Skynet and the year. After, Kyle takes Marcus to their base were Marcus finds a broken radio, he fixes it effortlessly and a broadcast appears on it, after hearing John's radio broadcast the three fall asleep. The three leave in search of others in the Resistance. They survive an attack at a gas station; yet Kyle, Star, and several other people are taken prisoner. | Later, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to Connor's base, where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is, indeed, a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John thinks that Marcus has been sent to execute him and, orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets Marcus live. | John pleads with the General to delay the offensive defense, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown's orders and, instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Marcus learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen) that he was created and built to lure John to this base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times before. The radio signal that the Resistance received is revealed to have been a ruse, and Skynet uses it, to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard. | Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator. Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John revives him, but John is mortally wounded during the fight. Marcus jumps the T-800 when it is distracted and defeats it, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together several Terminator fuel cells to explode and detonates them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John's life, but his heart is too badly damaged. Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John. Recovering, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.","m_cast":"Christian Bale as John Connor. Director McG deemed Bale \"the most credible action star in the world\" during development.[3] McG wanted Bale for Marcus, but the actor—even though he \"can't really remember why\"—wanted to play John, and that led to the character's role getting expanded in rewrites of the script.[4][5] Bale was the first person to be cast and signed on for the role in November 2007. McG talked extensively with Bale in the UK about the role while the latter was filming The Dark Knight, and they both agreed to proceed.[6] Although a fan of the Terminator series, he was at first uninterested until McG convinced him the story would be character-based and not rely on special effects.[3] They kept working on the story every day, along with Worthington.[7] McG said Bale broke his hand punching a Terminator prop during filming.[8] Bale also spent six to eight hours each day with McG in the editing room to advise the finished product.[9] | Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a Skynet human-terminator hybrid experiment. Worthington compared Marcus to Dorothy Gale and Alice due to being \"this person waking up in another world [who then] tries to find himself\".[10] Terminator creator James Cameron personally recommended Worthington (whom he directed in Avatar) to McG.[4][11] Russell Crowe also recommended him to McG. The director decided Worthington looked tougher than the \"great many of today's [waify] young male actors\".[12] Worthington recalled Cameron told him \"the Terminator to make is the one with the war\".[13] Worthington tore his intercostal muscles during the first weeks of filming, but nevertheless insisted on performing his own stunts.[12][14] McG once expressed interest in casting Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis or Josh Brolin in the part.[15][16] Brolin did talk to Bale and read a draft of the screenplay, which he found \"interesting and dark; ultimately, though, I didn't think it felt right\".[17] | Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, a teenage refugee and admirer of John Connor and the Resistance. As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, he was sent back in time to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure the survival of the human race, and fathered John with her. Yelchin said he wanted to portray Kyle as Biehn did and not make him appear weaker because it was a younger version of the character. The difference in his portrayal lies in showing Kyle as intense, but not concentrated until he joins the resistance proper. Yelchin tried to convey Kyle's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.[18] | Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams, a \"no-nonsense and battle-hardened\" pilot of the Resistance who suffers from survivor's guilt and serves as a romantic interest for Marcus.[19][20] McG characterizes her as continuing the feminine strength that has been prominent throughout the franchise.[21] | Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was originally set to play the part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film.[22] As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, as part of the character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which \"reflects things that are going on currently in this privileged world that we are living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world. I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to take that into consideration\".[23] Howard also focused on Kate \"being accustomed to fear and loss\" because the character was a military brat.[24] | Common as Barnes, John's right-hand man.[25] Common stated the character was not overly developed, being \"only just a bad-ass character, you know, really the big heavy of the movie\", before McG's intervention. Common agreed with this, as \"I didn’t want to just be the big, bulky guy there\" and worked on the emotional side, \"thinking about how it would be in a world that’s post-apocalyptic, a world where, you know, things have been destroyed and we’re really fighting for survival.\"[26] | Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan/Skynet: an ex-Cyberdyne scientist who convinces Marcus to donate his body for her research.[27] Her face is later used by the Skynet computer to communicate with Marcus. Tilda Swinton was originally considered for the part, but Bonham Carter replaced her before filming. She accepted the part because her domestic partner, Tim Burton, is a Terminator fan. Her role was a \"small but pivotal\" one and would only require ten days of shooting.[28] On July 20, 2008, Bonham Carter delayed filming by a day,[29] and was given an indefinite leave due to the death of four of her family members in a minibus accident in South Africa.[30] | Michael Ironside as General Ashdown, the leader of the Resistance. | Roland Kickinger as The Terminator / T-800 (Model 101): the first Terminator covered in living tissue. Bodybuilder and actor Kickinger, who previously portrayed Schwarzenegger in the 2005 biographical film See Arnold Run, was his physical double on set. When asked about his role, Kickinger said it is \"Arnold's character in the first Terminator. That's basically my role, but 20 years before, so it establishes how the Terminator came about.\"[31] Polish strongman athlete Mariusz Pudzianowski was also considered for doubling Schwarzenegger.[32] If Schwarzenegger had decided not to lend his appearance to the film, then John would have shot the T-800s face off before the audience got a good look at him.[33] | Jadagrace Berry as Star, an 8-year-old girl in Kyle's care.[24] Born after Judgment Day, Star is mute due to the trauma of the post-apocalyptic world. However, this has given her the unnatural ability to sense when a Terminator is approaching.[21] | Terry Crews as Captain Jericho, Barnes' brother. | Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, John's mother. Sarah's voice is heard from tapes she recorded before her death prior to the film's events.[35]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"In 1999, two years after C2 Pictures purchased the rights to the franchise, two Terminator films' premises were mapped out and were supposed to be developed simultaneously. Tedi Sarafian was hired to write Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which he eventually received shared story credit for, while David C. Wilson was to write Terminator 4. Before any revisions were done, T3 initially took place in 2001 and revolved around the first attacks between Skynet and humans. T4 would follow immediately afterward and centered primarily on the war seen in the first two films.[36] Warner Bros. gave the film the codename \"Project Angel\". | Following the release of Terminator 3 in 2003, producers Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar contracted Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to return as John Connor and Kate Brewster in another film.[37] Director Jonathan Mostow helped develop the script, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and was set to begin production in 2005 after completing another film. It was known by then Arnold Schwarzenegger's role would be limited, as he had assumed office as Governor of California. The producers sought to have Warner Bros. finance the picture as they did for Terminator 3.[38] In 2005, Stahl said John and Kate would be recast as the story jumped forward in time.[39] By 2006, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (as successor to Orion Pictures and Hemdale Film Corporation, distributor and producer of the original film, respectively) was set to distribute the fourth film as part of the new CEO Harry Sloan's scheme to make the studio a viable Hollywood player.[40] | On May 9, 2007, it was announced that production rights to the Terminator series had passed from the feuding Vajna and Kassar to the Halcyon Company. The producers hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise.[41] The purchase was financed with a loan by Pacificor, a hedge fund from Santa Monica.[42] By July 19, the project was in legal limbo due to a lawsuit between MGM and Halcyon subsidiary T Asset. MGM had an exclusive window of 30 days to negotiate for distribution of the Terminator films. When negotiating for Terminator 4, Halcyon rejected their initial proposal, and MGM suspended negotiations. After the 30 days were over, MGM claimed that the period during which negotiations were suspended did not count and their exclusive period was still open. Halcyon asked a court for an injunction allowing them to approach other distributors.[43][44] Later, the lawsuit was settled and MGM got a 30-day right of first refusal to finance and distribute the fifth Terminator film.[45] | Finally, Warner Bros. paid $60 million to acquire the United States distribution rights of Terminator Salvation; Sony Pictures also paid just over $100 million to acquire this film's distribution rights in all international territories.[1] | McG signed on to direct as the first two films were among his favorites, and he had even cast Robert Patrick (who played the T-1000) in his films.[46] Though he was initially unsure about \"flogging a dead horse,\"[3] he felt the post-apocalyptic setting allowed the film to be different enough so as not to be just an inferior sequel. The idea that events in Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines altered the future also allowed them to be flexible with their presentation of the futuristic world.[47] McG met with the series' co-creator James Cameron, and, although he neither blessed nor denigrated the project, Cameron told the new director he had faced a similar challenge when following Ridley Scott's Alien with Aliens.[3] He maintained two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film it is Kyle Reese.[48] | The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who received full screenplay credit. Paul Haggis rewrote Brancato and Ferris's script,[49] and Shawn Ryan made another revision three weeks before filming.[50] Jonathan Nolan also wrote on set, which led to McG to say, \"I would have to characterize Jonah as the lead writer of the film. I don’t know how the WGA rules work\".[47] Nolan contributed to the film after Bale signed on and created Connor's arc of becoming a leader.[51] Anthony E. Zuiker contributed to the script as well.[52] So extensive were the rewrites that Alan Dean Foster decided to rewrite the entire novelization after submitting it to his publisher, because the compiled shooting script was very different from the one he was given beforehand.[53] | In the early script drafts, John was a secondary character. Producer James Middleton explained \"Ben-Hur was influenced by Jesus Christ, but it was his story. Much in that way, this [new main] character will be influenced by John Connor.\" [55] The original ending was to have John killed, and his image kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body. Marcus would have then murdered Kate, Barnes, Kyle, and Star.[56][57][58] However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film.[59] McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, in which he has some followers who believe what he knows about Skynet, and others who do not.[60] | McG described the film's theme as \"where you draw the line between machines and humans\".[3] The friendship between Marcus—who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world—and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can bring out the best in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz.[54] The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.[61] The film's original title was Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, but this was dropped during filming.[54] | Throughout writing, the cast and crew would watch scenes from the three films to pick moments to reference or tribute, including \"Come with me if you want to live\" and \"I'll be back\", which is uttered by John in this film. McG found himself having to decide which ideas for references would be included and which would not.[62] An opening scene has John fighting a Terminator on a crashed helicopter, which was storyboarded as a homage to the climax of the original film, where his mother Sarah, having broken her leg, is chased by a crippled Terminator. McG did this to reflect the skills John learned from her.[12] | Terminator Salvation had a $200 million budget.[1] Shooting of the film started on May 5, 2008 in New Mexico.[63] Filming also took place at Kirtland Air Force Base in the state,[64] after the United States Air Force agreed to provide the crew guidance and aircraft.[65] The filmmakers had originally intended to begin filming on March 15 in Budapest or Australia,[66] but a 25 percent tax rebate and absence of an interest rate cap and floor made the filmmakers seek the cheaper New Mexico, because of their elevated budget.[67] To avoid delays caused by a possible 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike in July, all exterior scenes were completed by then, so production could restart easily.[68][69] The shoot ended on July 20, 2008,[29] though some pick-ups took place in January 2009.[70] | In addition to Bale breaking his hand and Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was testament to the gritty style of the film. \"I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.'\"[61] | The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is a partial silver retention on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, which will be used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for.[7] Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage.[71] The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter.[46] McG cited Mad Max 2, the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences.[3][46] He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?[29][47] Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot.[72] It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.[73] | McG sought to create as many \"in-camera\" elements as possible to make the film more realistic.[74] Many of the settings were hand-built, including an entire gas station for the Harvester attack scenes. The Terminator factory was built on an abandoned factory,[65] and the design crew consulted robot manufacturer companies for a more realistic depiction.[74] A 20-foot-tall (6.1 m) model built and detonated by Kerner Optical was used for the explosion of Skynet's 30-story San Francisco-based lab.[54] | The majority of the machines were designed by Martin Laing, a crew member on Cameron's Titanic and Ghosts of the Abyss.[75] McG described many of the machines as having an H. R. Giger influence.[46] McG's intent was to create a gritty, tactile 2018 on screen, and Laing concurred the robots would have to be black and degraded as none of them are new. Laing devised Aerostats, which are smaller versions of the Aerial Hunter Killers from the previous films. The Aerostats send a signal to the 60-foot-tall (18 m) humanoid Harvesters. They are very big and slow, so they use Mototerminators to capture humans, and the Harvesters place them in Transporters. Laing was unsure of how to design the Transporters until he saw a cattle transport while driving through Albuquerque. | The film also features the first aquatic Skynet robot, the Hydrobot, which Laing modeled on eels,[54] and was built by the animatronics crew with its exterior made of metal-looking rubber so it could be used in the aquatic scenes.[65] | The film features rubber-skinned T-600 and T-700 robots. McG interpreted Kyle Reese's description in the original film of the T-600 as being easy to spot by making them tall and bulky.[3] For scenes of humans fighting with Terminators, the actors interacted with stuntmen wearing motion capture suits, later replaced by digital robots.[74] For the Moto-Terminators, Ducati designers were hired to create the robots, and the on-screen robot was a combination of stuntmen driving actual Ducatis and a Moto-Terminator mock-up, as well as a digital Moto-Terminator.[76] Visual effects studio Imaginary Forces created the Terminator point-of-view sequences, and tried to depict a simple interface, \"free of the frills—anything that a machine would not purely need\", and with more software bugs and anomalies since the robots of Salvation were not as advanced as the Terminators from the previous films.[77] | The majority of the special effects were done by Industrial Light & Magic. Salvation was one of the last films that Stan Winston, the visual effects supervisor on the first three films, worked on. He died on June 15, 2008 from multiple myeloma,[78] and McG dedicated the film to him in the end credits.[9] John Rosengrant and Charlie Gibson replaced Winston,[75] and McG commented that they are \"trying to achieve something that's never been done before\"[79] and \"push the envelope\".[80] Asylum Visual Effects created digital plates, Marcus' endoskeleton and a digital T-600; and Rising Sun Pictures did the digital correction of day for night scenes, the destruction of the submarine and Marcus' robot hand.[81] | Danny Elfman began composing the score in January 2009. Beforehand, McG wanted to hire Gustavo Santaolalla to work on the music for the human characters, while having either Thom Yorke or Jonny Greenwood for Skynet's themes.[35][51] He also wanted to discuss scoring the film with Hans Zimmer but he was unable to arrange a meeting. McG met with The Terminator and Terminator 2 composer Brad Fiedel, but was not interested in repeating the sounds Fiedel achieved in his films. However, McG wanted Elfman to give those themes and ambient sounds a \"Wagnerian quality\".[48] | Reprise Records released the soundtrack on May 19, 2009, which included 15 tracks. While Common had expressed interest in writing a song for the soundtrack,[82] Alice in Chains' \"Rooster\" is the only featured song.[83] Although not included in the soundtrack, \"You Could Be Mine\" by Guns N' Roses, which was featured in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, can be heard briefly in a scene of the film as well.[84] Nine Inch Nails' \"The Day The World Went Away\" is played on the film's theatrical trailer, but is not included in the film or soundtrack. | All music composed by Danny Elfman except Rooster. | During filming, Bale became angry with director of photography Shane Hurlbut for walking onto a set during a scene; he swore and screamed at Hurlbut and threatened to leave the film. Audio of Bale's tirade leaked to the public and went viral.[85] Bale apologized publicly and said he resolved his differences with Hurlbut, explaining that he sometimes has a problem with someone walking on set, and that when the incident took place they continued to work together for a number of hours that day.[86] | In March 2009, producer Moritz Borman filed a lawsuit against the Halcyon Company, seeking $160 million. Borman, who had arranged the transfer of the Terminator rights to Halcyon in May 2007, claimed the company's two managers, Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek, had \"hijacked\" the production and refused to give him his $2.5 million share of the production. Borman alleged budget overruns were the reasons Anderson and Kubicek did not pay him and that they had $1 million in debt.[87] Nevertheless, an \"amicable\" resolution was reached a month later.[88] | Further complications occurred on May 20, 2009, when executive producer Peter D. Graves, who informed Anderson and Kubicek about the Terminator rights, filed a breach-of-contract claim for arbitration, alleging that they owe him $750,000.[1]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"Characters  by James Cameron Gale Anne Hurd","m_directed_by":"McG","m_produced_by":"Derek Anderson | Moritz Borman | Victor Kubicek | Jeffrey Silver","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Christian Bale | Sam Worthington | Anton Yelchin | Moon Bloodgood | Bryce Dallas Howard | Common | Michael Ironside | Helena Bonham Carter","m_music_by":"Danny Elfman Brad Fiedel (themes)","m_cinematography":"Shane Hurlbut","m_edited_by":"Conrad Buff","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Warner Bros.

It is the fourth installment of the Terminator film series. In a departure from the previous installments, which were set between 1984 and 2004 and used time travel as a key plot element, Salvation is a post-apocalyptic film set in the year 2018 and focuses on the war between Skynet machines and humanity, with the human Resistance fighting against Skynet's killing machines. Bale portrays John Connor, Resistance fighter and central character to the franchise, while Worthington portrays cyborg Marcus Wright. Terminator Salvation also featured Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese, a character first introduced in The Terminator, and the film depicts the origin of the T-800 (Model 101) Terminator. | After a troubled pre-production, with The Halcyon Company acquiring the rights for the franchise from Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar and several writers working on the screenplay, filming began in May 2008 in New Mexico and ran for 77 days. Terminator Salvation was released on May 21, 2009 in the United States and Canada, followed by early June releases in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Warner Bros. handled the North American release while Columbia Pictures handled the international release.
