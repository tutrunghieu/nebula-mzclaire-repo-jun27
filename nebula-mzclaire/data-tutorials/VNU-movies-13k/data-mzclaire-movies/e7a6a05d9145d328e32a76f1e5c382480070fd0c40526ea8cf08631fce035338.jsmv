Its fragmented structure has been compared to a William Faulkner's novel, particularly to The Sound and the Fury (1929).[6] The narrative — consisting of a prologue, five sections, and an epilogue — leaps around in time and switches between the viewpoints of Justin, Alex, Marie, and Juliette. The Sound and the Fury unfolds over four days, likewise, switching narrative perspectives. Both The Sound and the Fury and Thieves also have a central female character who is loved obsessively by two of the narrators: Faulkner’s novel has Caddie, who is loved by her brothers Benjy and Quentin, and Téchiné’s film has Juliette, who is the love interest of both Alex and Marie.[7] The divided time structure emphasize the interlapping relationships between the characters.[8] | The original score for the film was written by Alain Sarde, regular composer in Téchiné's films.[2] The sound track includes an eclectic mix of artist and styles like : Cheb Mami, Liza Minnelli, The Archies and Mozart.[9] | Douha Alia Cheb Mami | Baadini Rachid Taha | Sous le soleil de Bodega Les Négresses Vertes | Sugar Sugar The Archies | The Magic Flute Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart | Tonite Les Rita Mitsouko | La Valse Petite La Tordue[10]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"André Téchiné","m_produced_by":"Alain Sarde","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Daniel Auteuil Catherine Deneuve Laurence Côte","m_music_by":"Philippe Sarde","m_cinematography":"Jeanne Lapoirie","m_edited_by":"Martine Giordano","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":null,"m_release_dates":"May 1996 (1996-05) (Cannes) | 21 August 1996 (1996-08-21) (France) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"117 minutes","m_country":"France","m_language":"French","m_budget":"8.400.000 € [1]","m_box_office":"$17,145,357 [1] | Thieves (French: Les Voleurs) is a 1996 French drama film directed by André Téchiné, starring Daniel Auteuil, Catherine Deneuve and Laurence Côte.[2] The plot follows a cynical police officer, who comes from a family of thieves, and a lonely philosophy professor, both romantically involved with a self-destructive petty criminal.
