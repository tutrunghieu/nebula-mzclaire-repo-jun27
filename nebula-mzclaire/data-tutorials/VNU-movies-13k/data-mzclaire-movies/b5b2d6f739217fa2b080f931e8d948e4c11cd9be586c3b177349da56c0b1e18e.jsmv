{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film takes place in the fictional town of Spurbury, Vermont, near the Canadian border. The plot centers on five Vermont state troopers who seem to have more of a knack for pranks than actual police work. Most of their time is spent devising new ways of messing with the heads of the people they pull over and hazing \"Rabbit,\" a new recruit. They also find time to torment their easily infuriated radio dispatcher, Rodney Farva, who has been exiled from patrol work because he was involved in a fight with several students during a questionable traffic stop of a school bus, which is later revealed during the credits. Their days of pranking and slacking off are cut short when the troopers suddenly find themselves attempting to solve a murder, bust a drug-smuggling ring, and avoid having their post eliminated by the state's impending budget cut — resulting in their transfer, or quitting and opening up a roller disco. | The troopers have an ongoing rivalry with the Spurbury Police Department, Spurbury's local police. They repeatedly enter conflicts with them (\"highway cops versus the local cops\"); one such dispute breaks out into an all-out fistfight, further increasing the station's chances of being shut down. The rivalry eventually results in the governor's (Lynda Carter) praise for the efforts of the Spurbury PD, who had managed to keep one step ahead of the state police by making their department appear responsible for the confiscation of the smuggled drugs. Defeated, the defrocked troopers unexpectedly stumble upon the scheme in which the local police are running protection for the aforementioned drug smugglers. The film's epilogue finds the highway post still eliminated due to the budget cuts; however, the troopers become the new officers of the Spurbury PD replacing their incarcerated corrupt predecessors and thus free to continue their shenanigans in and around their jurisdiction.","m_cast":"Jay Chandrasekhar as Trooper Arcot \"Thorny\" Ramathorn, a veteran of the Vermont State Police who is the second-in-command of his barracks. | Paul Soter as Trooper Jeff Foster, arguably the most calm and reserved Trooper of the force. | Steve Lemme as Trooper MacIntyre \"Mac\" Womack, the Trooper who enjoys pranks the most. | Erik Stolhanske as Trooper Robert \"Rabbit\" Roto, a rookie State Trooper. | Kevin Heffernan as Trooper Rodney \"Rod\" Farva, a fat, loud, obnoxious and arrogant radio operator. | Brian Cox as Captain John O'Hagen, the commander of his Vermont State Trooper barracks. | Daniel von Bargen as Police Chief Bruce Grady | Marisa Coughlan as Officer Ursula Hanson | James Grace as Officer Jim Rando | Michael Weaver as Officer Samuel Smy | Dan Fey as Officer Jack Burton | Andre Vippolis as College boy 1 | Joey Kern as College boy 2 | Geoffrey Arend as College boy 3 | Amy de Lucia as Bobbi | Philippe Brenninkmeyer as German man | Maria Tornberg as German woman | Jimmy Noonan as Frank Galikanokus | Jim Gaffigan as Larry Johnson | Blanchard Ryan as Casino La Fantastique Sally | Charlie Finn as Dimpus Burger guy | Lynda Carter as Vermont Governor Jessman | John Bedford Lloyd as Mayor Timber","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Broken Lizard member Steve Lemme stated that the idea for the film came from road tripping to various weddings in his friend and fellow BL member Jay Chandraskhar's car and frequently getting pulled over by cops.[2] As they were frequently under the influence of drugs, the gang began to wonder what would happen if the cops were A) aware of the situation and B) \"had a sense of humor\".
