{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Martin Bonner has just moved to Nevada from Maryland, leaving behind his two adult children and a life he spent more than two decades building. He is there working at a new job as the volunteer coordinator for a non-profit organization that helps prisoners make the transition from incarceration to freedom. It is Martin’s first job in two years and he has recently declared bankruptcy. | At the same time, Travis Holloway, a prisoner in the program, is being released after serving twelve years. Sent back into the world with nothing, Travis also finds life in Reno difficult to adjust to, despite the help from his program sponsor, Steve Helms. | The stories of Martin and Travis slowly converge, as the two men meet and find that they have much in common, not the least of which is an unspoken need for encouragement and support. Their unlikely friendship blossoms but is put to the test when Travis betrays Martin's trust in order to reunite with his estranged daughter.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 93% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.8/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Solemn but heartfelt, This Is Martin Bonner is a slow-burning drama with an outstanding performance by Paul Eenhoorn as the title character.\"[11] Metacritic rated it 71/100 based on ten reviews.[12] John Anderson of Variety described it as \"A mood piece, a character study and an exercise in poetic gesture possessed of a sort of evanescent, secular spirituality. Helmer Chad Hartigan's second feature is Americana of a very immediate sort, a tale of redemption that may leave its viewers with an uncanny sense of peace.\"[13] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Acted with smart restraint and shot with corresponding composure, this is a somber drama built out of small but acutely observed moments of naturalistic behavior.\"[14] The New York Times reviewer Nicolas Rapold commented, \"It's gratifying to see the care taken with his characters, though it would be no betrayal of them for Mr. Hartigan to flesh out their world and their lives further.\"[15] | It won the 2013 Sundance Best of Next audience award[16] and the 2014 Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award.[17]","m_production":"This Is Martin Bonner was shot on location in Reno and Sparks, Nevada, using the Red One camera.
