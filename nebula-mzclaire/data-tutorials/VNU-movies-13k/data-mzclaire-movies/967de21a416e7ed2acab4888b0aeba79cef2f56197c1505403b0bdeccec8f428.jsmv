On the plane, her husband suffers a fatal heart attack. Karen decides to stay in Italy and rent a luxury apartment in Rome. The Contessa Magda Terribili-Gonzales (Lotte Lenya) soon introduces her to a young Italian man, Paolo (Warren Beatty), who is actually a highly paid professional gigolo. Karen and Paolo begin an affair, but it soon becomes obvious that Paolo is in it only for personal gain. He is soon bored by Mrs. Stone, and leaves her to pursue a young American film actress (Jill St. John). Ridiculed by the Contessa, chastised by her friend Meg (Coral Browne) and abandoned by Paolo, Mrs. Stone is soon utterly debased enough to surrender herself to a ragged, mysterious young man who has been following her obsessively. In the end, it seems as if Mrs. Stone has literally given up her life.","m_cast":"Vivien Leigh as Karen Stone | Warren Beatty as Paolo di Leo | Lotte Lenya as Contessa | Coral Browne as Meg | Jill St. John as Barbara | Jeremy Spenser as Young man | Stella Bonheur as Mrs. Jamison-Walker | Peter Dyneley as Lloyd Greener | Carl Jaffe as Baron Waldheim | Harold Kasket as Tailor | Viola Keats as Julia McIlheny | Cleo Laine as Singer | Bessie Love as Bunny | Elspeth March as Mrs. Barrow | Henry McCarty as Campbell Kennedy | Warren Mitchell as Giorgio | John Phillips as Tom Stone | Paul Stassino as Stefano – The Barber | Ernest Thesiger as Stefano | Mavis Villiers as Mrs. Coogan","m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"José Quintero","m_produced_by":"Louis De Rochemont Lothar Wolff","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Vivien Leigh Warren Beatty Lotte Lenya Jill St. John Coral Browne","m_music_by":"Richard Addinsell","m_cinematography":"Harry Waxman","m_edited_by":"Ralph Kemplen","m_production_company":"Warner Bros. – Seven Arts","m_distributed_by":"Warner-Pathé Distributors (UK) Warner Bros.
