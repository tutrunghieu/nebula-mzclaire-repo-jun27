{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Stella (Bette Midler) is a feisty woman working in a bar when she meets and falls for the suave charms of the young Dr. Steve Dallas (Stephen Collins). Although from opposite ends of the social spectrum, they start an affair resulting in Stella becoming pregnant. After he proposes half-heartedly, she rejects him and embarks upon raising their child Jenny as a single mother but is always helped and encouraged by her stalwart friend, a local good natured barfly, Ed Munn (John Goodman). Stella is fiercely independent and proud and is determined to do well by this child and take on whatever jobs she must to raise her daughter properly. When Jenny is 4 years old, her father suddenly reappears on the scene and is determined to get to know his daughter. At first reluctant to allow this, Stella is persuaded to allow contact, and a happy bond develops between the father and daughter. As Jenny (Trini Alvarado) grows up, she becomes torn between her father's rich and well-connected background, and her loyalty and love for her mother who is poor and vulgar but devoted to her daughter. She also despises the perceived relationship she sees developing between Stella and Ed Munn who is now a broken alcoholic. Jenny eventually meets and falls for a boy from her fathers 'world' and Stella realizes that now, the disparities in her own and Jennys father's backgrounds might jeopardize her daughter's future happiness. So she makes a heart rending decision towards the end of the film to ensure that this is not going to happen.","m_cast":"Bette Midler as Stella Claire | John Goodman as Ed Munn | Trini Alvarado as Jenny Claire Ashley Peldon as Jenny (age 3) Alisan Porter as Jenny (age 8) | Stephen Collins as Stephen Dallas | Marsha Mason as Janice Morrison | Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Wilkerson | Ben Stiller as Jim Uptegrove | Linda Hart as Debbie Whitman | William McNamara as Pat Robbins","m_reception":"The movie received mediocre reviews.[1][2][3][4] In her New York Times review, Janet Maslin said, \"Bette Midler, too old for the film's opening and too smart for its resolution, isn't exactly the right actress, but she's a lot closer than might have been expected.
