{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim are two filmmakers who are given a record-setting $1 billion budget to make a movie. The funds are provided by Tommy Schlaaang and the Schlaaang Corporation. The two waste all of their money on the making of Bonjour, Diamond Jim, a three-minute film (based on a poem by \"personal shopper and spiritual guru\" Jim Joe Kelly (Zach Galifianakis) who they paid $500,000 a week), plus expensive makeovers, 10-course lunches, real diamonds for Diamond Jim's suit, and a Johnny Depp impersonator. Because of this, the two leave Los Angeles in fear that they will go to prison or be hunted down by the Schlaaang Corp. | After seeing an advertisement for it in a nightclub bathroom, Tim and Eric decide to renovate the S'Wallow Valley Mall run by Damien Weebs (Will Ferrell), in the hopes that they will make back their billion dollar debt. While trying to refurbish the mall, they must deal with vagrants (such as a man-child named Taquito (John C. Reilly), bizarre stores (such as Reggie's Used Toilet Paper Discount Warehouse), and a man-eating wolf that stalks the food court. | During their time at the S'Wallow Valley Mall, Tim and Eric also face many challenges, such as an angry shop owner named Alan Bishopman (Will Forte) who \"doesn't want anything to change\", and the fact that Eric is in love with Katie (Twink Caplan), a woman who works at the mall (whom Eric also compulsively masturbates to.) Because of this, Tim poisons Eric and ends up making love to Katie, whilst Eric goes to the Shrim Alternative Healing Center, run by Dr. Doone Struts (Ray Wise) to seek \"spiritual healing\", only to be placed in a bathtub which gets filled with diarrhea by Struts' sons as part of the \"spiritual healing\". After the event, Eric finds Tim sleeping with Katie and subsequently fights Tim. After the fight, Eric apologizes to Tim for starting the fight and understands why Tim made love to Katie. | They are eventually discovered by the Schlaaang Corporation thanks to Alan. After a dramatic shootout in front of the mall, in which most of the main characters are killed, Tim and Eric manage to kill the members of the Schlaaang Corporation, and are sentenced to death for murder. | However, it is revealed that the preceding events are actually a film the two were showing to Steven Spielberg, who pronounces it the greatest movie ever made. Tim and Eric then celebrate with their Awesome Show co-stars.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California, and Palm Springs at the abandoned Desert Fashion Plaza which was used for S'wallow Valley Mall.[5] Tim and Eric had originally planned to use an entire town but for budgetary reasons it was scaled back to a mall. The idea for a dying shopping center came from Monroeville Mall (of Dawn of the Dead fame) and Hunt Valley Mall in Eric's hometown of Baltimore. Like the fictional mall, Hunt Valley was in fact redeveloped from top to bottom except the interior walkways have been converted to open-air and was successful upon its \"grand reopening\". The same went for Desert Fashion Plaza which was in the process of being de-malled and re-imagined as a new \"Main Street\" at the time filming began, adding authenticity to the movie setting.[citation needed] | Before the movie's release Tim and Eric started the Billion Dollar Pledge asking fans and celebrities to support them by signing a document stating they would not illegally download the film, and also not to see its box office competition The Lorax. Stars who took part in the pledge ranged from comedians and actors Ben Stiller, Mark Proksch, Bob Odenkirk, Seth Green, Peter Serafinowicz, Todd Barry, Rashida Jones and others, to musicians Weird Al Yankovic, Maynard James Keenan, Josh Groban, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Maroon 5.[6]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Tim Heidecker Eric Wareheim","m_produced_by":"Will Ferrell Adam McKay Dave Kneebone Tim Heidecker Eric Wareheim","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Michael Gross","m_music_by":"Davin Wood","m_cinematography":"Rachel Morrison","m_edited_by":"Daniel Haworth Doug Lussenhop","m_production_company":"2929 Productions Gary Sanchez Productions Funny or Die Abso Lutely Films","m_distributed_by":"Magnet Releasing","m_release_dates":"January 20, 2012 (2012-01-20) (Sundance Film Festival) | March 2, 2012 (2012-03-02) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"94 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$3 million[1]","m_box_office":"$223,580[2] | Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie (shorthand BD$M) is a 2012 American comedy film written and directed by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, creators of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!.
