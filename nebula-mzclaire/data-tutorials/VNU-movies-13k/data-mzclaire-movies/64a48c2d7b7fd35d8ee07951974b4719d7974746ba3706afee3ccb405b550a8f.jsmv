{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film starts in medias res, 13 years after Baiano's death in the first film's plot. Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura) is shown leaving a hospital. Soon after, his car is blocked and gunned down by unknown gunmen. | 4 years prior, Nascimento, now divorced and a Lieutenant Colonel in BOPE, arrives at Bangu Penitentiary Complex to put down a prison riot started by gang boss Beirada (Seu Jorge), who demands that human rights activist Diogo Fraga (Irandhir Santos) come in to negotiate. After Fraga convinces Beirada to release hostages taken during the riot, Nascimento's protégé Captain André Matias (André Ramiro) storms in and executes Beirada against Nascimento's orders. Fraga, who is also husband of Nascimento's ex-wife Rosana (Maria Ribeiro), subsequently expresses his outrage over the situation to the media. | When Nascimento hears that PMERJ commander Formoso (Rodrigo Candelot) will fire him over the controversy, he goes to personally confront him at a restaurant, only to be greeted by cheering diners who approved the execution. Guaracy (Adriano Garib), Rio de Janeiro's State Secretary for Public Safety, exploits the situation by promoting Nascimento to the office of State Subsecretary of Intelligence and expelling Matias from BOPE and demoting him to the state police. | Nascimento tries to convince Matias that he can settle the situation, but Matias rebukes him and goes to tabloid journalist Clara Vidal (Tainá Müller) to give her an interview about disregard of BOPE and the corruption of the governor, leading to his detention. Meanwhile, Fraga leverages his influence to become a state representative in Rio's State Assembly and convinces Nascimento's son Rafael that his father is a bad influence on him. | Nevertheless, Nascimento continues to focus on his work. He has BOPE and its arsenal expanded, increasing the staff number from 100 officers to 390 officers and funding them with armored vehicles and helicopters, enabling him to eliminate drug cartels from multiple favelas. Although he theorizes that this would also bankrupt corrupt cops in the process, a group of corrupt cops led by Major Rocha (Sandro Rocha), realize that they can extort money from the entire favelas instead of just dealers. Rocha's group forms a militia, using BOPE to clean out the dealers. They finance cable TV, water supplies, banks, internet services and deliveries, forming a racket of money extortion from the favelas to amass money, gaining political and public support as they are cleaning the favelas from drug dealers. | 4 years later, a group of disguised militia raid a police station in Tanque, one of the few remaining strongholds of Rio's drug trade after Nascimento's interventions, and steal a number of police rifles. It is part of a plan devised by corrupt policemen and associate politicians to create an excuse to raid the slum and get rid of the local dealers. Nascimento assures Secretary Guaracy that there is no evidence that the dealers have taken the weapons after listening to 300 hours' worth of tapped phone calls. Corrupt Lieutenant-Colonel Fabio Barbosa (Milhem Cortaz), however, states that an informant of his blamed the dealers, and the raid is authorized by the state governor. | Matias, brought back into BOPE by Rocha, knows that the dealers always flee the slum running past a police station, whose corrupt officers will do nothing. He and his BOPE men then replace the corrupt officers to catch the fleeing dealers by surprise. The next day, BOPE team arrives and raids the slum and attacks the dealers, who are shot dead when they pass by the station. Local drug lord Pepa tries to escape, but is ultimately cornered by Matias, who thinks he's got the guns and tortures him into talking. Rocha, along with Fabio and other corrupt officers, arrives and kills Pepa, enraging Matias, who has his BOPE soldiers carry away the dealer's body, and then confronts Rocha about the situation, only to be shot dead in the back by one of Rocha's men, under Fabio's protests. | Promising himself to find out the truth about André Matias' death, Nascimento uses his power to tap Fraga's telephone, with knowledge that he has been investigating the militias as well after hearing it from his son Rafael, who is an intern in Fraga's office. Meanwhile, Clara goes into one of Rocha's favelas with a photographer to collect information about corrupt officers for a newsstory. However, just as Clara tells Fraga by telephone what she just discovered, they are caught by Rocha and his group, and Fraga hears Rocha's voice before Rocha has Clara and the photographer murdered, who will now have to put Fraga down since he is now a witness. | Nascimento listens to the recording of her final phone talk and deduces Fraga is the next target. Since Fraga is with Rosane and Rafael, he records the data, takes it with him and goes after his family. Just after he leaves, Formoso finds out about his tapping of Fraga's phone and warns the corrupt officers about this. Nascimento heads for Fraga's apartment while trying to phone Rosane, but she deliberately ignores the calls. As Fraga, Rafael and Rosane arrive, two men in a motorcycle try to murder Fraga in a drive-by shooting, but end up hitting Rafael in the chest instead. After Nascimento shoots back, but misses. | After Rafael is taken to the hospital, Nascimento sets up a police roadblock near the Secretary's house and brutally beats him up in a fit of rage. The following day, the President of the Legislative Assembly decides to open an investigation over Clara's possible murderer (due to the lack of bodies, the police is treating the case as kidnapping), and Nascimento is forced to step down as Subsecretary for Public Safety for illegally tapping Fraga's phone in an effort to have Nascimento humiliated. The assumption is that the illegal tap had been made with the intention of spying on his ex-wife. | However, the Secretary and his allies decide not to kill Nascimento, as his death during the trial would make him a matyr for human rights and implicate them, causing a national scandal; Rocha, knowing that, if Nascimento testifies, blame will fall on his militia and, by extension, himself, decides to proceed with the assassination despite his superiors' orders not to. | That night, Nascimento arrives at the hospital, where Rafael is slowly recovering after his surgery. He tells Rosane to call him anytime she needs him, and then leaves the hospital, as shown in the opening sequence. As he leaves, a man with a radio informs Rocha about his departure, while another car follows Nascimento. Rocha arrives with his convoy and starts shooting at Nascimento, but the other car's occupants exit and start shooting at Rocha's men, revealing themselves to be BOPE officers shadowing Nascimento, who had predicted the attempt on his life. Despite losing the gunfight, Rocha escapes. | The next day, Nascimento is called to the State Assembly and testifies with Fraga for over three hours at the court, implicating many politicians and policemen. In the aftermath, Gregorio Fortunado (André Mattos), a state representative and local TV presenter who sides with the militia, is sentenced to prison; many corrupt officers and their allies are murdered as their leaders try to silence them, and Fabio himself lures Rocha to his boat and then murders him and his posse. The governor, however, manages to be reelected, and Guaracy is elected state representative for Rio de Janeiro in the Chamber of Deputies, as is Fraga; the two start a rivalry. Nascimento ends his narration with a reflection over the influence of politicians on the social issues of Brazil, while aerial images of Brasília are shown. In the final scene, he visits his son in the hospital just as he first wakes up from his coma.","m_cast":"Wagner Moura as Roberto Nascimento, Lieutenant Colonel of the PMERJ and State Subsecretary for Public Safety. | Irandhir Santos as Diogo Fraga, a History teacher who becomes a State Representative after the Bangu I controversy.

In Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, Nascimento is 40 years old and has a slightly grayer hair. André Ramiro is also back as Captain André Matias (promoted from Officer Cadet); the actor was prepped by professionals from the CATI-SWAT to give orders to the cops on-screen. Musician and actor Seu Jorge (who played Mané Galinha in City of God) was invited by director José Padilha to act as one of the antagonists, Beirada; Maria Ribeiro is also back as Roseane, who is no longer married to Nascimento, but to a left wing Congressman. Tainá Müller, who was not in the first film, plays Clara, representing the media. Sandro Rocha, who had little on-screen time during the first film, has a bigger role now, playing Major Rocha, known as Russo (Russian), boss of the militia. | Between November and December 2009, before recording for the film started, every actor - except Maria Ribeiro, pregnant at the time - had a training routine, led by Fátima Toledo. Part of the cast also went through a boot camp in Rio, coordinated by Paulo Storani, security adviser, and with the participation of members from BOPE and CATI. André Ramiro said, \"They treated us like real cops. No 'I'm-too-important'. I also had to say 'No, sir. Yes, sir'\". Wagner Moura had Jiu-Jitsu lessons from fighter Rickson Gracie. The training helped bring a degree of reality to the film; actors had to learn the proper techniques to handle weapons and also action strategies in risk-zones, besides a strong fitness program, laid heavy on those who weren't in the first movie. | Filming started on January 25 of 2010, with the participation of eighty real cops as extras. On February 1, recording took place at Morro Dona Marta, in the Botafogo borough, with the use of two helicopters and heavy guns, leading to next-door neighbors thinking it was a real shoot-out. For the scenes happening at the Bangu 1 prison, forty professionals worked during two months constructing a 500m² detention center, based on notations from art director Tiago Marques about the place, since they didn't get clearance to take pictures of the real building. The scenes at the prison were recorded during the four days of the 2010 carnival. One of the film scenes would be shot at the House of Congress in Brasília, but production couldn't get permission. A fake Ethics Committee was built inside the Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro, recording took place at April 15. Filming was done in the same month and the film went to post-production.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"José Padilha","m_produced_by":"Marcos Prado","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Wagner Moura Irandhir Santos André Ramiro Milhem Cortaz André Mattos Maria Ribeiro","m_music_by":"Pedro Bromfman","m_cinematography":"Lula Carvalho","m_edited_by":"Daniel Rezende","m_production_company":"Zazen Produções","m_distributed_by":"Zazen Produções (Brazil) Variance Films (United States)","m_release_dates":"October 8, 2010 (2010-10-08) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"116 minutes","m_country":"Brazil","m_language":"Portuguese","m_budget":"R$ 16 million[1] (US$ 9,509,65)","m_box_office":"$63,027,681[2] | Elite Squad: The Enemy Within (Portuguese: Tropa de Elite 2 – O Inimigo Agora é Outro; lit.
