{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"On August 18, 1973, five young adults - Erin, her boyfriend Kemper, and their friends Morgan, Andy, and Pepper - are on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert after returning from Mexico to buy marijuana. While driving through Texas, they pick up a distraught hitchhiker they see walking in the middle of the road. After trying to talk to the hitchhiker, who speaks incoherently about \"a bad man\", she pulls out a .357 Magnum pistol and shoots herself in the mouth. | The group goes to a nearby eatery to contact the police where a woman named Luda Mae tells them to meet the sheriff at the mill. Instead of the sheriff, they find a young boy named Jedidiah, who tells them that the sheriff is at home. Erin and Kemper go through the woods to find his house, leaving Morgan, Andy, and Pepper at the mill with the boy. They come across a plantation house and Erin is allowed inside by an amputee named Monty to call for help. When Erin finishes, Monty asks her for help. Kemper goes inside to look for Erin and is killed with a sledgehammer by Thomas Hewitt, AKA \"Leatherface\", who drags his body into the basement to make a new mask. | Meanwhile, Sheriff Hoyt arrives at the mill and disposes of the hitchhiker's body, wrapping her in cellophane and putting her in his trunk. When Erin returns she finds that Kemper is still missing. Andy and Erin go back to Monty's house, and Erin distracts him while Andy searches for Kemper. Monty realizes Andy is inside and summons Leatherface, who attacks him with his chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface slices Andy's leg off and carries him to the basement, where he is impaled on a meat hook. | Erin makes it back to the mill, but before she can leave the sheriff shows up. After finding marijuana on the dashboard, he orders Erin, Morgan, and Pepper to get out of the van. The sheriff forces Morgan back into the van, and after giving him the gun he took from the hitchhiker, he tells him to reenact how she killed herself. Morgan, scared and disturbed by the sheriff's demands, attempts to shoot him only to find that the gun is unloaded. Sheriff Hoyt handcuffs Morgan and drives him to the Hewitt house, taking the van's key with him. Erin manages to hot wire the truck but the wheels fall off. Leatherface arrives shortly after and starts hacking through the roof. | When Pepper attempts to run she is killed by Leatherface. After seeing that Leatherface is wearing Kemper's face as a mask, Erin runs and hides in a nearby trailer belonging to an obese middle-aged woman (known only as 'Tea Lady'), and a younger woman named Henrietta, who offer her tea. The women act strangely, and after telling Erin they don't have a phone, a phone rings and Henrietta tells someone on the other end \"she's here\". Erin discovers they have kidnapped a child when she sees that the baby with them is the same child in a photograph with the hitchhiker. However, the tea is drugged, and Erin passes out before she can leave the trailer. Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house surrounded by the Hewitt family: Leatherface, his mother Luda Mae, Sheriff Hoyt, Uncle Monty, and Jedidiah. Luda Mae tells Erin that her excuse for her son Thomas' actions is that he was tormented his whole life because of a skin disease that left his face disfigured, and she felt no one cared for her family besides themselves. Erin is taken to the basement, where she finds Andy. After several failed attempts to help him off the hook, she stabs him to end his suffering. | Afterwards, she finds Morgan handcuffed in a bathtub. Jedidiah, who does not agree with his family's actions, leads them out of the house. Jedidiah rejects Erin's plea to come with them, and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned shack in the woods and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, causing him to drop his chainsaw. Leatherface lifts Morgan, entangling his handcuffs in the chandelier, and saws through his groin, killing him. Erin runs out of the shack and escapes through the woods, pursued by Leatherface. She finds a slaughterhouse and hides in a locker. Leatherface opens the locker across from hers and she attacks him with a meat cleaver, chopping off his right arm. Erin runs outside and flags down a trucker, who she tries to convince to drive away from the Hewitt's house, but he stops to find help at the eatery. Erin sees Luda Mae and Sheriff Hoyt talk to the truck driver, while Henrietta watches over the kidnapped baby. When Henrietta walks outside to join Luda Mae and Sheriff Hoyt, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery and places her in the sheriff's car. Erin hot wires the car and Hoyt tries to stop her, but she runs him over repeatedly until he is dead. Leatherface suddenly appears in the road and slashes the car with his chainsaw, but Erin manages to escape with the baby, and he watches in anger as she drives away.","m_cast":"Jessica Biel as Erin | Jonathan Tucker as Morgan | Erica Leerhsen as Pepper | Mike Vogel as Andy | Eric Balfour as Kemper | Andrew Bryniarski as Thomas Hewitt / Leatherface | R.

The consensus is: \"An unnecessary remake that's more gory and less scary than the original.\"[13] Metacritic, another review aggregator, calculates an average of 38%, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[14] Roger Ebert gave the film a rare 0 stars out of 4, calling it \"A contemptible film: Vile, ugly and brutal. There is not a shred of reason to see it. Those who defend it will have to dance through mental hoops of their own devising, defining its meanness and despair as 'style' or 'vision' or 'a commentary on our world'.\"[15] Variety gave the film a negative review, calling the film \"initially promising, but quickly disappointing retread of a hugely influential horror classic\". [16] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone panned the film, also awarding it 0/4 stars, stating, \"Director Marcus Nispel, acclaimed for his ads and music videos, has a sharp eye and the good sense to hire Daniel Pearl, who shot the first Chainsaw. But all the bad-rehash mojo from Friday the 13th to The Blair Witch Project has infected Scott Kosar's script. Hooper went for primitive, Nispel goes for slick. Hooper went easy on the gore, Nispel pours it on\" and called the film \"soulless\".[17] Dave Kehr from The New York Times gave the film a negative review, stating, \"Rather than exhilaration, this bilious film offers only entrapment and despair\" further commenting that the film was about as much fun as sitting in on an autopsy.[18] Leonard Maltin awarded the film 11/2 out of 4, complimenting the film's intensity but criticized the lack of likable characters and the lack of humor which was present in the original, stating, \"Once it kicks into gear, it's brutally unrelenting toward its unappealing characters and the audience.\"[19] | Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune rated it 3/4 stars and called it \"an effectively scary slasher film\" despite its absurd premise.[20] Total Film rated it 3/5 stars and compared it favorably to Cabin Fever, which they said was not as suspenseful as Chainsaw.[21] William Thomas of Empire rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \"You'll have to overcome resentment towards this unnecessary remake before you can be properly terrorised but, on its own terms, it plays well.\"[22] | The film earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Remake or Sequel, but lost the award to Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.[23] | The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released in North America on October 17, 2003, in 3,018 theaters.[24] It grossed $10,620,000 on its opening day and concluded its North America opening weekend with $28,094,014, ranking No. 1 at the box office.[25] The film opened in various other countries and grossed $26,500,000, while the North American gross stands at $80,571,655, bringing the worldwide gross to $107,071,655.[26] The film's budget was $9.5 million.[27]","m_production":"On December 5, 2001, Creature Corner.com reported that Michael Bay's newly created company Platinum Dunes (which was created in order to produce low budget films), had set its focus on remaking The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Early announcements on the site indicated that the story would be told in flashback with actress Marilyn Burns who starred in the original film would reprise her role as an aged Sally Hardesty recounting the events in the film. It was later announced that the filmmakers had already purchased the rights to the original film. Early in the film's production the original films makers Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel would be writing a script for the film, but it was unknown at the time whether or not that their script would be used. In June 2002, it was announced that Marcus Nispel would direct the film in his directorial debut.[4] Nispel said that he was initially against the idea of remaking the film, calling it \"blasphemy\" to his longtime director of photography, Daniel Pearl, who had shot the original film. Pearl, however, encouraged Nispel to join the project, as he wanted to bookend his career with Chainsaw films.[5] | Scott Kosar later signed on as the film's screenwriter.[6] In Kosar's earlier drafts, the original age of the hitchhiker was 15–16 years old but was later changed in order to fit the age of the principal cast.[citation needed] | Jessica Biel, who previously starred in the television series 7th Heaven, was revealed to cast as the main character Erin.[4] | Actor Andrew Bryniarski, who starred in Bay's Pearl Harbor and stayed friends with him afterwards, personally met with producer Bay and asked him for the role of Leatherface. Another actor was cast for the role before Bryniarski, but, on the first day, the actor was hospitalized and fired for lying about his physical abilities. Without an actor for the film's main antagonist, the filmmakers called and asked if Bryniarski still wanted the role, which he accepted. To prepare for the role, Bryniarski ate a diet of brisket and white bread in order to get his weight to nearly 300 pounds. Bryniarski would later reprise his role as Leatherface in the film's prequel.[7] | Nispel favored shooting the film in California, but Nispel suggested Texas, where he had previously shot three films.[8] Principal photography began in Austin in July 2002[9] and lasted 40 days.[8] The original film was shot in a style more reminiscent of a documentary. Nispel intentionally shot in a different style, using more traditionally narrative elements, as he did not want to make a shot-for-shot remake, as in Gus van Sant's Psycho remake.[10] The remake includes references to the previous film, including John Larroquette, who returns in his role as the film's narrator.[11] | The weather during filming was very hot and humid. Bryniarski, who portrays Leatherface in the film, did all his own stunts and was forced to wear a \"fat suit\", which increased his near-300 lbs to 420 lbs. The suit also heated up quickly so that the actor had to ensure that he drank a lot of fluids before a shoot. Leatherface's mask was also a problem; the mask was made out of Silicone and was difficult for the actor to breathe through. The crew had many prop chainsaws for actor Bryniarski to use, such as chainsaws that put out smoke, and live chainsaws.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  by Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper","m_directed_by":"Marcus Nispel","m_produced_by":"Michael Bay | Mike Fleiss | Brad Fuller | Kim Henkel | Tobe Hooper","m_screenplay_by":"Scott Kosar","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Larroquette","m_music_by":"Steve Jablonsky","m_cinematography":"Daniel Pearl","m_edited_by":"Glen Scantlebury","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"New Line Cinema","m_release_dates":"October 17, 2003 (2003-10-17) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"98 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$9.5 million[2]","m_box_office":"$107.1 million[3] | The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a 2003 American slasher film, and a remake of the The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.
