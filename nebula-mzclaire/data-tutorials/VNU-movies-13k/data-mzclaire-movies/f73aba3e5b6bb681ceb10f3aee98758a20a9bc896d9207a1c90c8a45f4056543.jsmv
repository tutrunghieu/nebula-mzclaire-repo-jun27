{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A pirate named Burger-Beard (Antonio Banderas) travels to the island of Bikini Atoll to obtain a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. The book tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants, a childlike sea sponge who loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab fast food restaurant and faithfully guards the secret Krabby Patty formula from Plankton, the owner of the Chum Bucket and business rival to Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Squidward's boss. | The Krusty Krab is attacked by Plankton; after a military battle with giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender: he uses a decoy of himself to offer the greedy Mr. Krabs a fake penny, which he hides inside to gain access to Krabs' vault. The Plankton decoy distracts Mr. Krabs by crying outside the restaurant so he can gloat about his victory. Plankton steals the formula, leaving a fake in its place; however, just as he is about to escape, SpongeBob catches him and they both have a tug of war over the formula, but it magically vanishes before either can claim it. | With the secret formula gone, SpongeBob is unable to make Krabby Patties, and the customers become ravenous. Only SpongeBob knows Plankton is innocent of stealing the formula, and when all of Bikini Bottom turns on them, SpongeBob rescues Plankton with a giant soap bubble that he and Plankton fly away in. Bikini Bottom is soon reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland because of the absence of the much-relied-on Krabby Patty. SpongeBob proposes that he and Plankton team up to get the formula back; he attempts to show Plankton the meaning of teamwork, but he does not quite understand. Eventually, the duo decides to go to the Chum Bucket and rescue Karen so they can use her as a power source for a time machine that will take them to the moment before the formula disappeared. They assemble the machine at an abandoned taco restaurant, but accidentally travel far into the future, where they meet Bubbles, a time-traveling dolphin that watches over our solar system. They eventually succeed in retrieving the formula, but it turns out to be the fake Plankton has left. | Burger-Beard, along with his seagull minions, converts his ship into a food truck to sell Krabby Patties at a beach community named Salty Shoals. The final page, which has been discarded in the ocean, lands on Sandy’s treedome. Crazed by the lack of Krabby Patties, Sandy thinks the page is a sign from the \"sandwich gods\", and suggests a sacrifice be made to appease them. The town attempts to sacrifice SpongeBob, but he and Mr. Krabs smell Krabby Patties, and the crowd follows the scent, which leads to the surface. Bubbles returns because SpongeBob cost him his job as overseer of the universe. In reality, Bubbles hated the job and thanks SpongeBob by allowing him, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Squidward the ability to breathe on land; Plankton joins also, stowed away in SpongeBob's sock. Bubbles shoots them out of his blowhole to the surface, and they land on a beach. | The team locates Burger-Beard, who banishes them to Pelican Island. Using Squidward's ink and the final page, SpongeBob transforms himself and the others into superheroes with special powers — The Invincibubble (SpongeBob), Mr. Superawesomeness (Patrick), Sour Note (Squidward), The Rodent (Sandy), and Sir Pinch-a-Lot (Mr. Krabs). They return and encounter Burger-Beard, who drives off with the formula, which forces the team to give chase. During the ensuing battle, the book is destroyed and the team attempts to apprehend Burger-Beard, who picks the team off one by one. | Plankton, who has been left on Pelican Island, becomes a muscle-bound hero named Plank-Ton and comes to assist them. After retrieving the formula, Plank-Ton and Invincibubble work together to create one final attack that sends Burger-Beard all the way to Bikini Atoll.[8] Plankton, who has learned the values of teamwork, returns the secret formula to Mr. Krabs, and the gang uses the final page's magic to return home to Bikini Bottom. With Krabby Patties back, Bikini Bottom returns to order, and Plankton re-assumes his role as business rival, bringing things back to the status quo.","m_cast":"Antonio Banderas as Burger-Beard the Pirate | Tom Kenny as SpongeBob SquarePants / The Invincibubble[7][7][9] and Gary the Snail | Mr. Lawrence as Plankton / Plank-Ton, Mr. Krabs' arch-rival and Karen's husband | Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs / Sir Pinch-A-Lot, SpongeBob and Squidward's boss | Bill Fagerbakke as Patrick Star / Mr. Superawsomeness, SpongeBob's neighbor and best friend[9] | Rodger Bumpass as Squidward Tentacles / Sour Note[7][9] and Squidosaurus Rex | Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks / The Rodent[7] | Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci as Popsicles | Matt Berry as Bubbles | Jill Talley as Karen, Plankton's computer W.I.F.E. | Dee Bradley Baker as Perch Perkins and other fish characters | Nolan North as Pigeon Cabbie | Paul Tibbitt (US) and Joe Sugg (UK) as Kyle the Seagull | Mary Jo Catlett as Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob's boating school teacher | Peter Shukoff as Painty the Pirate | Lori Alan as Pearl Krabs, Mr. Krabs' daughter (end credits only) | The seagulls were voiced by Peter Shukoff, Lloyd Ahlquist, Carlos Alazraqui, Eric Bauza, Tim Conway, Eddie Deezen, Nolan North, Rob Paulsen, Kevin Michael Richardson, April Stewart, Cree Summer, Billy West, Alan Carr (UK), Caspar Lee (UK), Stacey Solomon (UK) and Joe Sugg (UK). | Slash also appears in a trailer for the film as himself in the form of a cameo.

It beat out American Sniper, which grossed $23.3 million, marking the first time in four weeks a film other than American Sniper was the top grossing film. In its second weekend, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water earned an estimated $31.4 million, making a 43.2% decline and was overtaken by Fifty Shades of Grey and Kingsman: The Secret Service, dropping to number three. On its third weekend, the film stayed at number three, grossing an estimated $16.5 million. In its fourth weekend, the film was number three again, grossing an estimated $10.8 million.[103] | A week ahead of North America release, the film was released in five markets for the three-day weekend of January 30 in other territories, and earned a gross of $8 million. $6.7 million of that came from a strong debut in Mexico.[104] For its second weekend of February 6, 2015, the film earned itself a gross of $16.2 million playing in theaters of 25 markets. The film opened at #1 in Brazil and Spain by grossing $4.6 million and $1.9 million respectively, while maintaining the top spot at the box office of Mexico by earning $2.4 million.[105] In the UK the film was released on March 27 in time for the Easter school holidays and opened at #3 behind Cinderella and Home. | On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating of 80%, based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's consensus reads, \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water won't win over many viewers who aren't fans of the show, but for the converted, it's another colorful burst of manic fun.\"[106] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[107] According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[108] | Andrew Barker of Variety praised the film for \"never even feigning a lick of seriousness\". Although he felt the film was too long and the CGI sequences to be inferior to the traditionally animated ones, he said the film would prove \"popular among the franchise's key grade-schooler and head-shop-owner demographics.\"[109] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter was more negative, saying the film's two animation styles failed \"to create a cohesive whole in spite of all the inspired non sequiturs,\" stating \"the live action/CG stuff never satisfyingly jibes with the traditional nautical nonsense down below.\" He opined that although the film was inferior to the first one, it would likely be a box office success.[110] Barbara VanDenburgh of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying \"The plot is straightforward, predictable and slight, no more intricate a plot than a 15-minute TV episode would have. It's the freewheeling madness of its execution that makes the movie such a trip - as in acid trip.\"[111] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"The spirit of the series remains true: cheerfully random jokes, blink-and-you'll-miss-them references and, above all, a silly, stubbornly sentimental streak that only the crabbiest cynic could dismiss.\"[112] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water weaves a silly - and often funny - spell. It's a scrappy little B-movie that zips along rather entertainingly.\"[113] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"There's something about this project that, despite checking all of the requisite plot and sensibility boxes, doesn't convey as an organic work of SpongeBob-ishness.\"[114] | Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying \"While less fluid and fresh than its 2004 predecessor, the new film displays enough nutty writing and sheer brio to confirm the stamina of its enduring and skillfully voiced characters.\"[115] Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the film a B+, saying \"The visual effects and fast and furious quips combine for that rarest of releases: one that both parents and kids can enjoy (just like the show), leaving viewers of any age hoping that the next SpongeBob movie isn't an entire decade off.\"[116] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a positive review, saying \"The jokes are consistently hilarious, with enough variety to tickle the funny bones of old salts and young fishies alike.\"[117] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The live-action elements — mostly in the person of Antonio Banderas as cranky pirate Burger Beard, who spends most of his time addressing a flock of seagulls — don't mesh seamlessly with the animated sequences. It almost feels like two movies awkwardly melded together.\"[118] John Semley of The Globe and Mail gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water mostly nails what has always made the character, and his brightly coloured underwater world, so endearing: the abundant innocence, the welcome lack of cynicism and the out-and-out stupidity.\"[119] Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water remains true to the surrealism of its animated television roots. But it also tries to force a live-action element which isn't as comfortable a fit as a certain pair of symmetrical trousers.\"[120]","m_production":"Following the release of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie in 2004, producer Julia Pistor stated that a sequel film was unlikely, despite the film's successful box office performance.[11] In a 2009 interview with Digital Spy, SpongeBob SquarePants writer and executive producer Paul Tibbitt was asked about the possibility of a sequel.[12] He said, \"I think that they are talking about doing that, but I haven't signed up for anything. We just feel like we've told so many stories, and SpongeBob exists so well in this short 11-minute form.\"[12] He further stated that making another film was \"a huge challenge.\"[12] However, Tibbitt denied that a sequel is not impossible to emerge, saying \"I wouldn't say no, but I don't know if there will be another one.\"[12] In 2010, Nickelodeon reportedly had been approaching the crews of the show to make another film adaptation.[13] The network had long wanted to partner with Paramount Pictures to release another SpongeBob SquarePants film to help reinvigorate the series from its declining ratings.[14] However, internal disagreement delayed collaborations.[13][14] | On March 4, 2011, in an article by the Los Angeles Times, it was first reported that Paramount had \"another SpongeBob picture\" in development.[15] Several months later, in July, Paramount formed its new animation unit, Paramount Animation, in the wake of the commercial and critical success of the 2011 computer-animated film Rango, and the departure of DreamWorks Animation upon completion of their distribution contract in 2012.[16] Philippe Dauman, the president and CEO of Paramount and Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom, officially announced on February 28, 2012 that a sequel film was in development and slated for an unspecified 2014 release, saying that \"We will be releasing a SpongeBob movie at the end of 2014.\"[17][18][19] Dauman added that the film \"will serve to start off or be one of our films that starts off our new animation effort.\"[17] Nickelodeon expected the film to do much better in foreign box office than the 2004 feature, given its increasingly global reach.[14][20] Dauman said, \"This will continue to propel SpongeBob internationally.\"[14] | Production was announced on June 10, 2014 under the title The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 2,[21][22] which some trade publications began referring to as SpongeBob SquarePants 2.[7] The film's executive producer is series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who departed from the show as its showrunner in 2004 following the release of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. He no longer writes or runs the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviews each episode and delivers suggestions.[23][24] However, in a 2012 interview with Thomas F. Wilson, Hillenburg stated that he was helping in writing the film.[25] Tibbitt later revealed on Twitter in late 2013 that \"Steve [Hillenburg] and I wrote the new movie together and he has been in the studio everyday working with us.\"[26] Production on the film was expected to finish in November 2014.[27] | The regular series main cast members returned to reprise their roles from the series and the previous 2004 film.[7] In August 2013, casting directors from Marty Siu Casting began casting calls for the background extras for the live action scenes.[28][29] On September 21, 2013, it was reported that Spanish actor Antonio Banderas had been cast for a live action role as Burger-Beard the pirate.[30][31][32] | The animation for the film was handled overseas by Rough Draft Korea in South Korea.[33] Vincent Waller said, \"We're getting animation back that is looking terrific.\"[34] The sequel is a combination of traditional animation and live action as its predecessor was,[35][36] and also used computer-generated imagery (CGI) handled by Iloura VFX in Melbourne, Australia to render the characters in 3D.[37][38] Sherm Cohen returned to work on the sequel, when he previously worked on The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie as a character designer and the lead storyboard artist and left the show in 2005.[39] Series animation directors Tom Yasumi and Alan Smart worked on the film's exposure sheets.[40] Most of the character layout crew of the film are from the series.[41] | In a preview of upcoming Paramount films held in 2012, it first exhibited the film as a \"3D feature film\" with \"CGI-like animation\".[42] Following the release of the SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D: The Great Jelly Rescue, a 3D short film released in early 2013 at the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando, executives also talked of perpetuating the 3D stereoscopy in the film.[43] Director Tibbitt was asked on Twitter concerning what animation technique the film would have, and responded, \"[I] don't wanna spoil anything but [it is] mostly 2D.\"[44] | The film contains a stop-motion animation sequence by Screen Novelties.[45][46] | In March 2014, Paramount screened live action footage from the film during the National Association of Theatre Owners' CinemaCon. News websites report that the film would be CGI-animated,[47] with an Internet Movie Database staff commenting, \"When Paramount announced there would be a new SpongeBob SquarePants movie, the assumption was that it would be animated (like all other incarnations of SpongeBob). The very brief footage from tonight's presentation suggested otherwise – it looked as though this was a CGI/live-action hybrid akin to Alvin and the Chipmunks, Yogi Bear, The Smurfs, etc.\"[48] In an article published by ComingSoon.net, author Edward Douglas wrote: \"The CGI animation just looks weird.\"[49] Philippe Duaman said that the CGI elements are intended to \"refresh and give another boost\" to the characters.[50] | The film features live action scenes directed by Mike Mitchell.[51] Filming began on September 30, 2013 and lasted through November 5, 2013, on various locations in Savannah, Georgia and Tybee Island.[52][53][54] The Savannah Film Office first announced that the film would shoot live action scenes in Savannah for 40 days on July 11, 2013.[36] Will Hammargren, location specialist for the Savannah Film Office, said the film was expected to contribute $8 million to the city's economy, including booking at least 5,600 hotel room nights.[55][56] | On September 30, 2013, the start of production filming was interrupted when Jay Self was dismissed.[57][58] According to a memorandum from Joe Shearouse, bureau chief of the leisure services department of Savannah, Self was fired for his \"failure to properly plan and manage the arrangement for the movie.\"[57][59] It accused Self of shortcomings surrounding the filming and also cited complaints from local residents of Savannah.[57][59][60][61] Another reported reason for Self's dismissal was a disagreement between Paramount and the Savannah Film Office, about the deal of granting the local businesses to negotiate with Paramount for potential business losses during filming.[62] | In preparing the filming location in the downtown, the film crew painted storefronts along Broughton Street to resemble a \"beach community\" called \"Salty Shoals\".[55][63][64][65] Jay Self said, \"They're trying to make it look like it's right at the seaside.\"[64] The Jen Library and Trustees Theater, a landmark situated on Broughton Street, of the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) was converted into a sea museum.[63] Paramount first approached SCAD to utilize the Jen Library for a scene back in August 2013.[66] Once SCAD approved, the studio's art department transformed the buildings in choice for the film.[66] It remained open to students during filming, while the \"SCAD\" letters atop Trustees remained untouched.[66] Other establishments, like flower shops, convenience stores and coffeehouses, were converted to surfing, fudge and buoy shops, respectively.[67] Self said, \"The changes are temporary with all buildings scheduled to be restored to their original colors after filming is complete.\"[64][68] | Filming began on October 9 in the downtown where parts of the Broughton Street between Montgomery Street and Habersham Street were closed through October 18.[63][69][70] Prior to October 9, residents were given yellow flyers handed out by the production crew to detail the inconveniences of the filming would have on them.[71] Actor Antonio Banderas appeared as a pirate and was filmed on a pirate ship with wheels for a car chase scene.[63][71][72] At one point, a film crew member caused an accident that damaged a downtown building and rushed a woman to the Candler Hospital.[73][74] William Hammargren, with the Savannah Film Services office, said that Paramount was issued a permit to use motorized vehicles within certain areas closed for filming, but the permit did not extend to the lanes.[73] | Filming in the downtown ended on October 18, when a raffle was also held, with City Mayor Edna Jackson announcing the winners.[75] The prizes include: a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed party, bicycles, a vacation at Marshall House, dinner at Savannah Bistro, gift certificates, and a 60-inch television.[75] After filming in the downtown, the production received mixed response from local businesses located in filming areas.[62] A concern raised by business owners was the choice in dates for shooting as October is \"a big month for merchants along Broughton.\"[62] Some merchants suggested February, July, or August as prime filming dates.[62] | Filming for the scenes resumed on October 21 on Tybee Island.[75][76] The producers of the film were permitted to film on Tybee Island after meetings held at the Tybee Island City Hall with businesses and residents that imposed concerns about the possible effects of the filming, and also apprehensions about sea turtle safety.[77][78] Musician Slash of the band Guns N' Roses was seen on set at the Tybee Pier for filming, although he does not appear in the final film.[79] The film crew later moved to Strand Avenue for a chase scene with extras on bicycles.[79]","m_sequel":"In a February 2015 interview discussing the film's financial success, Megan Collison, president of worldwide distribution and marketing at Paramount, stated the possibility of a third film was \"a good bet\".[124] In another interview, Paramount vice chairman Rob Moore remarked, \"Hopefully, it won't take 10 years to make another film.\"[125] On April 30, 2015, via Twitter, Viacom announced a third SpongeBob SquarePants film was in development.[126] On August 3, 2015, via Twitter, Vincent Waller confirmed that the sequel is in pre-production and that Paul Tibbitt will direct from a story by him and Kyle McCulloch.[127] It will be released on February 8, 2019.[128] On November 11, 2015, Waller confirmed via Twitter that the film will be mostly traditionally animated with CGI/live-action sequences.[129] On January 29, 2016, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger revealed that they would be working on the third movie.[130]","m_based_on":"SpongeBob SquarePants  by Stephen

series SpongeBob SquarePants. A stand-alone sequel to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), it was directed by Paul Tibbitt, with live-action sequences directed by Mike Mitchell. The film stars the regular television cast (Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence), who returned to reprise their respective roles from the series and the previous film and Antonio Banderas.[7] Matt Berry co-stars as Bubbles. The plot follows a pirate called Burger-Beard, who steals the Krabby Patty secret formula using a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, Squidward, Sandy, and Plankton must travel to the surface and confront Burger-Beard in order to get the formula back. | The film was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger from a story conceived by Tibbitt and SpongeBob SquarePants creator Stephen Hillenburg. Like the first film, the final act (which was directed by Mike Mitchell) mixes the animated characters in a live action world. However, in this film, the characters are animated and rendered in computer animation. The live action scenes were shot in various locations throughout Savannah, Georgia and Tybee Island; filming began on October 9, 2013, in the downtown area, where various establishments were changed to resemble a beach community. Filming completed in November 2013. During production (in 2012), actor Ernest Borgnine, the original voice of Mermaid Man, died; the film was dedicated to his memory. It was also the first film to be produced by Paramount Animation. | The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was released in the United States on February 6, 2015. The film grossed over $323 million worldwide against a $74 million budget. It was the 5th highest-grossing animated film of 2015. It was nominated in the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards for \"Favorite Animated Movie\", but lost to Big Hero 6. It is currently the third highest grossing Nickelodeon film, behind The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014).[5] |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=70252 | ^ http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&country=BE&id=spongebob2.htm | ^ http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/SpongeBob-Movie-Sponge-Out-of-Water-The/Belgium#tab=summary | ^ \"THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SPONGE OUT OF WATER (U)\".
