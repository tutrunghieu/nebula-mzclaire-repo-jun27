{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Having stolen some compromising documents from a powerful and successful entrepreneur/gangster at a party, a man known as Fred (Lambert) escapes from the police and takes refuge in the underground world of the Paris Métro stations and tunnels. There he joins the dwellers and befriends several colourful characters, including others who are living under the subway to avoid police arrest. While the gangster's henchmen try to find Fred, he develops a romance with the gangster's young trophy wife Héléna (Adjani). She had originally invited Fred to the party featured at the opening of the film, and is bored with her gilded-caged life. | Fred forms a pop band with some of his friends, such as \"The Drummer\" (Reno) and Enrico (Serra), who compose the songs. While Fred is working on this project, Héléna's powerful husband pressures the police to find the fugitive. One of Fred's sidekicks, The Rollerskater, who has been wanted by the police for a long time, is captured by Commissioner Gesberg (Galabru). Fred and his friend The Florist rob a train carrying money; The Florist escapes, leaving Fred with the loot. | Fred uses money from the robbery to pay off a band scheduled to perform in the subway station. His new band replaces them but, at their performance, Fred is searched for by both the police and a henchman of Héléna's husband. The henchman shoots Fred just as Héléna was about to reach and warn him of danger. The film ends with Héléna kneeling beside Fred, who is lying on his back, looking content and singing along with the band. They are playing and being applauded by the audience in the background.","m_cast":"Isabelle Adjani as Héléna | Christopher Lambert (as Christophe Lambert) as Fred | Richard Bohringer as The Florist | Michel Galabru as/Commissioner Gesberg | Jean-Hugues Anglade as The Roller | Jean Bouise as The Station Master | Jean-Pierre Bacri as Inspector Batman | Jean-Claude Lecas as Robin | Pierre-Ange Le Pogam as Jean | Jean Reno as The Drummer | Éric Serra as Enrico (bassist)","m_reception":"Subway was the third-most popular French film in France in 1986, after Trois Hommes et un Couffin and Les Specialistes.
