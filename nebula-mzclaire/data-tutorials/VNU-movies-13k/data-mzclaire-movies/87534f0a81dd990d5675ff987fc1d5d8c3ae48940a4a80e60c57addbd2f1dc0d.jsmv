{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a popular young Hollywood director of profitable but shallow comedies (e.g. Ants in Your Plants of 1939). Sullivan is dissatisfied despite his success and tells his studio boss, Mr. Lebrand (Robert Warwick) that he wants his next project to be a serious exploration of the plight of the downtrodden. He asks to make his next film an adaptation of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a socially-conscious novel. Lebrand wants him to direct another lucrative comedy instead, but the idealistic Sullivan refuses to give in. He wants to \"know trouble\" first-hand, and plans to travel as a tramp so he can return and make a film that truly depicts the sorrows of humanity. His butler (Robert Greig) and valet (Eric Blore) openly question the wisdom of his plan. | Sullivan dresses as a penniless hobo and takes to the road, followed by a fully staffed double-decker coach at Lebrand's request. Neither party is happy with the arrangement; and Sullivan eventually persuades his guardians to leave him alone and arranges to rendezvous with them in Las Vegas later. However, when he hitchhikes alone, he finds himself back in Los Angeles where he started. | There he meets a young failed actress (Veronica Lake, credited only as \"The Girl\") who is just about to quit the business and go home. She believes he is truly a tramp, and buys him a breakfast of eggs and ham. In return for her kindness, Sullivan retrieves his car from his estate and gives her a lift. He neglects to tell his servants that he has returned; so they report the \"theft\" of the car and Sullivan and the Girl are apprehended by the police. Upon their release, the Girl pushes him into his enormous swimming pool for deceiving her about his true identity. However, after considering her options, she becomes his traveling companion. | This time Sullivan succeeds in living like a hobo. After eating in soup kitchens and sleeping in homeless shelters with the Girl, Sullivan finally decides he has had enough. His experiment is publicized by the studio as a huge success. The Girl wants to stay with him, but is stymied by his complicated living situation. On the advice of his business manager, Sullivan had gotten married to reduce his income tax. Ironically, he discovers that his wife cost him double what he saved in taxes. | Sullivan decides to thank the homeless by handing out $5 bills, but one man decides he wants more than his share and ambushes Sullivan when he is alone, taking the cash and Sullivan's shoes. Sullivan is knocked unconscious and thrown onto a train boxcar leaving the city. The thief drops the loose cash on the rails then is run over and killed by another train while picking it up. When the thief's body is found, they discover a special identification card in his shoes identifying him as Sullivan. The mangled body is assumed to be Sullivan's, and his staff and the Girl are informed of his death. | Meanwhile, Sullivan wakes up in the rail yard of another city, with no memory of who he is or how he got there. In his confused state, he assaults the railroad worker who finds him, for which he is sentenced to six years in a labor camp. Sullivan slowly regains his memory. While in the labor camp, Sullivan attends a showing of Walt Disney's Playful Pluto cartoon. Looking at the pure joy in the audience's faces, Sullivan realizes that comedy can do more good for the poor than his proposed social drama, O Brother, Where Art Thou?. | But Sullivan still has a problem â€“ he cannot convince anybody that he is Sullivan. Finally, he comes up with an ingenious solution: he confesses to being his own killer. When his picture makes the front page of the newspapers, the Girl recognizes him and gets him released. His \"widow\" had already taken up with his crooked business manager, so he can now divorce her and be reunited with the Girl. A montage of happily laughing faces ends the film.","m_cast":"Joel McCrea as John L.

Eric Blore had appeared in The Lady Eve and Porter Hall would go on to appear in three other Sturges films: The Great Moment, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek and The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend, Sturges's last American film. | Preston Sturges has a cameo appearance as the film director in the scene set in a film studio where The Girl sees Sullivan's picture in the paper and recognizes him. The man she almost runs into on the street outside the studio is Ray Milland.[5] | Another member of the production staff appeared in the film as well: associate producer Paul Jones appeared as \"Dear Joseph\", the late husband of \"Miz Zeffie\", in a photograph in which the man's expression changes.[5]","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Paramount purchased Sturges's script for Sullivan's Travels for $6,000. He wrote the film as a response to the \"preaching\" he found in other comedies \"which seemed to have abandoned the fun in favor of the message.\"[5] Sturges may have been influenced by the stories of John Garfield,[6] who lived the life of a hobo, riding freight trains and hitchhiking his way cross country for a short period in the 1930s. Sturges wrote the film with Joel McCrea in mind, but found the female lead through the casting process. Barbara Stanwyck was considered, as well as Frances Farmer.[5] | The film as released opens with a dedication: | To the memory of those who made us laugh: the motley mountebanks, the clowns, the buffoons, in all times and in all nations, whose efforts have lightened our burden a little, this picture is affectionately dedicated. | This was originally intended to be spoken by Sullivan. Sturges wanted the film to begin with the prologue: \"This is the story of a man who wanted to wash an elephant. The elephant darn near ruined him.\"[5] Paramount contracted with the Schlesinger Corp., who made the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, to make an animated main title sequence, but this was not used in the film, if it was ever actually produced.[5] | The censors at the Hays Office had objections to the script which the studio submitted to them. They felt that the word \"bum\" would be rejected by British censors, and warned that there should be no \"suggestion of sexual intimacy\" between Sullivan and The Girl in the scenes in which they are sleeping together at the mission.[5] | Sullivan's Travels went into production on 12 May 1941 and wrapped on 22 July.[7] Location shooting took place in Canoga Park, San Marino, Castaic and at Lockheed Air Terminal.[5] | Veronica Lake was six months pregnant at the beginning of production, a fact she didn't tell Sturges until filming began. Sturges was so furious when he learned that, according to Lake, he had to be physically restrained.[8] Sturges consulted with Lake's doctor to see if she could perform the part, and hired former Tournament of Roses queen Cheryl Walker as Lake's double.[5] Edith Head, Hollywood's most renowned costume designer, was tasked to find ways of concealing Lake's condition. Reportedly, Lake was disliked by some of her co-stars; McCrea refused to work with her again, turning down a lead role in I Married a Witch, and Fredric March, who got the part, didn't get along with her as well.[9] McCrea got along famously, however, with Sturges, and afterward presented him with a watch engraved \"for the finest direction I've ever had.\" Sturges' assistant director, Anthony Mann, was also heavily influenced by the production.[10] | There were some minor problems during filming. Sturges had wanted to use a clip from a Charlie Chaplin film for the church scene, but was turned down by Chaplin. McCrea does parody Chaplin's \"Little Tramp\" character earlier in the film.[5] Also, the \"Poverty Montage\" was scheduled to take three hours to film, but instead took seven hours. Incidents such as this may account for the film, which cost more than $689,000 to produce, going more than $86,000 over budget.[5] | The film was first screened for critics on December 4, 1941.[11] Its public premiere occurred on January 28, 1942, in New York City at the New York Paramount Theatre.[1] Its Hollywood premiere occurred two weeks later on February 12, 1942, at the Los Angeles Paramount Theatre.[12] | When the film was released, the U.S. government's Office of Censorship declined to approve it for export overseas during wartime, because of the \"long sequence showing life in a prison chain gang which is most objectionable because of the brutality and inhumanity with which the prisoners are treated.\" This conformed with the office's standing policy of not exporting films which could be used for propaganda purposes by the enemy. The producers of the film declined to make suggested changes which could have altered the film's status.[5] | Sullivan's Travels was released on video in the U.S. on 16 March 1989, and re-released on 30 June 1993. The film was re-released in the UK with a restored print on 12 May 2000.[13]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Preston Sturges","m_produced_by":"Paul Jones Buddy DeSylva (uncredited) Preston Sturges (uncredited)","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Joel McCrea Veronica Lake","m_music_by":"Charles Bradshaw Leo Shuken","m_cinematography":"John Seitz","m_edited_by":"Stuart Gilmore","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Paramount Pictures","m_release_dates":"JanuaryÂ 28,Â 1942Â (1942-01-28) (US) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"90 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$676,687[2]","m_box_office":"$1,150,000 (US rentals)[3] | Sullivan's Travels is a 1942[1] American comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges.
