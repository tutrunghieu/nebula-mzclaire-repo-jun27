{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Eddie and Michael are two 16-year-old best friends on the brink of adulthood. They are both gay, but hold diametrically opposed outlooks on life. Eddie likes watching old films on video with his mother. Michael likes video games and the street. They are total opposites that argue like an old married couple. Leaving behind the grim, oppressive reality of Liverpool (in the 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were amongst the highest in the UK), they stumble into the bizarre fantasy world of a transvestite nightclub called The Fruit Machine, run by \"Annabelle\". There, they witness a brutal gangland murder by Echo that transforms their quest for adventure into a run for their lives. Alone and afraid, yet hopeful, they wind up in Brighton with Vincent and Eve at Wonderland, where their path is strewn with manipulation, deceit and murder.","m_cast":"Emile Charles - Eddie | Tony Forsyth - Michael | Robert Stephens - Vincent | Robbie Coltrane - \"Annabelle\" | Clare Higgins - Eve | Bruce Payne - Echo | Carsten Norgaard - Dolphin Man | Kim Christie - Jean | Louis Emerick - Billy | Julie Graham - Hazel | Forbes Collins - John Schlesinger","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The younger brother of actor Craig Charles, Emile Charles plays the role of Eddie. | The film was shot on location in Liverpool, Brighton and London.
