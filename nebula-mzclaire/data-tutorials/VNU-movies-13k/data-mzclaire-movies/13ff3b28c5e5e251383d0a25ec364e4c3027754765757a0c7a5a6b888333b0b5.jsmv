{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"The film is set in an Upper East Side apartment in New York City in the late 1960s. Michael, a Roman Catholic sporadically employed writer and recovering alcoholic, is preparing to host a birthday party for his friend Harold. Another of his friends, Donald, a self-described underachiever who has moved from the city, arrives and helps Michael prepare. Alan, Michael's (presumably straight) old college roommate from Georgetown, calls with an urgent need to see Michael. Michael reluctantly agrees and invites him to come over. | One by one, the guests arrive. Emory is a stereotypical flamboyant interior decorator; Hank, a soon-to-be-divorced schoolteacher, and Larry, a fashion photographer, are a couple, albeit one with monogamy issues; and Bernard is an amiable black bookstore clerk. Alan calls again to inform Michael that he won't be coming after all, and the party continues in a festive manner. But, unexpectedly, Alan has decided to drop by after all, and his arrival throws the gathering into turmoil. | \"Cowboy\" — a hustler and Emory's \"gift\" to Harold — arrives. As tensions mount, Alan assaults Emory and in the ensuing chaos Harold finally makes his grand appearance. In the midst of the scuffle, Michael impulsively begins drinking again. As the guests become more and more intoxicated, hidden resentments begin to surface, and the party moves indoors from the patio due to a sudden downpour. | Michael, who believes Alan is a closeted homosexual, begins a telephone game in which the objective is for each guest to call the one person whom he truly believes he has loved. With each call, past scars and present anxieties are revealed. Bernard reluctantly attempts to call the son of his mother's employer, with whom he'd had a sexual encounter as a teenager, while Emory calls a dentist on whom he'd had a crush while in high school. Bernard and Emory immediately regret having made the phone calls. Hank and Larry attempt to call one another (via two phone lines in Michael's apartment). Michael's plan to \"out\" Alan with the game appears to backfire when Alan calls his wife, not the male college friend Justin Stewart whom Michael had presumed to be Alan's lover. As the party ends and the guests depart, Michael collapses into Donald's arms, sobbing. When he pulls himself together, it appears his life will remain very much the same.","m_cast":"Kenneth Nelson as Michael | Leonard Frey as Harold | Cliff Gorman as Emory | Laurence Luckinbill as Hank | Frederick Combs as Donald | Keith Prentice as Larry | Robert La Tourneaux as Cowboy Tex | Reuben Greene as Bernard | Peter White as Alan McCarthy | Maud Adams (uncredited) as photo model | Elaine Kaufman (uncredited) as extra/pedestrian","m_reception":null,"m_production":"Mart Crowley and Dominick Dunne set up the film version of the play with Cinema Center Films, owned by CBS Television. Crowley was paid $250,000 plus a percentage of the profits for the film rights; in addition to this, he received a fee for writing the script.[2] | Crowley and Dunne originally wanted the play's director, Robert Moore, to direct the film but Gordon Stulberg, head of Cinema Center, was reluctant to entrust the job to someone who had never made a movie before. They decided on William Friedkin who had just made a film of The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter that impressed them.[3] | Friedkin rehearsed for two weeks with the cast. He shot a scene that was offstage in the play where Hank and Larry kiss passionately; the actors who played them were reluctant to do this on film but eventually decided to. Friedkin then cut it in editing feeling it was over-sensationalistic; he says now he wishes he had kept it in.[4] | The bar scene in the opening was filmed at Julius in Greenwich Village.[5] Studio shots were at the Chelsea Studios in New York City.[6] According to commentary by Friedkin on the 2008 DVD release, Michael's apartment was inspired by the real-life Upper East Side apartment of actress Tammy Grimes. (Grimes was a personal friend of Mart Crowley.) Most of the patio scenes were filmed at Grimes' home. The actual apartment interior would not allow for filming, given its size and other technical factors, so a replica of Grimes' apartment was built on the Chelsea Studios sound stage, and that is where the interior scenes were filmed. | Songs featured in the film include \"Anything Goes\" performed by Harpers Bizarre during the opening credits, \"Good Lovin' Ain't Easy to Come By\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, \"Funky Broadway\" by Wilson Pickett, \"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\" by Martha and the Vandellas, and an instrumental version of Burt Bacharach's \"The Look of Love\".","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Boys in the Band  by Mart Crowley","m_directed_by":"William Friedkin","m_produced_by":"Mart Crowley Kenneth Utt Dominick Dunne Robert Jiras","m_screenplay_by":"Mart Crowley","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Kenneth Nelson Leonard Frey Cliff Gorman Laurence Luckinbill Frederick Combs Keith Prentice Robert La Tourneaux Reuben Greene Peter White","m_music_by":null,"m_cinematography":"Arthur J.
