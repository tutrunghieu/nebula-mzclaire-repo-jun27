{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1960s Philadelphia, Perry Parker (Joe Pantoliano) is a local dance-show host who aspires to rival Dick Clark. Del Green (Donovan Leitch) is an honors student who dreams about dancing with Vicky (Jennifer Runyon), the show's most popular dancer who attends a parochial school. However Vicky is in love with her dancing partner Dugan (Scott Plank). | Del sneaks to the sound stage right at the day when Dugan misses the show. Someone from the ‘In Crowd’, a group of show's featured dancers, needs to step up as Vicky’s partner, but the other boys are hesitating, knowing Dugan's bad temper. Del takes the chance and his first appearance with Vicky is a big hit. His school friends can’t believe that Del is so hip and ‘alive’ while dancing, but Del's next door neighbor and childhood friend Gail (Wendy Gazelle), who has a crush on Del, is not happy with his new acquaintances and considers them the 'wrong crowd' for him. | Del is accepted to the ‘In Crowd’ and Perry requires Del to attend their evening outing with Vicky. Del picks up Vicky at her home and her father Tiny, a policeman, is happy to see her with a smart college bound young man, a sharp contrast with Dugan who can barely read. However at the outing Vicky sneaks away with Dugan, and Del is waiting until she returns and takes her home to alleviate Tiny's suspicions. There are several more outings, but each time Vicky runs off with Dugan. Del feels used by Vicky and refuses to be a party to her secret romance. Eventually they make up, and Del learns that Vicky and Dugan plan to run off to Hollywood and become movie stars, and vows to help them. | Perry's show is cancelled and the ‘In Crowd’ give their last wild dance. Del then borrows a Cadillac from Geil so he can get Vicky out to meet up with Dugan. Tiny tries to stop the couple and Del crashes into Tiny's police car, helping Vicky escape on Dugan’s motorcycle. | As a consequence, Del is grounded in his room. Gail comes by to play a new kind of music - rock music. She wears a leather headband, mini-skirt and high top suede boots, and Del is stunned by her new appearance as they listen to Bob Dylan.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Mark Rosenthal","m_produced_by":"Keith Rubinstein John F.
