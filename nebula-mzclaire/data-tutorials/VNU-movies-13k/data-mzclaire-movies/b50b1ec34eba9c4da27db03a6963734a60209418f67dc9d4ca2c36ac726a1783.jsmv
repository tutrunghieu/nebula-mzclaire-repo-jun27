{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Johnny and Adam are teenage surfers who live in Los Angeles with their father, Mac. Two weeks before Johnny's 16th birthday, ninjas attack the teenagers, but they are defeated by Zatch, a mysterious warrior with an eye patch. A follow-up attack results in Mac's kidnapping, though Zatch is able to protect the teenagers and their friend Iggy from the ninjas. Adam discovers that the video game on his Sega Game Gear matches the events happening around him and finds he can control some events through his Sega. Zatch reveals to Johnny and Adam that they are actually the sons of the king of Patusan, whose land and monarchy was overthrown by the evil Colonel Chi when the boys were young. It is their destiny to return to Patusan, overthrow Colonel Chi, and free the people. Zatch takes them to the Patusani district in Los Angeles, where Johnny is introduced to a Patusani princess, Ro-May, who has been betrothed to Johnny since they were infants. | Ninjas again attack, but Johnny's abilities as a warrior prince emerge and he defeats several of his foes. Johnny, Adam, Iggy, Zatch, and Ro-May decide to return to Patusan. They are followed by a Los Angeles detective, Lieutenant Spence, who had been investigating the ninja attacks. They reach Patusan and discover what Colonel Chi's rule has wrought, including a burned village and a chain gang of political prisoners. The guards spot them and they are forced to fight. Johnny and Adam defeat them and free the villagers from their captivity. | Zatch leads the crew to a hidden cave in which the ancient weapons of the Patusani monarchy are preserved. Zatch arms Johnny and attacks him to prepare him for future challenges. Johnny is beaten repeatedly, but he is finally able to disarm Zatch. They rally the villagers and they travel to the coast opposite from an island that houses the royal city and Colonel Chi's dungeon. Unable to go by boat due to an impassable reef, Johnny and Adam tell the Patusanis to make surfboards. They then paddle to the unguarded side of the island. | Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch lead the attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, successfully defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":"Surf Ninjas was filmed during the summer of 1992.[1] Filming locations included Thailand and Hawaii.[2] The second half of the film was shot first, and the crew moved to Los Angeles to film the first half.[1] New Line Cinema and Sega of America established a financial relationship in which a Sega Game Gear video game would be developed for the film. Game designers began developing the video game Surf Ninjas when the film was only in its scripting phase, receiving creative input from director Neal Israel.[3] In turn, Sega partially financed the film. Screenwriter Dan Gordon said that he wrote action sequences that would both suit the film and serve as a springboard for the video game.[4] In the film, one of the lead characters is shown playing the Surf Ninjas video game on a Sega Game Gear. The video game was released before the film's release, and it was considered the first movie-based video game to be developed concurrent with the movie and it was also the first to precede the film itself.[3] | Surf Ninjas video games were also released for the Amiga 1200 computer[5] and related CD32 console[6] in 1994 by Flair Software/MicroValue. These versions received mostly negative reviews.[7]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Neal Israel","m_produced_by":"Evzen Kolar","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Ernie Reyes, Jr. | Rob Schneider | Leslie Nielsen","m_music_by":"David Kitay","m_cinematography":"Arthur Albert | Victor Hammer","m_edited_by":"Tom Walls","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"New Line Cinema","m_release_dates":"August 20, 1993 (1993-08-20) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"87 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":"$4.9 million | Surf Ninjas is a 1993 American comedic family film involving martial arts, directed by Neal Israel and written by Dan Gordon.
