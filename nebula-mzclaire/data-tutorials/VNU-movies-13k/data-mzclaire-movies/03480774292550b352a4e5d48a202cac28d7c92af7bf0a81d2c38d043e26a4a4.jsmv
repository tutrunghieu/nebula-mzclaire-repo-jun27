{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Freddie Quell is a sex-obsessed alcoholic World War II veteran from Lynn, Massachusetts, struggling to adjust to post-war society. By 1950, he has become a portrait photographer at a department store, but he is soon fired for getting into a drunken fight with a customer. Freddie then finds work at a Salinas, California cabbage farm, but his moonshine poisons one of the elderly Filipino migrant workers and he is chased off. | One night, intoxicated, Freddie finds himself in San Francisco and stows away on the yacht of a follower of Lancaster Dodd, the leader of a nascent philosophical movement known as \"The Cause.\" When he is discovered, Dodd describes Freddie as \"aberrated\" and invites him to stay and attend the marriage of his daughter, Elizabeth, as long as he will make more of his mysterious brew (made with paint thinner), which Dodd has developed a taste for. Dodd begins an exercise with Freddie called Processing, a flurry of disturbing psychological questions aimed at conquering Freddie's past traumas. Freddie reveals that his father is dead, his mother is institutionalized, he had an incestuous relationship with his aunt, and he abandoned the love of his life, a young girl named Doris, who wrote to him while he was at war. Freddie is enthralled by Dodd, who doesn't flinch from his abject revelations, and Dodd sees something in Freddie. Freddie travels with Dodd's family as they spread the teachings of \"The Cause\" along the East Coast. Dodd and his family, with Freddie tagging along, stay as guests in the homes of various women drawn to \"The Cause.\" But when at a dinner party in New York, a man questions Dodd's methods and statements, Freddie pursues him to his apartment and assaults him that night. | Other members of \"The Cause\" begin to worry about Freddie's behavior, despite Dodd's attachment to him. While they are guests of an acolyte in Philadelphia, Dodd's wife Peggy tells Freddie that he must quit drinking if he wishes to stay, to which he agrees. However, he has no true intention of keeping his promise. Freddie criticizes Dodd's son Val for disregarding his father's teachings, but Val tells Freddie that Dodd is making things up as he goes along. Dodd is arrested for practicing medicine without proper qualifications, after one of his former hostesses has a change of heart; Freddie is also arrested for assaulting the police officers. In the jail cell adjacent to Dodd, Freddie smashes the toilet and batters himself against the bars and his bunk, while Dodd tries to calm him. Freddie erupts in a tirade, questioning everything that Dodd has taught him and accuses him of being a fake. The two men trade insults until Dodd turns his back. They reconcile upon their release, but members of \"The Cause\" have become more suspicious and fearful of Freddie, believing him to be deranged or an undercover agent. | Freddie submits to additional exercises with \"The Cause\" but becomes increasingly angry and frustrated with the repetition of the exercises and his lack of results. Eventually he passes the tests, and they travel to Phoenix, Arizona, for the release of Dodd's latest book. But when Dodd's publisher criticizes the quality of the book and its teachings, Freddie assaults him. Helen Sullivan, their Philadelphia hostess, confronts Dodd in the lecture hall for suggesting that members should now \"imagine\" rather than \"recall\" the experiences of \"other lives\" in his new book, and he also loses his temper. During another exercise, in which Freddie is supposed to ride a motorcycle at high speed through the desert towards an object in the distance and then return, he instead abandons the group, riding the motorcycle out of the desert, and leaving Dodd and \"The Cause\" behind. He goes home to rekindle his relationship with Doris but learns from her mother that she has married and started a family in Alabama in the seven years since he last saw her. Freddie leaves disappointed. | While sleeping in a movie theater, Freddie receives a phone call (or dreams that he has) from Dodd, who is now residing in England. Freddie is asked to come join him. When Freddie arrives, he discovers Val is still in his father's employ and that Elizabeth has been expelled from the movement. Dodd seems happy to see him but Peggy tells him that Freddie has no intention of improving his life and that he should no longer be involved in \"The Cause.\" Dodd changes his countenance, thinking his wife is correct. He gives Freddie an ultimatum: stay with \"The Cause\" and devote himself to it for the rest of his life or leave and never return. Freddie doesn't answer, expressing with silence his refusal. Dodd bitterly comments that Freddie must find a new master, any master, or else his life will have no meaning. Then Dodd serenades Freddie with the song Slow Boat to China. Freddie leaves and picks up a woman at a local pub, then repeats questions from his first processing session with Dodd as he is having sex with her. Finally, he appears to curl up on a beach next to the crude sand sculpture of a woman the sailors built during the war.","m_cast":"Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell | Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd | Amy Adams as Peggy Dodd | Laura Dern as Helen Sullivan | Ambyr Childers as Elizabeth Dodd | Rami Malek as Clark | Jesse Plemons as Val Dodd | Kevin J.

Despite these achievements, the film was not a box office success, and did not make back its $30 million budget.[55] During its first week nationwide, the film grossed $4.4 million in 788 theaters.[56] | Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 225 reviews, with a rating average of 8.1 out of 10. The consensus reads, \"Smart, powerfully acted, beautifully filmed, and solidly engrossing, The Master extends writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's winning streak of challenging films for serious audiences.\"[57] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film ended up receiving a rating average of 86, based on 43 reviews, considered to be \"universally acclaimed\".[58] Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times, in praising Anderson's directing and Phoenix's performance, wrote: \"Phoenix, known for immersing himself in Oscar-nominated roles in Gladiator and Walk the Line, makes Quell frighteningly believable.\" About the film itself, he stated: \"The Master takes some getting used to. This is a superbly crafted film that's at times intentionally opaque, as if its creator didn't want us to see all the way into its heart of darkness.\"[59] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a perfect \"A\" grade, stating: \"It's also one of the great movies of the year - an ambitious, challenging, and creatively hot-blooded, but cool toned project that picks seriously at knotty ideas about American personality, success, rootlessness, master-disciple dynamics, and father-son mutually assured destruction.\"[60] | Peter Rainer of Christian Science Monitor wrote that \"the performances by Phoenix and Hoffman are studies in contrast. Phoenix carries himself with a jagged, lurching, simianlike grace while Hoffman gives Dodd a calm deliberateness. Both actors have rarely been better in the movies. The real Master class here is about acting – and that includes just about everybody else in the film, especially Adams, whose twinkly girl-next-door quality is used here to fine subversive effect.\"[61] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote: \"It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything I've seen recently to being a great movie. There will be skeptics, but the cult is already forming. Count me in.\"[62] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club, giving the film an \"A\" grade, wrote: \"It's a feisty, contentious, deliberately misshapen film, designed to challenge and frustrate audiences looking for a clean resolution. Just because it's over doesn't mean it's settled.\"[63] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film four-stars-out-of-four, praising Anderson's directing: \"The Master, the sixth film from the 42-year-old writer-director, affirms his position as the foremost filmmaking talent of his generation. Anderson is a rock star, the artist who knows no limits.\" About the film itself, he wrote: \"Written, directed, acted, shot, edited and scored with a bracing vibrancy that restores your faith in film as an art form, The Master is nirvana for movie lovers. Anderson mixes sounds and images into a dark, dazzling music that is all his own.\" He would later call the film the Best Film of 2012.[64] | Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the score composed by Jonny Greenwood. He stated: \"In a film overflowing with qualities, but also brimming with puzzlements, two things stand out: the extraordinary command of cinematic technique, which alone is nearly enough to keep a connoisseur on the edge of his seat the entire time, and the tremendous portrayals by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman of two entirely antithetical men, one an unlettered drifter without a clue, the other an intellectual charlatan who claims to have all the answers. They become greatly important to each other and yet, in the end, have an oddly negligible mutual effect. The magesterial [sic] style, eerie mood and forbidding central characters echo Anderson's previous film, There Will Be Blood, a kinship furthered by another bold and discordant score by Jonny Greenwood.\"[65] Justin Chang of Variety magazine wrote: \"The writer-director's typically eccentric sixth feature is a sustained immersion in a series of hypnotic moods and longueurs, an imposing picture that thrillingly and sometimes maddeningly refuses to conform to expectations.\"[66] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three-stars-out-of-four and praised Phoenix's performance, stating: \"Gaunt, sick-looking, with stooped shoulders and a shambling gait, Phoenix buries himself in Freddie's persona and there's never a moment when we disbelieve him.\" He added: \"Yet, for all of The Master's laudable elements, it falls short of greatness for one simple reason: the storytelling is unspectacular.\"[67] | Even less enthusiastic was Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film two-and-a-half-stars of a possible four. He wrote: \"Fabulously well-acted and crafted, but when I reach for it, my hand closes on air. It has rich material and isn't clear what it thinks about it. It has two performances of Oscar caliber, but do they connect?\"[68] Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine gave the film just two stars out of four, stating: \"The Master is Paul Thomas Anderson with the edges sanded off, the best bits shorn down to nubs.\"[69] Rex Reed of the New York Observer gave the film a negative review, writing: \"Call The Master whatever you want, but lobotomized catatonia from what I call the New Hacks can never take the place of well-made narrative films about real people that tell profound stories for a broader and more sophisticated audience. Fads come and go, but as Walter Kerr used to say, 'I'll yell tripe whenever tripe is served.'\" Reed also made mention of how Phoenix's performance and the supporting characters' lack of development further hurt the film.[70] | On Phoenix's performance, Kent Jones of Film Comment noted, \"Freddie is not so much played as nuzzled, and jerked into being by Joaquin Phoenix. I'm Still Here aside, Phoenix's Freddie seems like genuinely damaged goods. He and his director feel their way into this man-in-a-bind from the inside out, and they establish his estrangement from others in those opening scenes through awkward smiles and out-of-sync body language alone\".[71] \"As always with Anderson,\" Jones continued: \"The character opposition borders on the schematic, and the structure threatens to come apart at the seams. But the courting of danger is exactly what makes his films so exciting, this new film most of all. I don't think he has ever done a better job of resolving his story, perhaps because he has come to terms with the irresolution within and between his characters.\"[71] | Emma Dibdin of Total Film gave The Master 5 stars out of 5, concluding that it \"is a breathtaking, singular, technically audacious film, white-hot with emotion, and boasting a few scenes so individually powerful that they’ll stay with you like a physical presence for days.\"[72] | The Master was placed #1 in both the critics poll of the best films of 2012 by Sight and Sound,[73] and by The Village Voice on its annual film poll.[74] The film also ranked second by both Film Comment[75] and Indiewire[76] on their year-end film critics polls, following Holy Motors. | The Master was later placed #1 on The A.V. Club's list of the best films of the 2010s up until April 2015,[77] and was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by The Guardian.[78] | There have been several interpretations of what The Master is really about.[79][80] Some have viewed it as an existential tale of post-war America, while others have viewed it as a depiction of the birth of scientology. Some have argued that the film is also mainly a love story between Lancaster Dodd and Freddie Quell; Dana Stevens of Slate commented that \"After three viewings, I’m still not sure I know the answer to the “what’s it all about” question, but I lean [toward the interpretation that] The Master is above all a love story between Joaquin Phoenix’s damaged WWII vet, Freddie Quell, and Philip Seymour Hoffmann’s charismatic charlatan, Lancaster Dodd. And that relationship is powerful and funny and twisted and strange enough that maybe that’s all the movie needs to be about. \"[81] Others have argued that the film is partly about acting; Richard Brody of the New Yorker observed that \"Similarly, it’s perhaps notable that Phoenix’s performance seems to represent the tormented, physical acting styles of the latter half of the twentieth century (the Brandos, the Deans, the Clifts) whereas Hoffman’s acting seems to hearken back to the controlled, elusive manner of the previous half (many have described his turn as “Wellesian”). In these acting styles, we see a miniature version of the journey of American society during this period — and, specifically, American maleness.\"[82] Still other persuasive arguments regarding the film's main theme is that it's about humanity, and man's struggle to cope with his animalistic nature. Glenn Kenny of MSN Movies wrote that the film is \"Less about [Scientology’s] specific set of beliefs than about how humans rely on belief systems in general to try and lift themselves out of an elemental rage, and to assert, yes, that man is not an animal. \"[83] This story can be also seen as the journey of an authentic being towards enlightenment, Freddy as an exaggerated 'everyman' who progresses from uncontrolled emotion, vulgarity, and a life of flight to one where he takes responsibility for himself, free, and not subject to any 'tyranny', not even the tyranny of his mind and emotions. Freddy is all of us, lost, directionless, indulging, and then he stumbles across a Teacher, Dodd. Dodd himself is not enlightened, he does however understand the goal, and is creating his own process towards it. His students however have been well socialised, as the suits and neat haircuts show, and as Dodd asserts, also crippled in their authenticity by millennia old interference with the human race by some alien culture. Dodd immediately sees that Freddy has an authentic wildness about him, he enjoys their wild adventures together, and when he retrieves his 'life's work' from the desert it is Freddy he chooses to accompany him and carry the work back to the civilised world. His teachings are politely received and lauded by his family, friends, society, but their work to support Dodd is built on their misunderstanding of his work, they have converted it into dogma. They have too much to loose, they are scared to throw themselves totally into the process and rely instead on an intellectual understanding, based on their own belief systems. The only person who throws himself into the process totally and authentically is Freddy, who has nothing to lose, and who recognises 'something' about Dodd that inspires him to great trust and great effort. It is clear from the final 'school in England' scenes that the 'pupils' are taking every thing very seriously, they appear to have created a humourless, conformist culture - a cult. Dodd has lost his anarchic spirit. He has tried to reveal 'the secret' earlier with his second book - the secret is laughter; but this has been poorly received by his students and there is no laughter at the school, only coldness, formality and discipline. Dodd's last speech to Freddy addresses the whole point of the film; 'Free winds and no tyranny for you. Sailor of the seas. You pay no rent.' And Dodd is not warning Freddy in the last scene, as the 'plot description' above suggests. Dodd recognises that Freddy is the only free, authentic person he knows, he is in despair at being caged by his school and students and is not brave enough to walk away. He is asking Freddy: If you discover the way to freedom, if you learn to live without a master, any master, please tell me. Dodd longs to have Freddy's freedom, he sings to Freddy - he would like to just take off with Freddy 'on a slow boat to China'; Dodd is grieving for the loss of his friend and acknowledging how special Freddy has been in his life. Dodd also knows it is time for Freddy to leave - if he doesn't he will just remain another acolyte at the school and his personal journey will come to an end. Freddy is emotional but understands that it is time to part from Dodd; he is parting from his Teacher, leaving the school and entering the everyday world - a major step for all students or disciples; 'now leave here and fly using your own wings'. The last scenes show Freddy in the world again; we see him again occupied with women and alcohol, but now he is a 'drunken Master'; this is a world he knows well. He begins his teaching, just as Dodd offered it to him. | The film won the Silver Lion for Best Director (Paul Thomas Anderson) and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor (given to both Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman) at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. However, the festival's jury originally intended to give the film the top Golden Lion prize for Best Film; the prize was removed and awarded to Pietà instead, owing to a new rule that prohibited the award of acting and directing honors to the same film that won the Golden Lion prize. A similar incident was rumored to have occurred at the festival in 2008, when Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler was to be awarded both the Golden Lion and the Volpi Cup for Mickey Rourke's performance. The film received the former, with the latter being awarded to Silvio Orlando for his work in Giovanna's Father. When asked about the last-minute shake-up over the award, Anderson replied, \"I'm thrilled with whatever they want to hand over. I heard some of the scuttlebutt recently, but I'm just thrilled with what they hand over. And that's all.\"[84][85][86][87] |  | The Master was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[88]","m_production":"It was first reported in December 2009 that Anderson had been working on a script about the founder of a new religious organization (described as being similar to Scientology) played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.[3][4] An associate of Anderson stated that the idea for the film had been in Anderson's head for about twelve years.[5] The idea for the film came to him after reading a quote that periods after wars were productive times for spiritual movements to start.[6] | Unsure of the direction the script would take, Anderson began writing The Master as a collection of disparate scenes rather than one coherent outline.[6] He combined unused scenes from early drafts of There Will Be Blood, the life stories of John Steinbeck and L. Ron Hubbard, and stories Jason Robards had told him on the set of Magnolia about his drinking days in the navy during the war (including the draining of ethanol from a torpedo).[6] Anderson conducted research about Dianetics and its early followers.[7] While writing, Anderson consulted Hoffman's feedback on the script, and Hoffman suggested that the film focus more on Freddie's story than Lancaster's.[6] | After the film was dropped by Universal and failed to pick up a distributor, Anderson did several months of rewrites.[8] | Anderson has stated that he wanted Hoffman to play Lancaster Dodd from the film's inception, and that he also had Joaquin Phoenix in mind for the part of Freddie Quell.[6] Jeremy Renner and James Franco were each rumored to play Freddie before Phoenix was officially attached.[1][9][10] This was Phoenix's first screen appearance since the 2010 film I'm Still Here, a multi-year performance art mockumentary project that Phoenix attributed as a factor in limiting the roles he was subsequently offered.[11][12] Reese Witherspoon was reportedly offered the role of Peggy Dodd, but Amy Adams was later cast.[13][14] For the role of Dodd's daughter Amanda Seyfried, Emma Stone, and Deborah Ann Woll were all considered with the role eventually going to Ambyr Childers.[15] | Filming was to begin in August 2010 with Renner starring opposite Hoffman, but was postponed indefinitely in September 2010.[16][17] In May 2011, after securing finance, the film was given the green light and filming began in early June 2011 in Vallejo and Sacramento.[1][18][19] Shooting took place on Mare Island for a month using the wing of an old hospital and an empty admiral's mansion for some scenes.[5] Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidential yacht, the USS Potomac, was used for shooting shipboard scenes.[20] In late June 2011 filming took place at Hillside Elementary School in Berkeley.[21] | The film was shot on 65 mm film[22] using the Panavision System 65 camera.[23] The film was the first fiction film to be shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet in 1996.[24] Mihai Mălaimare Jr. served as cinematographer, making The Master Anderson's first film without cinematographer Robert Elswit.[25] The film crew used three 65mm Panavision cameras throughout filming, and at times had an assistant from Panavision on set to help with the cameras' technical issues.[26] Originally, Anderson and Mălaimare planned to shoot mainly portraits in 65mm, which constituted 20 percent of the film, but ultimately 85 percent of the film was shot in 65mm.[23] The remainder of the film was shot on 35mm using Panavision Millennium XL2s cameras, often used for scenes that required a \"dirtier\" look.[23] In order to maintain a consistent aspect ratio, the 65mm footage was cropped from 2.20:1 to 1.85:1 to match the 35mm footage, at the sacrifice of some image area.[23] Most of the film stocks used were KODAK VISION3 50D Color Negative Film 5203 and KODAK VISION3 200T Color Negative Film 5213 with a few scenes were also done with KODAK VISION3 250D Color Negative Film 5207 and KODAK VISION3 500T 5219.[23] Because Anderson prefers working with film, he bypassed the use of a digital intermediate, instead color grading with the use of a photochemical timer.[26] | During filming, Phoenix was allowed to improvise on set.[11] Phoenix lost significant weight for the role and came up with Freddie's awkward gait.[11] Anderson compared Phoenix's commitment to that of Daniel Day-Lewis for his level of concentration, saying that Phoenix got into character and stayed there for three months.[6][12] Anderson considered the dynamic between Hoffman and Phoenix to be central to the film, likening it to the rivalry and differences in style and temperament between tennis players John McEnroe and Björn Borg or Ivan Lendl, with Hoffman playing the more controlled and driven approach of Borg or Lendl.[27] Adams stated that Anderson would have her appear on set for scenes she was not scheduled to appear in to make her presence felt and at times she didn't know whether the camera was on her.[28] | Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead composed the score for the film.[35][36] This is the second time Greenwood scored an Anderson film, the first being There Will Be Blood, released in December 2007.[35] | The official soundtrack was released through Nonesuch Records, and comprises eleven compositions by Greenwood along with four recordings from the film's era. Performers include the London Contemporary Orchestra and Ella Fitzgerald, among others.[37] The track \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me)\" is presented as performed in the film by actress Madisen Beaty. | The Weinstein Company also released a more comprehensive score on their website as part of the film's promotion, featuring alternate versions of the tracks.[38] | All music composed by Jonny Greenwood except as noted below.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Paul Thomas Anderson","m_produced_by":"JoAnne Sellar Daniel Lupi Paul Thomas Anderson Megan Ellison","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Joaquin Phoenix Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams","m_music_by":"Jonny Greenwood","m_cinematography":"Mihai Mălaimare Jr.","m_edited_by":"Leslie Jones Peter McNulty","m_production_company":"JoAnne Sellar Productions Ghoulardi Film Company Annapurna Pictures","m_distributed_by":"The Weinstein Company","m_release_dates":"September 1, 2012 (2012-09-01) (VFF) | September 14, 2012 (2012-09-14) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"137 minutes","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$32 million[1]","m_box_office":"$28.3 million[2] | The Master is a 2012 American noir drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Paul Thomas Anderson and starring Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. It tells the story of Freddie Quell (Phoenix), a World War II veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society, who meets Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), a leader of a religious movement known as \"The Cause\". Dodd sees something in Quell and accepts him into the movement. Freddie takes a liking to \"The Cause\" and begins traveling with Dodd along the East Coast to spread the teachings. | It was produced by Annapurna Pictures and Ghoulardi Film Company and distributed by The Weinstein Company. With a budget of $30 million, filming began in June 2011, with cinematography provided by Mihai Mălaimare Jr. Jonny Greenwood composed, and Leslie Jones and Peter McNulty edited. The film was partly inspired by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, as well as early drafts of There Will Be Blood, drunk Navy stories that Jason Robards had told to Anderson prior, and the life story of John Steinbeck. The Master was shot almost entirely on 65mm film stock, making it the first fiction feature to be shot and released in 70 since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet in 1996. | Initially, the film was set up with Universal, but fell through due to script and budget problems. It was first publicly shown on August 3, 2012, at the American Cinematheque in 70 mm and screened variously in the same way, and officially premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 1. where it won the FIPRESCI Award for Best Film. It was released on September 14, 2012, in the United States to critical acclaim, with its acting, screenplay, direction, plausibility and realistic resemblance to post-WWII Americans praised. It further received three Academy Award nominations: Best Actor for Phoenix, Best Supporting Actor for Hoffman, and Best Supporting Actress for Adams. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c d Fleming, Mike (May 9, 2011). \"Harvey Weinstein Buys World Rights To Paul Thomas Anderson's Untitled Next Film\".
