It was the third installment in the TV series about adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. A potent streak of humour ran through the film as concerns references to traditional British customs and stereotypes, ensuring the film's popularity with several generations of Russophone viewers. Other features of this best entry in the series include excellent exterior shots which closely match the novel's setting in the Dartmoor marshland, as well as an all-star cast: in addition to the famous Livanov -Solomin duo as Holmes and Watson, the film stars the internationally acclaimed actor/director Nikita Mikhalkov as Sir Henry Baskerville and the Russian movie legend Oleg Yankovsky as Jack Stapleton.[1]","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Приключения Шерлока Холмса и доктора Ватсона: Собака Баскервилей (ТВ)","m_external_link":"The Hound of the Baskervilles at the Internet Movie Database | The Hound of the Baskervilles at AllMovie | A page dedicated to the series","m_poster":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Sobaka_dvd.jpg/220px-Sobaka_dvd.jpg","m_production_companies":null,"m_written_by":null}
