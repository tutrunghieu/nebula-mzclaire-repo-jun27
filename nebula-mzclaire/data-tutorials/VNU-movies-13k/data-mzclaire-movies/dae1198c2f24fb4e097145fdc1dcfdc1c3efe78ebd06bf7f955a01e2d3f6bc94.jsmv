{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In London in the year 1907, a British aristocrat named Sir Anthony Ross (Donald Sinden) hastily arranges an expedition to the Arctic to search for his lost son Donald. Donald had become lost on a whaling expedition to find the fabled island where whales go to die. | Sir Anthony employs the talents of a Scandinavian-American archaeologist Professor John Ivarsson (David Hartman) and Captain Brieux (Jacques Marin), a French inventor/aeronaut who pilots the expedition in a French dirigible named the Hyperion, which Captain Brieux invented. Upon reaching the Arctic, they meet Oomiak (Mako Iwamatsu), a comically cowardly/brave Eskimo friend of Donald's, and trick him into helping them join in the search. | Ultimately, the expedition becomes (temporarily) separated from Captain Brieux, and discovers an uncharted island named Astragard, occupied by a lost civilization of Vikings, cut off from the rest of the world for centuries. The Vikings capture Sir Anthony and Ivarsson, but Oomiak escapes. Shortly thereafter they find Donald, but are nearly put to death by the fanatic Godi (pronounced \"Go-dah\"), a sort-of Lawspeaker/Soothsayer authority figure. | The three men (Sir Anthony, Ivarsson and Donald) are saved from being burned alive by a brave and beautiful Viking girl named Freyja, with whom Donald is deeply and mutually in love. They escape, and are rejoined by Oomiak and eventually find the Whales Graveyard, but are attacked by Killer Whales. Here they are saved by the sudden reappearance of Captain Brieux, but they are still being pursued by the angry Godi and his rather unwilling warriors. | Finally, Godi is killed by the explosion when he shoots a fiery arrow at the Hyperion, but the Vikings will not let the expedition return to their world unless one of them remains behind as a hostage. Ivarsson however, willingly volunteers to stay, because this is a chance to live history. Ivarsson also points out that if someday Mankind is ever foolish enough to destroy itself, places like Astragard may become humanity's final refuge. | Sir Anthony, Donald, Freyja, Captain Brieux and Oomiak, are allowed to depart in peace, promising not to tell the Outside World about Astragard. As Ivarsson heads back to Astragard, he turns to look back just in time to see his four friends move further and further away until they vanish into the Arctic mist.","m_cast":"Donald Sinden - Sir Anthony Ross | David Hartman - Prof. Ivarsson | Jacques Marin - Captain Brieux | Mako - Oomiak | David Gwillim - Donald Ross | Agneta Eckemyr - Freyja | Gunnar Öhlund - The Godi (as Gunnar Ohlund) | Lasse Kolstad - Erik | Erik Silju - Torvald | Rolf Søder - The Lawspeaker | Torsten Wahlund - Sven | Sverre Anker Ousdal - Gunnar (as Sverre Ousdal) | Niels Hinrichsen - Sigurd | Denny Miller - Town Guard | Brendan Dillon - The Factor","m_reception":"Despite the lukewarm reception upon its first release, it has been given better reviews in later years.[citation needed]","m_production":"The film was based on the novel The Lost Ones, written by Ian Cameron, set in the location of Prince Patrick Island. To tie in with the film, the novel was reissued with the movie's title. There were several changes from the book to the film. The novel is set in 1960, but the film is set in 1907. Instead of Prince Patrick Island, the island in the film is located due north of Ellesmere Island (cf. Crocker Land). Several extra characters and the airship Hyperion appear in the film, but not in the novel. Also, the greatest departure in the film is Freyja survives to (presumably) live happily ever after with Donald, whereas in the book she tragically dies, sacrificing herself to save Donald and Sir Anthony.","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Robert Stevenson","m_produced_by":"Winston Hibler","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Donald Sinden David Hartman Jacques Marin Mako Agneta Eckemyr","m_music_by":"Maurice Jarre","m_cinematography":"Frank V.
