{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In an orphanage, a little girl named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is awake at 3:00 in the morning. When she looks out the window, she sees a giant. The giant (Mark Rylance) takes her into Giant Country. Sophie attempts to escape, but the giant catches her. She asks why he took her. The giant says that she saw him and didn't want her to spread the word. The giant introduces himself as the Big Friendly Giant (or BFG for short). Later, the BFG reads a book and Sophie falls asleep. The BFG gives her a dream. | Her dream was about her escaping, but gets eaten by a bigger giant. She wakes up and knows that the BFG gave her that nightmare. The BFG says that it wouldn't be safe for her if she tries to escape. Just then a bigger, meaner giant named The Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement), comes in the BFG's house. Sophie hides in a giant vegetable. Bloodbottler was about to eat it, but the BFG reminds him that he doesn't like vegetables. So the bigger giant refuses to eat it and leaves. | Sophie comes out of her hiding place and the BFG tells her a secret. He catches dreams. The BFG puts Sophie inside a tree house and starts working on his dreams. Sophie eventually convinces the BFG to take her to the top of the hill. But first, they must pass the nine other giants that are asleep. | The giants Fleshlumpeater, Bloodbottler, Bonecruncher, Gizzardgulper, Manhugger, Childchewer, Meatdripper, Maidmasher and Butcher Boy are woken up by them. Fortunately, Sophie hides in a torn up car they use for \"their game.\" They decide to bully the BFG and play \"their game.\" The BFG rides one car down a hill whilst the larger giant rides the other car, with Sophie within, down the other hill. Sophie steers the car clear of the BFG and the pair escape. Sophie tells the BFG that he shouldn't allow the other giants to bully him. Meanwhile, the other giants find Sophie's blanket and set out to look for her. | The BFG tells Sophie that he can hear whispers, when a dream passes, but the BFG does not catch it. Instead, Sophie does, making it her dream. The two then come upon a pond and jump into it, taking them to the world of dreams. There, Sophie finds a very bad nightmare, which the BFG catches to take back to his house. | As the BFG gives dreams to sleeping children, Sophie realises that she has lost her blanket. The BFG realises that the other giants know about her, so he takes Sophie back to the orphanage, but Sophie instead convinces him to allow her to stay. They return to the BFG's home,only to find the other nine giants had broken in and destroyed most of the BFG's dreams. | Sophie devises a plan to give the Queen of the United Kingdom (Penelope Wilton) the nightmare they found earlier, enabling the monarch to see the giants kidnapping innocent children. Upon waking from her nightmare, the BFG and Sophie inform the Queen that the giants in her dream are indeed real and must be stopped at all costs before they cause any more harm to her subjects. The Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country, who capture the giants and drop them off by helicopter on a remote island far away from civilization with the help of Sophie and the BFG. | In the aftermath, Sophie is seen living in the Queen's palace. Subtly hinted she's been adopted by Mary and possibly Mr. Tibbs; whom are hinted to be a couple. The BFG stays in Giant Country and is living peacefully while growing a wide variety of vegetables and still deliver dreams to which he was introduced during his visit with the Queen. The film ends with Sophie whispering \"Good Morning\" to BFG which he happily hears his friend.","m_cast":"Mark Rylance as The BFG, a friendly, big-hearted, 24 foot tall elderly runt giant whose name is short for the \"Big Friendly Giant\".[8] | Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, an orphan who befriends the BFG.[9] Lucia Ryan was the understudy for Sophie. | Penelope Wilton as The Queen[10] | Jemaine Clement as The Fleshlumpeater, a 50 ft. giant who is the de facto leader of the man-eating giants.[10] | Rebecca Hall as Mary, The Queen's maid.[10] | Rafe Spall as Mr. Tibbs, The Queen's butler.[11] | Bill Hader as The Bloodbottler, a 50 ft. giant who is the second-in-command to The Fleshlumpeater.[12] | Michael David Adamthwaite as The Butcher Boy[10] | Daniel Bacon as The Bonecruncher[10] | Chris Gibbs as The Gizzardgulper[10] | Adam Godley as The Manhugger[10] Godley also plays one of the rowdy bar patrons that Sophie scolds at the beginning of the film. | Jonathan Holmes as The Childchewer[10] | Paul Moniz de Sa as The Meatdripper[10] | Ólafur Ólafsson as The Maidmasher[10] | Chris Sands as General #1 | Matt Frewer as General #2 | Geoffrey Wade as General #3","m_reception":"As of July 3, 2016[update], The BFG has grossed $19.6 million in North America and $3.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $23.5 million, against a budget of $140 million.[3] | In the United States and Canada, The BFG opens alongside The Legend of Tarzan and The Purge: Election Year in over 3,200 theaters, with opening projections starting at $22 million and going as high as $32 million.[40][41] The film was notably vying for drawing family audiences with the studio's own Finding Dory.[2] It made $775,000 from its Thursday previews, however the low figure wasn't surprising, given how family films tend to attract less audiences during late-night showings.[42][43] This was followed by a $7 million opening day (including previews) and a dissapointing $19.6 million opening weekend, which Deadline.com called \"an awful start for this film which is estimated to cost $140 million\".[44][45] Forbes noted that Steven Spielberg's films tends to have long runs, irrespective of their opening numbers. However, it also pointed out that the July 4th weekend proves to be a non-leggy release schedule and most films released during this time end up making only twice their holiday total over the course of their domestic theatrical run.[46] | Internationally, where the 4th of July weekend is not a holiday, the film opened to $3.9 million in its opening weekend from two markets, Australia and Russia.[47] In Australia, it opened to $2 million placing third while in Russia it debuted second with $1.9 million, which tops the entire runs of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and War Horse. The next major openings are in Brazil on July 28 and Korea on August 4.[47] | The BFG received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 71%, based on 168 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The BFG minimizes the darker elements of Roald Dahl's classic in favor of a resolutely good-natured, visually stunning, and largely successful family-friendly adventure\".[48] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 43 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[7] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.[49]","m_production":"Producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy began development on a live-action adaptation of The BFG in 1991, and set the project up at Paramount Pictures.[13] Husband and wife screenwriters Robin Swicord and Nicholas Kazan wrote a screenplay adaptation in 1998, with Robin Williams in mind for the title role.[14][15][16] By 2001, the script had been rewritten by Gwyn Lurie, and was greeted with positive feedback from the Dahl estate.[17] | In September 2011, DreamWorks announced that they had picked up the film rights to the book; Kennedy and Marshall were slated to produce, with screenwriter Melissa Mathison adapting the story.[18] Initially, John Madden was in negotiations to direct, however, in April 2014, Steven Spielberg was announced as the director, with Madden now listed as executive producer with producer Michael Siegel.[19] Kennedy had initially thought of Spielberg as director, but hesitated asking him until a more concrete screenplay was presentable.[20] Walden Media agreed to co-produce and co-finance the film with DreamWorks and Amblin in March 2015.[21] A month later, Walt Disney Studios—which was under prior agreement to distribute the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner—also joined the production as a co-producer and co-financier, and shifted the film from a Touchstone release to a Walt Disney Pictures production instead.[22] Consequently, The BFG is the first Disney-branded film directed by Spielberg, though he has previously produced several films for the studio.[23][24] Additionally, DreamWorks did not receive a marquee credit—placement of the studio's production logo on marketing materials, nor in the film's opening titles, and instead is represented by Amblin, although DreamWorks still serves as a copyright holder for the film.[25] The film is the second adaptation of the novel following the 1989 direct-to-television animated film. | On October 27, 2014, Mark Rylance was cast in the film's title role.[8] Spielberg was quoted as saying that \"Mark Rylance is a transformational actor. I am excited and thrilled that Mark will be making this journey with us to Giant Country. Everything about his career so far is about making the courageous choice and I'm honoured he has chosen The BFG as his next big screen performance.\"[26][27] Rylance performed the character through motion capture, a process which he referred to as \"liberating\".[28] In mid-November 2014, it was revealed that a ten-year-old student of Lower Peover School, Ruby Barnhill, had auditioned for the film. She had to learn six pages of dialogue in preparation for a possible role as the orphan Sophie.[29] After a lengthy search, on December 16, Barnhill was cast in the role, about which she said, \"I feel incredibly lucky and I'm so happy.\" Spielberg stated that they \"have discovered a wonderful Sophie in Ruby Barnhill.\"[9] Bill Hader was set to star in the film in an unspecified role on March 27, 2015.[12] On April 13, 2015, the rest of the cast was announced, which included Penelope Wilton, Rebecca Hall, Jemaine Clement, Michael David Adamthwaite, Daniel Bacon, Chris Gibbs, Adam Godley, Jonathan Holmes, Paul Moniz de Sa, and Ólafur Ólafsson.[10] | Principal photography on the film began on March 23, 2015 in Vancouver[10][30] and concluded on June 12, 2015.[31] Weta Digital worked on the film's visual effects.[32]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The BFG  by Roald Dahl","m_directed_by":"Steven Spielberg","m_produced_by":"Steven Spielberg | Frank Marshall | Sam Mercer","m_screenplay_by":"Melissa Mathison","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Mark Rylance | Ruby Barnhill | Penelope Wilton | Jemaine Clement | Rebecca Hall | Rafe Spall | Bill Hader","m_music_by":"John Williams","m_cinematography":"Janusz Kamiński","m_edited_by":"Michael Kahn","m_production_company":null,"m_distributed_by":"Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures","m_release_dates":"May 14, 2016 (2016-05-14) (Cannes) | July 1, 2016 (2016-07-01) (United States) |  |  | ","m_running_time":"117 minutes[1]","m_country":"United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$140 million[2]","m_box_office":"$23.5 million[3] | The BFG is a 2016 American fantasy adventure film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison, based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl.

In the film, an orphan human girl befriends a benevolent giant, dubbed the \"Big Friendly Giant\", who takes her to Giant Country, where they attempt to stop man-eating giants that are invading the human world. | Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall began development on an adaptation of The BFG in the 1990s, and various screenwriters were hired to work on the screenplay in the subsequent years. DreamWorks acquired the screen rights to Dahl's book in September 2011, and Marshall and Sam Mercer joined as producers, Mathison as screenwriter, and Kennedy as executive producer. Spielberg was announced as director in April 2014, alongside his production company Amblin Entertainment as co-producer. Principal photography commenced in March 2015, marking Spielberg's first directorial film for Walt Disney Pictures.[4] | The BFG premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2016 and held its North American debut at the El Capitan Theater on June 21, 2016.[5] The film was released in the United States in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D, IMAX 3D,[6] and conventional theatrical formats on July 1, 2016.
