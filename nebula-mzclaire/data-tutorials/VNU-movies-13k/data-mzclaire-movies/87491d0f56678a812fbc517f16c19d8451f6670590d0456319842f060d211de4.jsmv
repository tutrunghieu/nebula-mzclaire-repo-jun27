He began by seeking out Pepito Alvarez to inquire about Sofia, an infant abandoned by Reavis many years before. | Reavis decides to take Sofia home with him, hire governess Lorna Morales to refine her, then marry her, using fabricated proof that identifies Sofia as the rightful \"baroness\" of Arizona. A suspicious U.S. government, unable to disprove Reavis' claim, offers him $25 million for the rights to the land. He declines. | The surveyor general, Miller, is sure Reavis has somehow doctored the documents. He brings in Griff, an expert on forgery. In the meantime, Reavis orders settlers and families off \"his\" land. A displaced rancher, Lansing, tosses a bomb into Reavis' office. It still does not discourage him, so Pepito finally threatens to reveal that Sofia's parents were not Spanish land barons at all, but native Indians. | Reavis is revealed as a charlatan. He manages to talk his way out of a lynching, but ends up behind bars.","m_cast":"Vincent Price as James Reavis | Ellen Drew as Sofia | Vladimir Sokoloff as Pepito | Beulah Bondi as Lorna | Reed Hadley as Griff | Robert Barrat as the Judge | Robin Short as Tom Lansing | Karen Kester as Young Sofia | Margia Dean as the Marquesa | Jonathan Hale as the Governor | Edward Keane as Miller | Barbara Woodell as Mrs. Lansing | I.
