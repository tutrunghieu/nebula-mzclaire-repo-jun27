Feldman plays Digby Geste, the awkward and clumsy \"identical twin\" brother of Michael York's Beau, the dignified, aristocratic swashbuckler. |  | ","m_budget":null,"m_box_office":null,"m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ Barnes, Mike (2015-01-12). \"Bernard Williams, Producer on 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Ragtime,' Dies at 72\".
