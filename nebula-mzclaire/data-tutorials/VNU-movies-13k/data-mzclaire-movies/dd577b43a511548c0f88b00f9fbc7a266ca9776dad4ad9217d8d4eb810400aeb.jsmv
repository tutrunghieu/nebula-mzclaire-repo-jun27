{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Junior Jackson (Jerry Lewis) is the nerdy son of a former All-American football hero, Jarring Jack Jackson (Eddie Mayehoff). His mother (Ruth Hussey) is another former star athlete, having been a champion Olympic swimmer. Junior is something of a disappointment to his father, who has a difficult time understanding how two athletes could produce such a weakling. | Junior is more interested in animal husbandry than sports, but his father has other plans. In exchange for free tuition to college, Bill Baker (Dean Martin) makes a deal with Jarring Jack to turn his son into a football star. | Junior somehow makes the team, in addition to falling for beautiful co-ed Terry Howard (Marion Marshall). He is too shy to talk to her, however, so she winds up falling for Bill. Some misadventures follow, including Junior scoring a touchdownâ€”for the opposite team. | To keep up the ruse (and free education), Bill and Terry continue to support Junior and build his new-found confidence. Junior confides to Bill that he intends to marry Terry, so a guilt-ridden Bill gets drunk and makes a scene at Terry's dorm. As a result, he is expelled. | Junior, finding out the truth about Bill and Terry, is determined to make things right. He goes on to win the big game single-handedly and lives up to his father's expectations, who proudly exclaims, \"That's my boy!\"","m_cast":"Dean Martin as Bill Baker | Jerry Lewis as Junior Jackson | Ruth Hussey as Ann Jackson | Eddie Mayehoff as Jarring Jack Jackson | Marion Marshall as Terry Howard | Polly Bergen as Betty \"Babs\" Hunter | Hugh Sanders as Coach Wheeler | John McIntire as Dr. Benjamin Green | Francis Pierlot as Henry Baker | Lillian Randolph as May the Maid | Selmer Jackson as Doc Hunter (as Selmar Jackson) | Tom Harmon as Himself | Gregg Palmer as Student (as Palmer Lee) | Hazel Boyne as Housemother (billed as Hazel \"Sonny\" Boyne)","m_reception":null,"m_production":"That's My Boy was filmed from December 6, 1950 through January 10, 1951.
