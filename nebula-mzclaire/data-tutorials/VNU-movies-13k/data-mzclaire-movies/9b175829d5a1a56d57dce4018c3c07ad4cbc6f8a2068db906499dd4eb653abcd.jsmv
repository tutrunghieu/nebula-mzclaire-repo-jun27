{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In Japanese society, it is said a curse is created when a person dies in the grip of a powerful rage or sorrow. Those who encounter the evil supernatural force are consumed by it, the curse is born repeatedly and spreads. The original victims of the curse, the Saeki family, haunt their Tokyo suburban house as ghosts and kill anyone who enters. Housewife Kayako Saeki was murdered by her husband Takeo after he discovered she loved another man, their son Toshio and pet cat Mar also being murdered, before Takeo was hanged by Kayako’s ghost. In the first film, American social worker Karen Davis tried to burn the house down to stop the curse, but failed, finding herself hospitalised and haunted by Kayako. The film’s chronology is told in a non-linear fashion, taking place in 2004 and 2006 respectively. | Karen’s younger sister Aubrey is summoned by their bed-ridden mother who informs Aubrey of Karen’s situation and sends her to Tokyo to retrieve her. In Japan, Aubrey struggles to communicate with the hospital staff but a journalist named Eason aids her. Aubrey briefly speaks with Karen, who quickly panics, and has to be restrained. Karen later escapes her restraints and flees through the hospital stalked by Kayako, until she makes it to the roof which Kayako throws her off in front of Aubrey and Eason. Eason explains the curse to Aubrey, revealing he rescued Karen from the house fire, and has been investigating the Saeki murders and surrounding events. The two go to the house to retrieve Kayako’s diary, but Toshio drags Aubrey inside to curse her. | Eason takes the diary to an associate, who explains Kayako’s mother Mrs. Kawamata was an itako who exorcised evil spirits from visitors and fed them to her daughter. Aubrey and Eason plan to visit Mrs. Kawamata the next day, but at night, Eason develops photographs he took of the Saeki house, but Kayako emerges from a photo and murders him. Aubrey discovers his body in the morning and travels alone to Mrs. Kawamata’s remote rural home. Kayako’s mother warns her the curse is irreversible, and is suddenly killed by her daughter. Aubrey ventures to the house, following an image of Karen inside but encounters Takeo’s ghost who plays out the night he discovered his wife’s disloyalty, and snaps Aubrey’s neck. | Two years later, school girls Allison Flemming, Vanessa, and Miyuki, break into the house on a dare but Allison is locked in the closet and encounters Aubrey’s ghost but the girls escape. After Miyuki and Vanessa are consumed by the curse, Allison speaks with school counsellor Ms. Dale about the curse, but Dale denies its existence, revealing she went to the house and is actually a ghost herself. Allison is haunted by the ghosts of her friends, and she eventually flees back to Chicago, where she stays with her parents. | Several months on, the Kimbles move into an apartment block in Chicago. The young son Jake is disturbed by a strange presence in the building brought about by a hooded stranger who covers windows with newspaper. Jake’s father Bill and stepmother Trish are influenced by the curse, Bill accusing his wife of having an affair but she bludgeons him with a frying pan. Jake and his sister Lacey return from school, but Jake finds his family are all dead. He runs into the hooded person, revealed to be Allison, who explains the curse followed her. Kayako appears in Allison’s hood, finally taking her, and then emerges to attack Jake.","m_cast":"Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen Davis, the sole, traumatized survivor of The Grudge. | Amber Tamblyn as Aubrey Davis, Karen's little sister | Arielle Kebbel as Allison Fleming, a shy and emotional exchange student. | Edison Chen as Eason, a journalist who is investigating the Saeki murders | Teresa Palmer as Vanessa Cassidy, the popular bully of Japan International High School | Misako Uno as Miyuki Nazawa, Vanessa's best friend | Sarah Roemer as Lacey Kimble, a cheerleader and Jake's kind and supporting older sister | Jennifer Beals as Trish Kimble, Bill's new wife | Matthew Knight as Jake Kimble, a young boy who suspects something happening in their apartment | Christopher Cousins as Bill Kimble, Jake and Lacey's father | Jenna Dewan as Sally Johnson, Lacey's neighbor and best friend | Takako Fuji as Kayako Saeki Kyoka Takizawa as Young Kayako | Eve Gordon as Ms. Dale, Japan International High School's counselor | Ohga Tanaka and Yuya Ozeki as Toshio Saeki | Takashi Matsuyama as Takeo Saeki, Kayako's husband who becomes angry after seeing that she has feelings for another man | Joanna Cassidy as Mrs. Davis, Karen and Aubrey's sick mother | Shaun Sipos as Michael, Miyuki's boyfriend | Kim Miyori as Nakagawa Kawamata who is Kayako's mother | Paul Jarrett as John Fleming, Allison's father | Gwen Lorenzetti as Annie Fleming, Allison's mother","m_reception":null,"m_production":"The Grudge 2 was announced three days after the release of The Grudge in 2004[9] and was officially fasttracked[10][11] after a positive box office response with the film grossing $110,175,871.[12] In early January 2005 Takashi Shimizu suggested ideas regarding the film's plot. Ideas included the origin of the curse and new character subplots.[13] | The film was later placed into production hell for almost a year until December 2005, when the first few cast (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Teresa Palmer) members were announced. Other production details were also revealed, including the original scheduled date for principal photography, which was due to begin January 30, 2006, but was postponed until February.[14] Principal photography for The Grudge 2 was held at Toho Studios[15] in Tokyo, Japan and production wrapped up on April 25, 2006. During an interview on Dread Central with Amber Tamblyn, it was reported that sets were created in Chicago, Illinois[16] for Tamblyn to re-shoot several scenes.[17] | Director Takashi Shimizu said in an interview with Sci Fi Wire: \"For The Grudge 2, I was going for this mystery that was never there in The Grudge, and I think that's going to fulfill the audience. ... There's a secret about Kayako's childhood life, so that's part of the big mystery. And the other mystery is this grudge will never stop, and it's going to ... spread. And how is it going to get spread? That's another mystery.\"[18] | He also clarified that: \"The Grudge was a complete remake of Ju-on, meaning the storyline was very similar. Basically, it's the same. But Grudge 2 is actually different from Ju-on: The Grudge 2, and I don't think I would have accepted this job if it was going to be the same storyline. And because it was a different story, you know, my motivation was a bit higher, and I actually enjoy doing this.\"[18]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":null,"m_directed_by":"Takashi Shimizu","m_produced_by":"Roy Lee | Sam Raimi | Robert Tapert","m_screenplay_by":null,"m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Amber Tamblyn | Arielle Kebbel | Jennifer Beals | Edison Chen | Sarah Roemer | Sarah Michelle Gellar","m_music_by":"Christopher Young","m_cinematography":"Katsumi Yanagishima","m_edited_by":"Jeff Betancourt","m_production_company":"Ghost House Pictures","m_distributed_by":"Columbia Pictures (USA) Universal Pictures (UK) Roadshow Entertainment (AU/NZ)","m_release_dates":"October 13, 2006 (2006-10-13) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"102 minutes 108 minutes (unrated cut)","m_country":"United States Japan","m_language":"English | Japanese","m_budget":"$20 million[1]","m_box_office":"$70.7 million[1] | The Grudge 2 is a 2006 American supernatural horror film and a sequel to 2004's The Grudge, directed by Takashi Shimizu (director of the Ju-on series)[2] and written by Stephen Susco.[3] The film was produced by Sam Raimi and stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Amber Tamblyn, Edison Chen, Arielle Kebbel, Teresa Palmer, Misako Uno, Matthew Knight, and Takako Fuji.
