{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Set in England in 1872, the story concerned a prominent, knighted surgeon whose wife has fallen into a coma caused by a deep-seated brain tumor. Due to medicine's state of the art at the time, he does not know how to reach the tumor without risking brain damage or death to the woman he loves, so he undertakes to secretly experiment on the brains of living, but involuntary, human subjects who are under the influence of a powerful Indian anesthetic, Nind Andhera, which he calls the \"Black Sleep\". Once he has finished his experiment, surviving subjects are revived and placed, in seriously degenerated and mutilated states, in a hidden cellar in the gloomy, abandoned country abbey where he conducts his experiments.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"story by Gerald Drayson Adams","m_directed_by":"Reginald Le Borg","m_produced_by":"Howard W.
