{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1912, a teenage boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) from Devon, England, witnesses the birth of a Bay Thoroughbred foal and subsequently watches with admiration the growth of the young horse. Much to the dismay of his mother Rose (Emily Watson), his father Ted (Peter Mullan) buys the colt at auction, outbidding their landlord Lyons (David Thewlis), despite their needing a more suitable plough horse for the farm work. Albert's best friend, Andrew Easton (Matt Milne), watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands. He names the horse Joey. | Ted carries a war injury that causes him ongoing physical and mental pain. While he cannot speak of his time in the Cavalry, Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the Second Boer War that he earned for bravery under fire. She gives Albert his father's regimental pennant, telling Albert that his father felt shame over what he did during the war, and that he had thrown the flag and medals away, though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert does not understand why Ted would be ashamed of having fought in a war. | Against all odds and Lyons' hopes, Albert manages to train Joey and have him plough a rocky field, that Ted plants with turnips. However, a heavy downpour in 1914 destroys the turnip crop, so Ted is compelled to sell the horse to the army in order to pay his rent. Albert begs his father to return the money. Captain James Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) sees the boy's attachment and promises to look after the steed. Albert tries to enlist in the army but is too young, and before the captain leaves with Joey, Albert ties his father's pennant to Joey's bridle. | Joey is trained for military operations and becomes attached to Topthorn, a black horse with whom he is trained for his military role. The two horses are deployed to Flanders with a flying column under the command of Nicholls and Major Jamie Stewart (Benedict Cumberbatch), but they lead a cavalry charge through a German encampment, and the unit is mown down by machine gun fire. Nicholls is killed along with almost all his fellow cavalrymen; the Germans capture the horses. | A young German soldier called Gunther (David Kross) is assigned to the care of Joey and Topthorn, who are used to draw an ambulance wagon. When his 14-year-old brother Michael (Leonard Carow) is sent to the front line, Gunther takes the horses and the four of them desert, hiding inside a nearby farm. However, the boys are soon discovered and executed by firing squad. | An orphaned French girl named Emilie (Céline Buckens), who lives at the farm with her grandfather (Niels Arestrup), finds the two horses and takes care of them. German soldiers arrive and confiscate supplies from the property, even the jam that Emilie's grandfather makes, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. Emilie suffers from a disease that makes her bones fragile and is not allowed to ride the horses for fear of falling. Nonetheless, Emilie's Grandfather, for her birthday, allows her to ride Joey. She gallops the horse up the hill and runs into the Germans who then take the horses, breaking Emilie's heart. The grandfather keeps the pennant. | By 1918, Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the Second Battle of the Somme, under the command of Lyons's son David (Robert Emms). After a British charge into no-man's land, Albert and Andrew miraculously make it across into a deserted German trench, where a gas bomb explodes, filling the trench with poison gas. | Joey and Topthorn are used by the Germans to haul artillery up a large muddy hill, under the command of Private Friedrick Henglemann (Nicolas Bro), who tries to keep the horses alive. Topthorn eventually succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Friedrich is dragged away by other German soldiers, leaving Joey to face an oncoming Mark I tank. The horse escapes and runs into no-man's land, where he gets entangled in the barbed wire barriers. From their respective trenches, both British and German soldiers spot Joey in the night mist, and a British soldier named Colin (Toby Kebbell), waves a white flag and tries to free the horse. Peter (Hinnerk Schönemann), a German soldier, comes over with wire cutters, and together they free Joey from the wire. The two make friendly talk on the remorseless war. They flip a coin to decide who should take the horse; Colin wins and guides Joey back to the British trench, now having made friends with Peter. | Andrew is killed by the gas attack, but Albert survives, temporarily blinded. While recuperating, he hears about the \"miraculous horse\" rescued from no-man's land. The army doctor (Liam Cunningham) instructs Sgt. Fry (Eddie Marsan) to put Joey down. But when Fry is about to shoot, Joey hears the owl call he learnt as a colt. Albert is led through the troops to Joey, again sounding his call, and Joey hurries to meet his long-missed friend. Albert explains that he raised Joey, and with bandages still covering his eyes, gives an exact description of the horse's markings, confirming his claim. With Joey covered in mud, the camp doctor at first dismisses Albert's statement, but he is astonished when soldiers wash away the grime, revealing the four white socks and diamond star on Joey's forehead. | An order is made that the horse should be auctioned and Albert is given money collected from his fellow soldiers in order to bid for him, but bidding by a butcher exceeds that of the collection. Then a bid of £100 is entered. The bidder is an older gentleman, Emilie's grandfather, who informs the butcher that if he is bid against, he will sell his coat and bid to £110 – and should he bid against him again, he will sell his farm and bid to £1,000. No other bid is placed, and the grandfather takes ownership of Joey, planning to return with him to his farm. He tells Albert that Emilie has died, and after hearing about the miracle horse, he travelled for three days to get Joey back, for the sake of his beloved granddaughter's memory. | Albert pleads for the horse with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains unmoved. The old man is surprised, however, when the horse chooses to return to Albert, and he presents Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is. Albert's quick recognition of the pennant convinces the grandfather that Joey is indeed his horse. He gives Joey back to Albert, saying that it's what Emilie would have wanted. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, where he returns the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends his hand to the boy, now a man and like him, a former soldier.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":"Based on 203 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, War Horse received a 77% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating from critics with an average score of 7/10. The site's critical consensus is \"Technically superb, proudly sentimental, and unabashedly old-fashioned, War Horse is an emotional drama that tugs the heartstrings with Spielberg's customary flair.\"[6] | Although there was an embargo on official reviews of the film being published before 21 December 2011,[136] reviews started appearing from 26 November 2011 onwards in mainstream press such as The Daily Telegraph, which gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars.[137] | Giving the film an A- grade, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"The project is tailor-made for Saving Private Ryan Spielberg, the war-story specialist, as well as for E.T. Spielberg, the chronicler of boyhood desires and yearnings for family.\"[138] Christopher Tookey of Daily Mail gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and called it \"Spielberg's finest hour\".[139] Rex Reed of The New York Observer gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and said, \"War Horse is a don't-miss Spielberg classic that reaches true perfection. It's as good as movies can get, and one of the greatest triumphs of this or any other year.\"[140] | Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying the film contained \"surely some of the best footage Spielberg has ever directed\". He wrote, \"The film is made with superb artistry. Spielberg is the master of an awesome canvas. Most people will enjoy it, as I did.\" [141] Richard Roeper praised War Horse by saying, \"What a gorgeous, breathtaking, epic adventure this is.\" He gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars.[142] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said that the film was a work of full-throated Hollywood classicism that looks back to the craftsmanship and sentimentality of John Ford and other legends of the studio era. He gave it 3 out of 4 stars.[143] | The film also made many critics' top film lists of 2011. Richard Corliss of Time named it 2011's fifth best film, saying \"Boldly emotional, nakedly heartfelt, War Horse will leave only the stoniest hearts untouched\".[144] David Chen of /Film selected War Horse as 2011's best film.[145] | In The Guardian, Simon Winder lamented that the film, \"despite twisting and turning to be even-handed, simply could not help itself and, like some faux-reformed alcoholic, gorged itself on an entire miniature liqueur selection of Anglo-German clichés\".[146] David Denby of The New Yorker wrote about the film that \"The horses themselves are magnificent, and maybe that's reason enough to see the movie. But War Horse is a bland, bizarrely unimaginative piece of work\".[147] | The soundtrack recording by John Williams received a Sammy Award for Best New Film Score CD.[148] | War Horse grossed $79,859,441 domestically and $97,200,000 overseas, for a worldwide total of $177 million (approx).[2]","m_production":"Spielberg films are renowned for the levels of secrecy and security during filming, and this was no exception: filming took place under the codename Dartmoor.[50][55] The filming period took 'about 64 days' in total.[56] | Filming of War Horse began with the cavalry scenes being filmed at Stratfield Saye House in north Hampshire, the estate of the Duke of Wellington, where incidentally Wellington's war horse Copenhagen is buried. Here a cavalry charge involving 130 extras was filmed.[14][57] | Filming on location on Dartmoor, Devon started in August 2010.[58][59] Initially, Spielberg was only going to have four or five days' worth of second unit material shot in Devon, but after Kathleen Kennedy sent him photographs of the various locations she had scouted, he decided to cut other elements of the story to enable more filming to take place in countryside that Kennedy described as \"so extraordinarily beautiful and absolutely perfect for the story\".[60] Dartmoor locations included the small villages of Meavy and Sheepstor, Burrator Reservoir, Bonehill Rocks and surrounding area near Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Ringmoor Down, Combestone Tor and surrounding area, Haytor, Hexworthy Bridge and Cadover Bridge/Brisworthy.[61][62] Ditsworthy Warren House, an isolated Grade II listed building near Sheepstor on Dartmoor served as the Narracott family's farmhouse, and many scenes were filmed in the surrounding area.[61][63][64] | On 11 September 2010, the annual Dartmoor Yomp was re-routed to allow filming to continue undisturbed.[65] Spielberg praised the Dartmoor countryside's beauty: \"I have never before, in my long and eclectic career, been gifted with such an abundance of natural beauty as I experienced filming War Horse on Dartmoor... And, with two-and-a-half weeks of extensive coverage of landscapes and skies, I hardly scratched the surface of the visual opportunities that were offered to me.\"[66] Spielberg felt that the landscape was very much a character in the film.[67] | Although Devon rural locations were used, scenes in the main village in the story were filmed at the Wiltshire village of Castle Combe near Chippenham, despite the vernacular architecture of Devon (predominantly cob walls and thatched roofs) being very different from that of Wiltshire (stone walls and stone tiled roofs). Filming began there on 21 September 2010 and continued until 1 October 2010.[68][69][70][71] Some residents of Castle Combe were angered by the imposition of tightened security within the village, claiming they could not enter the village without waiting at perimeter barriers until breaks in filming.[72] | After Castle Combe, the production moved on to Wisley Airfield in Surrey, where no man's land battlefield scenes were filmed.[31][55][73][74] Shooting of wartime camp scenes also took place for about two weeks from 4 October 2010 at Bourne Wood near Farnham in Surrey, a frequent location for filming.[55][75][76][77] On 13–14 October 2010, scenes were shot at the stately home Luton Hoo.[78] Filming was also scheduled to be undertaken at Caerwent in Wales.[79] Studio filming was undertaken at Longcross Studios, Chertsey in Surrey[76] and at Twickenham Film Studios.[80] The film shoot was completed in the last week of October 2010,[33][81] with the entire film, French scenes included, being shot in the U.K.,[10] apart from some pick-up shots of a bay foal filmed in March 2011 in California. | \"The Michael Morpurgo book is ‘Black Beauty goes to war’. So if you’re English, two of the most emotive subjects you could touch on are Black Beauty and the First World War. The crew were constantly in tears, as there were war memorials and everybody had a story in their family ... for English people, everyone is touched by that war.\" | Michael Morpurgo, the author of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: \"Spielberg’s a wonderful storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.”[74] Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: \"It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused.\"[82] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything.\"[83] | For lead actor Jeremy Irvine, starring in his first film role, the filming process was intense at times, in particular the scene where the British cavalry, 130 horses in total and many hundreds of extras, charged the German machine gun lines. He explained: \"It’s the weapons of the old world—our men on horses—meeting the absolute destruction of these tools of mass slaughter. There was this line of machine guns and there’s this wall of lead coming out of these guns. There were real explosions at my feet, bodies flying through the air, stunt men getting shot at. It was terrifying. The smoke and the smell and the taste of the guns firing. It’s not difficult to act scared in that situation. There’s no doubt this was deliberate: not only to have the film look great, but to have that effect on the actors. It was an eye-opening scene.\"[14] | When actor Peter Mullan won the award for Best Film at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain for Neds, the film he wrote, directed and in which he acted, Spielberg insisted that Mullan should attend the ceremony on 26 September 2010 to accept his award in person, and re-arranged the War Horse shooting schedule accordingly.[84][85] | Spielberg commented on how he and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński developed the 'look' of the film: \"...it doesn't feel like Ryan at all ... it has a much more daguerrotype feel, much more brownish. We're not using any of the techniques we used on Ryan. The only similarity is that it is war and it is handheld.\"[31] | Longcross Studios, Longcross, Surrey, England, UK | Burrator Reservoir near Plymouth, England, UK | Castle Combe, Wiltshire, England, UK | Ditsworthy Warren, Devon, England, UK | Holwell Farm, Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon, England, UK | Stratfield Saye, Hampshire, England, UK | Bourne Woods, Farnham, Surrey, England, UK | Dartmoor, Devon, England, UK | Luton Hoo Estate, Luton, Bedfordshire, England, UK | Meavy, Devon, England, UK | Twickenham Film Studios, Twickenham, London, England, UK | Wisley Airfield, Wisley, Surrey, England, UK[86] | \"When I'm on an Indy movie, I'm watching Indiana Jones, not the horse he is riding ... Suddenly I'm faced with the challenge of making a movie where I not only had to watch the horse, I had to compel the audience to watch it along with me. I had to pay attention to what it was doing and understand its feelings. It was a whole new experience for me.\" | The pre-production period only allowed for three months to train the horses before shooting commenced.[87] The main horse trainer was Bobby Lovgren,[87] and other horse trainers included Dylan Jones, Bill Lawrence[88][89] and Zelie Bullen.[90][91] | During filming, fourteen different horses were used as the main horse character Joey, eight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as foals;[88][92] four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn.[87] Up to 280 horses were used in a single scene.[33] A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes sucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse characters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and markings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister was responsible for the 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the sketches of horses that are featured in the film.[93] Extra filming involving a bay foal took place in California in March 2011.[16] Working with horses on this scale was a new experience for Spielberg, who commented: \"The horses were an extraordinary experience for me, because several members of my family ride. I was really amazed at how expressive horses are and how much they can show what they’re feeling.\"[13] | Representatives of the American Humane Association were on set at all times to ensure the health and safety of all animals involved,[94] and the Association awarded the film an \"outstanding\" rating for the care that was taken of all the animals during the production.[95] However, a 2013 suit by former AHA employee Barbara Casey alleges that a horse was killed on-set, but the organisation chose to \"cover-up the death\" to protect Spielberg's reputation.[96] An animatronic horse was used for some parts of the scenes where Joey is trapped in barbed wire;[97] the wire was rubber prop wire.[95] | Film editor Michael Kahn spoke of his work on the film: \"We have some shots in War Horse that are just fantastic ... We shot it in Devon, and you know it's gorgeous down there, and the horses are beautiful and the farms are beautiful, beautiful scenery and every shot is gorgeous, and eventually you get to the war part of it and it's really, really something.\" Kahn had a trailer on set and edited the film during filming.[98] Kahn and Spielberg cut the film digitally on an Avid, rather than on film, a first time with this technology for Spielberg: \"He decided that he’d like to try it\", Kahn commented.[99][100] | After filming, further editing was undertaken at the U.K.'s Twickenham Film Studios, with the production moving back to the U.S. in November 2010.[80] Kahn also said of his work on the film: \"We put together here in Hollywood. It worked well ... Those English actors are awfully good and so were the horses. The horses were beautifully trained. For an editor there were a lot of match [frame] problems with the horses but the shooting was so good that I got everything I needed.”[15] | The film score by John Williams was recorded in late March and early April 2011.[98] Tuba player Jim Self reported in May 2011: \"For John Williams I [sic] recently finished recording for the film War Horse. It's a war movie so the score has a lot of brass—but it was gentle music often.\"[101] English folk singer John Tams, who wrote the songs for the stage production of War Horse, was approached by Spielberg and Williams about including one of his songs from the stageshow in the film.[52][102] In the liner notes to the film soundtrack cd, Spielberg wrote \"I feel that John has made a special gift to me of this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much of what you are going to hear.\"[103] In the premiere of three of the tracks on New York radio station WQXR’s \"Movies on the Radio\", broadcaster David Garland drew parallels with the work of British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.[104] | Visual effects for the film were undertaken by London-based company Framestore.[105] According to Spielberg, the film's only digital effects are three shots lasting three seconds, which were undertaken to ensure the safety of the horse involved: \"That's the thing I'm most proud of. Everything you see on screen really happened.\"[29] Kathleen Kennedy elaborated, stating \"We really did it very naturalistically. There isn't a lot of blood. Steven wasn't interested in bringing Private Ryan into it, but we did want to make a PG-13 movie.\"[22] Actor Tom Hiddleston said of the film that Spielberg had \"seen the stage play and he wanted to retain the magic and heartbeat of that ... It's a moving, powerful story you can take children to see, but it is still very upsetting ... People die, and it is war.\"[106]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"War Horse  by Michael Morpurgo","m_directed_by":"Steven Spielberg","m_produced_by":"Steven Spielberg Kathleen Kennedy","m_screenplay_by":"Lee Hall Richard Curtis","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"Emily Watson David Thewlis Peter Mullan Niels Arestrup Jeremy Irvine","m_music_by":"John Williams","m_cinematography":"Janusz Kamiński","m_edited_by":"Michael Kahn","m_production_company":"DreamWorks Pictures Reliance Entertainment Amblin Entertainment The Kennedy/Marshall Company","m_distributed_by":"Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures","m_release_dates":"December 25, 2011 (2011-12-25) |  |  |  | ","m_running_time":"146 minutes[1]","m_country":"United Kingdom United States","m_language":"English","m_budget":"$66 million","m_box_office":"$177.6 million[2] | War Horse is a 2011 American-British war drama film directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel of the same name set before and during World War I. | The film's cast includes Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Marsan, Niels Arestrup, Toby Kebbell, David Kross and Peter Mullan.[3][4] The film is produced by Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy, and executive produced by Frank Marshall and Revel Guest.[5] Long-term Spielberg collaborators Janusz Kamiński, Michael Kahn, Rick Carter and John Williams all worked on the film as cinematographer, editor, production designer, and music composer, respectively. | Produced by DreamWorks Pictures and released by Touchstone Pictures, War Horse became a box office success[2] and was met with positive reviews.[6] The film was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, two Golden Globe Awards and five BAFTAs. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ \"War Horse (12A)\".
