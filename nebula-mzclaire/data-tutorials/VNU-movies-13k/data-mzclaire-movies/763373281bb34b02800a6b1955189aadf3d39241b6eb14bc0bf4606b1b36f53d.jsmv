{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"In 1943, having expended enormous resources on recapturing escaped Allied prisoners of war (POWs), the Germans move the most determined to a new, high-security prisoner of war camp. The commandant, Luftwaffe Colonel von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells the senior British officer, Group Captain Ramsey (James Donald), \"There will be no escapes from this camp.\" Von Luger points out the various features of the new camp designed to prevent escape, as well as the advantages that the prisoners will receive as an incentive not to try. After several failed escape attempts on the first day, the POWs settle into life at the prison camp. | Meanwhile, Gestapo and SD agents bring RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) to the camp. Known as \"Big X\", Bartlett is introduced as the principal organiser of escapes. As Kuhn (Hans Reiser) leaves, he warns Bartlett that if he escapes again, he will be shot. However, locked up with \"every escape artist in Germany\", Bartlett immediately plans the greatest escape attempted, with tunnels for breaking out 250 prisoners, to the point that as many troops and resources as possible will be wasted on finding POWs instead of being used on the front line. | Teams are organised to support the effort. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner), an American in the RAF, is \"the scrounger\" who finds needed materials, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), \"the manufacturer,\" makes necessary tools like picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenants Danny Valinski (Charles Bronson) and William \"Willie\" Dickes (John Leyton) are \"the tunnel kings\" in charge of digging the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Andrew MacDonald (Gordon Jackson) acts as intelligence provider and Bartlett's second-in-command. Lieutenant Commander Eric Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) of the Royal Navy devises a method of spreading soil from the tunnels over the camp, under the guards' noses. Flight Lieutenant Griffith (Robert Desmond) acts as \"the tailor\", creating civilian outfits from scavenged cloth. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence), who becomes nearly blind due to progressive myopia caused by intricate work by candlelight; Hendley takes it upon himself to be Blythe's guide in the escape. The prisoners work on three tunnels simultaneously, calling them \"Tom\", \"Dick\", and \"Harry\". | USAAF Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen), the \"Cooler King\", irritates guards with frequent escape attempts and general irreverence. Hilts and RAF Flying Officer Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) conceive an escape attempt through a short tunnel at a blind spot right near the edge of the camp, a proposal which is accepted by Bartlett on the grounds that vetoing every independent escape attempt would raise suspicion of the collective escape attempt being planned. However, Hilts and Ives are caught and returned to the 'cooler'. Upon release from the cooler, Bartlett requests that Hilts use his next escape attempt as an opportunity for surveillance for the other prisoners; Hilts turns down Bartlett's request but assists the prisoners as a scrounger. Meanwhile, Hendley forms a friendship with German guard Werner, which he exploits on several occasions to smuggle documents and other items of importance to the prisoners. Soon, Bartlett orders \"Dick\" and \"Harry\" to be shut down, as \"Tom\" is closest to completion. | While the POWs enjoy a 4th of July celebration arranged by the three Americans, the guards discover \"Tom\". The mood drops to despair and Ives, hit hardest, walks in a daze to the barbed wire that surrounds the camp and climbs it in view of guards; Hilts runs to stop him but is too late, and Ives is shot dead near the top of the fence. The prisoners switch their efforts to \"Harry\", and Hilts agrees to reconnoitre outside the camp and allows himself to be recaptured. The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. | The last part of the tunnel is completed on the scheduled night for the escape, but it proves to somehow be twenty feet short of the woods. Knowing that there are no other options, Bartlett orders the escape to continue, and Hilts improvises a signal system to allow the prisoners to move between patrol sweeps. The claustrophobic Danny, having spent much of his time in the tunnel and barely surviving multiple cave-ins, nearly refuses to go, but is helped along by Willie. 76 prisoners manage to escape: however, an impatient Griffith is discovered while exiting the tunnel and the completion of the escape effort is thwarted. | After attempts to reach neutral Switzerland, Sweden, and Spain, almost all the POWs are recaptured or killed. Hendley and Blythe steal an aircraft to fly over the Swiss border, but the engine fails and they crash-land. Soldiers arrive and Blythe, his eyesight damaged, stands and is shot. Hendley surrenders and is captured as Blythe dies. | When Bartlett is identified in a crowded railway station by Gestapo agent Kuhn, Ashley-Pitt overpowers and shoots him with his own gun, but is killed by soldiers while attempting to escape. The resulting confusion allows Bartlett and MacDonald to slip away, but they are later caught while boarding a bus after MacDonald blunders by replying to a suspicious Gestapo agent who wishes them \"Good luck\" in English. Hilts steals a motorcycle and is pursued by German soldiers, jumps a first-line barbed wire fence at the German-Swiss border and drives on to the Neutral Zone, but becomes entangled in the second line of the barbed fence and is captured. | Three truckloads of recaptured POWs go down a country road and split off in three directions. One truck, containing Bartlett, MacDonald, Cavendish, Haynes, and others, stops in a field and the POWs are told to get out and \"stretch their legs\". They are shot dead under the pretense that they were trying to escape. In all, 50 escapees are murdered. Hendley and nine others are returned to the camp. Von Luger is relieved of command of the prison camp by the SS for failing to prevent the breakout. | Only three make it to safety: Danny and Willie steal a rowboat and proceed downriver to the Baltic coast, where they sneak aboard a Swedish merchant ship, while Sedgwick slips through the countryside on a stolen bicycle before hiding aboard a freight train to France, where he is guided by the Resistance to Spain. Hilts is returned into the camp alone in handcuffs and taken back to the cooler – ironically just as Von Luger is relieved of his command and taken out of the camp. Lieutenant Goff (Jud Taylor), one of the Americans, fetches Hilts's baseball and glove and throws them to him when Hilts and his guards pass by. The guard locks him in his cell and walks away, but momentarily pauses when he hears the familiar sound of Hilts bouncing his baseball against a cell wall. The film ends with the caption \"This picture is dedicated to the fifty.\"","m_cast":"Since the deaths of James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Angus Lennie, and Tom Adams in 2014, the surviving credited cast members are David McCallum, John Leyton, William Russell, George Mikell, Lawrence Montaigne, and Karl-Otto Alberty. Robert Graf died in 1966. Michael Paryla died in 1967.","m_reception":"The Great Escape grossed $11,744,471 at the box office,[31] after a budget of $4 million.[32] It became one of the highest grossing films of 1963, despite heavy competition. In the years since its release, its audience has broadened, cementing its status as a cinema classic.[33] It was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where McQueen won the Silver Prize for Best Actor.[34] | Critical and public response has been mostly enthusiastic, with a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[35] In 1963 New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote: \"But for much longer than is artful or essential, The Great Escape grinds out its tormenting story without a peek beneath the surface of any man, without a real sense of human involvement. It's a strictly mechanical adventure with make-believe men.\"[36] British film critic Leslie Halliwell described it as \"pretty good but overlong POW adventure with a tragic ending\".[37] In Time magazine 1963: \"The use of color photography is unnecessary and jarring, but little else is wrong with this film. With accurate casting, a swift screenplay, and authentic German settings, Producer-Director John Sturges has created classic cinema of action. There is no sermonizing, no soul probing, no sex. The Great Escape is simply great escapism\".[38] | In a 2006 poll in the United Kingdom, regarding the family film that television viewers would most want to see on Christmas Day, The Great Escape came in third, and was first among the choices of male viewers.[39] | In 2009, seven POWs returned to Stalag Luft III for the 65th anniversary of the escape[40] and watched the film. According to the veterans, many details of the first half depicting life in the camp were authentic, e.g. the machine-gunning of Ives, who snaps and tries to scale the fence, and the actual digging of the tunnels. In 2014, the RAF staged a commemoration of the escape attempt, with 50 serving personnel carrying a photograph of one of the men shot.[41] | Nominated Academy Award for Film Editing (Ferris Webster) | Nominated Golden Globe Award for Best Picture | Winner Moscow International Film Festival Best Actor (Steve McQueen) | Nominated Moscow International Film Festival Grand Prix (John Sturges) | Selected National Board of Review Top Ten Films of Year | Nominated Writers Guild of America Best Written American Drama (James Clavell, W.R. Burnett) (Screenplay Adaptation)","m_production":"The story was adapted by James Clavell, W. R. Burnett, and Walter Newman from Paul Brickhill's book The Great Escape. Brickhill had been a prisoner at Stalag Luft III during World War II. | The film was to a fair extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with numerous compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious and events glossed over, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by aircraft or motorcycle: the motorcycle sequence was a request from McQueen, an avid motorcyclist, who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump (done by Bud Ekins).[3] Nor were the recaptured prisoners executed in one place at the same time. The screenwriters significantly increased the involvement of American POWs; the real escape was by largely British and other allied personnel. A few American officers in the POW camp initially contributed towards construction of the tunnels, and worked on the early escape plans; however, American personnel were moved to a remote compound seven months before the escape, ending their involvement.[4][5][6] As well, the film suggests the three prisoners who escaped to freedom were British, Polish, and Australian; in reality, they were Norwegian (Jens Müller & Per Bergsland) and Dutch (Bram van der Stok).[7] | The film omits mention of the crucial role Canadians played in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. Of the 1,800 or so POWs in the compound, 600 were involved in preparations for the escape; 150 of these were Canadian. Wally Floody, an RCAF pilot and mining engineer who was the real-life \"tunnel king\", was engaged as a technical advisor for the film.[8] | Ex-POWs asked film-makers to exclude details about the help they received from their home countries, such as maps, papers, and tools hidden in gift packages, lest it jeopardise future POW escapes. The film-makers complied.[9] | Steve McQueen, in a role based on at least three pilots, David M. Jones, John Dortch Lewis,[10] and William Ash,[11][12][13] has been credited with the most significant performance. Critic Leonard Maltin wrote that \"the large, international cast is superb, but the standout is McQueen; it's easy to see why this cemented his status as a superstar.\"[14] McQueen served in the US Marines after WWII, and is credited for saving fellow Marines' lives during an Arctic exercise. | Richard Attenborough was cast as Sqn Ldr Roger Bartlett RAF (\"Big X\"), a character based on Roger Bushell, the South African-born British POW who was the mastermind of the real Great Escape.[15] This was the film that first brought Attenborough to wide popular attention in the United States. During the Second World War, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force. He volunteered to fly with the Film Unit and after further training, where he sustained permanent ear damage, qualified as a sergeant, flying on several missions over Europe filming from the rear gunner's position to record the outcome of Bomber Command sorties. | Group Captain Ramsey RAF (the \"SBO\") was based on Group Captain Herbert Massey, a WWI vet who had volunteered in WWII. He is played by James Donald. Massey walked with a limp, and so did Ramsey in the movie who walked with a cane. Massey had suffered severe wounds to the same leg in both wars. There would be no escape for him but as Senior British Officer, he had to know what was going on. Group Captain Massey had been a veteran escaper himself and had been in trouble with the Gestapo. His experience allowed him to offer sound advice to the X-Organisation.[16] Another officer that had most likely inspired the character of Ramsey was Wing Commander Harry Day. There was an uncanny resemblance between Harry Day and James Donald as Group Captain Ramsey in this picture. | Flt Lt Colin Blythe RAF (\"The Forger\") was based on Tim Walenn and played by Donald Pleasence.[17] Pleasence himself had served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. He was shot down and spent a year in German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft I. | Charles Bronson had been a gunner in the USAAF and was wounded, but had not been shot down. Like his character, Danny Valinski, he suffered from claustrophobia. | James Garner had been a soldier in the Korean War and was twice wounded. He was a scrounger during that time, as is his character Flt Lt Hendley.[18] | Hannes Messemer was cast as the Kommandant of Stalag Luft III, \"Colonel von Luger,\" a character based on Oberst Friedrich Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau.[19] He had been a POW in Russia during World War II and had escaped by walking hundreds of miles to the German border.[20] | Angus Lennie's Flying Officer Archibald Ives, \"The Mole\", was based on Jimmy Kiddel, who was shot dead while trying to scale the fence.[21] | The film is accurate in showing that only three escapees made home runs, although the people who made them differed from those in the film. The escape of Danny and Willie in the film is based on two Norwegians who escaped by boat to Sweden, Per Bergsland and Jens Müller. The successful escape of James Coburn's Australian character Sedgwick (the manufacturer) via Spain was based on Dutchman Bram van der Stok. Coburn, an American, was cast in the role of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick who was an amalgamation of Flt Lt Albert Hake, an Australian serving in the RAF and the camps compass maker, and Johnny Travis, the real manufacturer.[22] | Tilman 'Til Kiwe' Kiver played the German guard \"Frick\". He is the one who fires his pistol at Steve McQueen's character during the escape. Kiwe had been a German paratrooper officer who was captured and held prisoner at a POW camp in Colorado. He made several escape attempts, dying his uniform and carrying forged papers. He was captured in the St. Louis train station during one escape attempt. He won the Knight's Cross before his capture and was the cast member who had actually done many of the exploits shown in the film. | The film was made at the Bavaria Film Studio in the Munich suburb of Geiselgasteig in rural Bavaria where sets for the barrack interiors and tunnels were constructed. The camp was constructed in a clearing in the Perlacher forest near the studio.[23][24] The German town near the real prison camp was Sagan (now Żagań, Poland); it was renamed Neustadt in the film.[24] Many scenes were filmed in and around the town of Füssen in Bavaria, including its railway station. The nearby district of Pfronten[25] with its distinctive St. Nikolaus Church and scenic background also features often in the film.[24] Many scenes involving trains and stations were filmed near Deisenhofen station and on the Großhesselohe - Holzkirchen railway line.[26] The castle Hendley and Blythe fly by while attempting to escape is Neuschwanstein Castle.[27] | The film depicts the tunnel codenamed Tom as having its entrance under a stove and Harry's as in a drain sump in a washroom. In reality, Dick's entrance was the drain sump, Harry's was under the stove, and Tom's was in a darkened corner next to a stove chimney.[28] | The motorcycle chase scenes culminating in the jumping of the barbed wire were shot on meadows outside Füssen, and the \"barbed wire\" that Hilts crashed into before being recaptured was simulated by strips of rubber tied around barbless wire, constructed by the cast and crew in their spare time.[29] The jump scene was performed by stuntman Bud Ekins in place of Steve McQueen. Other parts of the chase scene were done by McQueen playing both Hilts and the soldiers chasing him because of McQueen's ability on a motorcycle.[30]","m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"The Great Escape 1950 novel  by Paul Brickhill","m_directed_by":"John Sturges","m_produced_by":"John Sturges","m_screenplay_by":"James Clavell W.
