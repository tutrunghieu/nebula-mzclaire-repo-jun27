It is the first full-length sound film in English of Shakespeare's play—other versions are videotaped productions which were made for television, including John Sichel's 1973 version and Jack Gold's 1980 BBC production. | The title character is the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons), not the Jewish moneylender Shylock (Al Pacino) who is the more prominent character. This adaptation follows the text, but omits much. Director Michael Radford believed that Shylock was Shakespeare's first great tragic hero who reaches a catastrophe due to his own flaws.[2][3] The film begins with text and a montage of how the Jewish community is abused by the Christian population of Venice and brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish ghetto in Venice. | The film is a co-production between the United Kingdom, Italy, and Luxembourg. |  | ","m_marketing":null,"m_reference":"^ a b c The Merchant of Venice at Box Office Mojo | ^ a b Podgorski, Daniel (November 5, 2015). \"Remakes are Not your Enemy: Analyzing a Scene from Michael Radford’s Film Version of The Merchant of Venice\".
