{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Soon after World War I is over, \"Spig\" Wead (John Wayne), along with John Dale Price (Ken Curtis), tries to prove to the Navy the value of aviation in combat. To do this, Wead pushes the Navy to compete in racing and endurance competitions. Several races are against the US Army aviation team led by Captain Herbert Allen Hazard (based on Jimmy Doolittle – played by Kenneth Tobey). | Wead spends most of his time either flying or horsing around with his teammates, meaning that his wife Minnie, or \"Min\" (Maureen O'Hara), and children are ignored. | The night Wead is promoted to fighter squadron commander, he falls down a flight of stairs at home, breaks his neck and is paralyzed. When \"Min\" tries to console him he rejects her and the family. He will only let his Navy mates like \"Jughead\" Carson (Dan Dailey) and Price near him. \"Jughead\" visits the hospital almost daily to encourage Frank's rehabilitation (\"I'm gonna move that toe\"). Carson also pushes \"Spig\" to get over his depression, try to walk, and start writing. Wead achieves some success in all three goals.[6] | After great success in Hollywood, Wead returns to active sea duty with the Navy in World War II, developing the idea of smaller escort, or \"jeep,\" carriers to augment the main aircraft carrier force. A heart attack sends Wead home before the war's end. | Director John Ford is himself represented in the film, in the humorously-named character of film director John Dodge, played by another Ford favorite, Ward Bond.","m_cast":null,"m_reception":null,"m_production":null,"m_sequel":null,"m_based_on":"the life and writings of Commander Frank W. \"Spig\" Wead","m_directed_by":"John Ford","m_produced_by":"Charles Schnee","m_screenplay_by":"Frank Fenton and William Wister Haines","m_story_by":null,"m_starring":"John Wayne | Dan Dailey | Maureen O'Hara | Ward Bond","m_music_by":"Jeff Alexander","m_cinematography":"Paul C.
