{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"A small film crew visits the old, abandoned mansion of famous artist Ichirō Mamiya, who left several precious frescos inside his house. The team wants to restore and publish the paintings and film a documentary about Mamiya and his arts. The team includes Kazuo (Shingo Yamashiro), his daughter Emi (Nokko), producer Akiko (Nobuko Miyamoto), photographer Taguchi (Ichiro Furutachi) and art restorer Asuka (Fukumi Kuroda). After they enter the mansion, paranormal events betray the presence of a poltergeist. Soon, Asuka is possessed by the infuriated ghost of Lady Mamiya, Ichirō's wife. The team discovers a makeshift grave where a toddler is buried. The boy is Ichirō and Lady Mamiya's son, who fell into the house's incinerator one day and burned alive. Since then, Lady Mamiya's ghost haunts the mansion, killing any trespassers. In the end, only Kazuo, Emi, and Akiko survive, by reuniting Mamiya with her beloved son, and so giving them peace. When Kazuo, Emi, and Akiko leave the mansion, it begins to collapse.","m_cast":"Kazuo Hoshino (星野 和夫, Hoshino Kazuo?) (Shingo Yamashiro) – Director of the crew. A firm and friendly guy, but anxious and jumpy. Throughout the movie, his affections for Akiko are apparent but he does not reveal his feelings to her. Kazuo is always worried about his daughter Emi. | Emi Hoshino (星野 エミ, Hoshino Emi?) (Nokko) – Daughter of Kazuo. She lost her mother as toddler and sees Akiko as her “big sister”. Emi is a student on summer vacation. She assists her father as a guide instead of staying at home alone. Near end of the movie, she is kidnapped by the evil ghost of Mamiya and is rescued by Akiko. | Ryō Taguchi (田口 亮, Taguchi Ryō?) (Ichiro Furutachi) – Photographer of the crew. He is a womaniser and stalks Asuka. When Asuka is lured away by Mamiya, he follows her. After being fried in half by the mansion's shadows, he is bludgeoned to death by panicked Asuka. | Akiko Hayakawa (早川 秋子, Hayakawa Akiko?) (Nobuko Miyamoto) – Producer. She is an extremely self-confident woman with the strongest personality of the crew and the final say. She seems to be aware of Kazuo´s feelings for her, but pretends to be oblivious. She is the primary heroine of the movie and saves Emi from Lady Mamiya by pretending to be Emi's dead mother. | Asuka (アスカ?) (Fukumi Kuroda) – Reporter. She is also a professional art restorer and therefore responsible for the preservation of the sought-out frescos. Her goal is to get famous from the documentary about Ichirō Yamamura and his paintings. After killing Taguchi, she is overcome with emotion and does not notice a falling battle axe that smashes straight into her forehead, killing her. | Ichirō Mamiya (間宮 一郎, Mamiya Ichirō?) – A famous artist who disappeared 30 years ago in his mansion. No one knows what exactly happened to him, but his death is likely connected to the suicide of his beloved wife. | Lady Mamiya (間宮夫人, Mamiya Fujin?) (Machiko Watanabe) – Beloved wife of Ichirō. 30 years ago, she lost her son in an accident. After the toddler´s death, Mamiya could not cope with the loss and became insane from the idea of giving her lost son playmates. In attempts to do so, she kidnapped and killed toddlers by burning them in the incinerator. When caught red-handed by local villagers, who immediately pursue her, she commits suicide in the very furnace her son died in. Her infuriated soul is trapped in the house due to a magical memorial outside of the house. It seems that Mamiya is upset about the circumstances concerning the close proximity of her memorial and her son's grave.","m_reception":"Tom Mes of Midnight Eye noted that the script echoed Robert Wise's The Haunting.
