{"rawJson":null,"m_plot":"Child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is an expert in an experimental treatment for coma patients: a virtual reality device that allows her to enter into the minds of her patients and attempt to coax them into consciousness. When serial killer Carl Rudolph Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls into a coma before the FBI can locate his final victim, Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) persuades Deane to enter Stargher's mind and discover the victim's location.[1] Stargher's victim is imprisoned in a cell in the form of a glass enclosure that is slowly filling with water by means of an automatic timer. | Deane enters Stargher's twisted mind, where she is confronted by both the violent and the innocent parts of the killer's psyche. The innocent half shows her the abuse he suffered at his father's hands and the birth of his pathology when he drowned an injured bird as a mercy killing. Deane attempts to nurture the innocent side of Stargher's mind, but his murderous half thwarts her at every turn. | Despite Deane's best efforts, she becomes trapped in Stargher's dark dreamscape. Novak volunteers to enter Stargher's mind and attempts to rescue her. He breaks Deane from Stargher's hold and discovers clues to the whereabouts of his victim. Novak relates his revelations to his team and they are able to track down the location of Stargher's victim (Stargher had been entrusted by a company to take care of an advanced water pump, which he used to fill the cell with water). Novak discovers Stargher's secret underground room and saves Stargher's victim just in time. Meanwhile, Deane decides to reverse the process and pull Stargher's mind into her own. She presents Stargher's innocent side with a paradise, but his murderous side is always present and manifests as a serpent. This time, however, Deane has all the power; she attacks the serpent/Stargher but discovers she cannot destroy one half without killing the other. Stargher's innocent side reminds her of the bird he drowned, and she kills him to put him out of his misery. She adopts Stargher's dog and successfully uses her new technique on her other coma patient (Colton James).","m_cast":"Jennifer Lopez as Dr. Catherine Deane | Vincent D'Onofrio as Carl Rudolph Stargher | Vince Vaughn as Special Agent Peter Novak | Jake Weber as Special Agent Gordon Ramsey | Dylan Baker as Henry West | Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Dr. Miriam Kent | Tara Subkoff as Julia Hickson | Catherine Sutherland as Anne Marie Vicksey | Colton James as Edward Baines | Musetta Vander as Ella Baines | Patrick Bauchau as Lucien Baines | Jake Thomas as Young Carl Rudolph Stargher | James Gammon as Teddy Lee | Dean Norris as Cole | Pruitt Taylor Vince as Dr. Reid | Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls as Stargher's victim","m_reception":"Critical reaction to The Cell has been mixed, with a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 146 reviews with the site's consensus reporting that \"The Cell offers disturbing, stunning eye candy, but it is undermined by a weak and shallow plotline that offers nothing new.\"[4] | One of the most positive reviews came from Roger Ebert who awarded the film four stars out of four, writing: \"For all of its visual pyrotechnics, it's also a story where we care about the characters; there's a lot at stake at the end, and we're involved. I know people who hate it, finding it pretentious or unrestrained; I think it's one of the best films of the year.\"[5] Ebert later placed the film on his list of \"The Best 10 Movies of 2000\", writing: \"Tarsem, the director, is a visual virtuoso who juggles his storylines effortlessly; it's dazzling, the way he blends so many notes, styles and genres into a film so original.\"[6] James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing: \"The Cell becomes the first serial killer feature in a long time to take the genre in a new direction. Not only does it defy formulaic expectations, but it challenges the viewer to think and consider the horrors that can turn an ordinary child into an inhuman monster. There are no easy answers, and The Cell doesn't pretend to offer any. Instead, Singh presents audiences with the opportunity to go on a harrowing journey. For those who are up to the challenge, it's worth spending time in The Cell.\"[7] Peter Travers from the Rolling Stone magazine mentioned that \"Tarsem uses the dramatically shallow plot to create a dream world densely packed with images of beauty and terror that cling to the memory even if you don't want them to.\" giving the film a positive review. | Conversely, Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it \"contrived\", \"arbitrary\", and \"overdrawn\".[8] Slate's David Edelstein panned the film as well, writing: \"When I go to a serial-killer flick, I don't want to see the serial killer (or even his inner child) coddled and empathized with and forgiven. I want to see him shot, stabbed, impaled, eviscerated, and finally engulfed — shrieking — in flames. The Cell serves up some of the most gruesomely misogynistic imagery in years, then ends with a bid for understanding.\"[9] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader remarked, \"There's almost no plot here and even less character — just a lot of pretexts for S&M imagery, Catholic decor, gobs of gore, and the usual designer schizophrenia.\".[10] Additionally, Empire Magazine stated that The Cell is \"at times beautiful and always disturbing, this is strangely devoid of meaning.\" with a final score of two stars out of five. | The film received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Makeup.","m_production":null,"m_sequel":"A sequel was released direct to DVD on June 16, 2009.
